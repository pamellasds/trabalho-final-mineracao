Methods: Open-access global databases concerning the incidence of gastric cancer and its risk/protective factors were identified through an extensive search on the Web. As its distribution was neither normal nor symmetric, the cancer incidence of each country was categorized according to ranges of percentile distribution. The association of each risk/protective factor with exposure was measured between the extreme ranges of the incidence of gastric cancer (under the 25th percentile and above the 75th percentile) by the use of the Mann-Whitney test, considering a significance level of 0.05. Results: A variable amount of data omission was observed among all of the factors under study. A weak or nonexistent correlation between the incidence of gastric cancer and the study variables was shown by a visual analysis of scatterplot dispersion. In contrast, an analysis of categorized incidence revealed that the countries with the highest human development index (HDI) values had the highest rates of obesity in males and the highest consumption of alcohol, tobacco, fruits, vegetables and meat, which were associated with higher incidences of gastric cancer. There was no significant difference for the risk factors of obesity in females and fish consumption. Conclusion: Higher HDI values, coupled with a higher prevalence of male obesity and a higher per capita consumption of alcohol, tobacco, fruits, vegetables and meat, are associated with a higher incidence of gastric cancer based on an analysis of populational global data. © 2013 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications. Future work and open issues are also discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Knowledge sharing; Ontology engineering; Semantic interoperability; Unsupervised document classification; Vector space models","Clustering algorithms; Construction; Construction industry; Data mining; Engineering research; Information management; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantics; Vectors; Document Classification; Knowledge-sharing; Ontology engineering; Semantic interoperability; Vector space models; Vector spaces","Costa, R.; Centre of Technology and Systems, UNINOVAPortugal; email: rddc@uninova.pt",,"Springer New York LLC",09565515,,JIMNE,,"English","J Intell Manuf",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027945652

There are multiple methods to measure sentiments, varying from lexical-based approaches to machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some those methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e. positive or negative) of a message, as the current literature does not provide a comparison among existing methods. This comparison is crucial to allow us to understand the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in the context of OSNs messages. This work aims at filling this gap by presenting a comparison between 8 popular sentiment analysis methods. Our analysis compares these methods in terms of coverage and in terms of correct sentiment identification. We also develop a new method that combines existing approaches in order to provide the best coverage results with competitive accuracy.

Land use and land cover maps (LULC) are important tools for this analysis, as well as other remote sensing techniques. The object oriented analysis classifies the image according to patterns as texture, color, shape, and context. However, there are many attributes to be analyzed, and data mining tools helped us to learn about them and to choose the best ones. In this way, the aim of this paper is to describe data mining techniques and results of a heterogeneous area, as the municipality of Silva Jardim, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The municipality has forest, urban areas, pastures, water bodies, agriculture and also some shadows as objects to be represented. Worldview 2 satellite image from 2010 was used and LULC classification was processed using the values that data mining software has provided according to the J48 method. Afterwards, this classification was analyzed, and the verification was made by the confusion matrix, being possible to evaluate the accuracy (58,89%). The best results were in classes water and forest which have more homogenous reflectance. Because of that, the model has been adapted, in order to create a model for the most homogeneous classes. As result, 2 new classes were created, some values and some attributes changed, and others added. In the end, the accuracy was 89,33%. It is important to highlight this is not a conclusive paper; there are still many steps to develop in highly heterogeneous surfaces. © 2013 SPIE.","data mining; land use and land cover classification; model adaptation; object oriented analysis","Data-mining software; Forest fragmentations; Heterogeneous surface; Land use and land cover; Land-use and land cover classifications; Model Adaptation; Object-oriented analysis; Remote sensing techniques; Forestry; Land use; Object oriented programming; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Tools; Data mining; Computer Programing; Data Processing; Forestry; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Signals","Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ, Geography Department, Ilha Do Fundao Campi, 21941-590 - Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,0277786X,9780819497611,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889036009

Due to the large amount of data obtained daily, incremental techniques have been proposed to process medical data stream. In this paper we present an incremental decision tree classifier called StARMiner Tree (ST), which is based on Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) technique, to mine medical data. Different from VFDT, our proposed method ST does not depend on the number of reading samples to split a node. Because of it, ST is less conservative and describes the data since their first samples, being appropriate to be employed in medical environment, where not always a large number of data samples are available. We applied ST to four medical datasets, comparing the ST performance to the VFDT. The results indicated that ST is well-suited to deal with medical data streams, presenting high accuracy and low execution time. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computational resources; Decision tree classifiers; Incremental techniques; Medical data sets; Number of datum; Second opinions; Statistical decision tree; Very fast decision trees; Data communication systems; Data mining; Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Diagnosis","Federal University of São Carlos, Computer Science DepartmentBrazil",,,,9781479910533,,,"English","Proc.

In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms.

A particularly promising approach is to apply established data mining techniques in order to produce a model and make forecasts. The nature of the forecast can then be rendered using visualization techniques in order to assess operational decisions, simultaneously benefiting from generic and powerful data mining techniques, and using visualization to understand these results in the context of the actual problem of interest which may be very specific. Previous approaches to visualization in similar contexts use iso surfaces to visualize densities, these methods ignore recent improvements in interactive 3D visualization such as volume rendering and cut-planes, these methods also ignore what is often a key problem of interest comparing two different stochastic processes, finally previous methods have not paid sufficient attention to differences between estimation of densities and point processes (or Cox processes). This paper seeks to address all of these shortcomings and make recommendations for the trade-offs between visualization techniques for operational decision making. Finally we also demonstrate the ability to include interactive 3D plots within a paper by rendering an iso surface using 3D portable document format (PDF). © Springer-Verlag 2013.",,"Computational technique; Interactive 3d visualizations; Operational decision making; Operational decisions; Portable document formats; Real-world planning; Visual data mining; Visualization technique; Artificial intelligence; Geographic information systems; Random processes; Three dimensional; Visualization; Volume rendering; Data mining","Instituto de Matemática, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",,,03029743,9783642403187,,,"English","Lect.

Techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Statistics are used to help in an automatic classification. In a previous work, we proposed a method for classification problems based on Self-Organizing Maps ANN (SOM) and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) statistical classifier. The SOMkNN classifier, as we call this combination, is much faster than the traditional kNN and it keeps equivalent rates results. We propose a fine-tuning for this classifier here, which consists of a neuron relocation of the SOM map. The experiments presented compare SOMkNN with and without fine-tuning. Experiments using 8 databases, 6 of which are available in the UCI repository, the fine-tuning results are an improvement classification rate in 7 databases and in the last one the result is the same. The results indicate a trend of classification rate improvement with the application of the fine tuning technique.

With the intent of giving a contribution to the reduction of such evasion, this research highlights the importance of considering students' affective states, trying to motivate them to study and work out their difficulties, with the assistance of computer systems. For research validation purposes, a tool was built to: a) infer the student's affective state of frustration while solving exercises of algorithms; b) detect signs associated with frustration, to provide resources to support student learning. Case studies were conducted with students of algorithms at the Faculty of Technology Senac Pelotas, in 2011 and 2012.

However, the excess of information available may confuse and hinder the access to specific information. An alternative is the adoption of systems that provide automatic recommendations according to the profile of a user community. This work aimed to develop a recommender system based on data mining techniques to recommend content regarding the sugarcane crop. The adopted recommendation model relies on recommendation lists that are association rules between web pages, produced from the data users' browsing. The system was deployed on the portal of Embrapa Information Agency, which is a web system that aims to organize process, store and disseminate agricultural technological information. Among the results achieved with the system, it can be highlighted a knowledge base built with association rules, that describes the behavior of a user community and can indicate the most important links in web pages concerning sugarcane. With the adoption of this recommender system, the main benefits to users are: a) detailed information of production stages, with indications of reference material and different sources of reliable statistics; b) information that favors the efficient production considering technical, environmental, social and economic aspects; c) support to public and private stakeholders in planning and decision making; d) transfer of current knowledge with a friendly language for the sugarcane industry.","Agricultural technological information; Association rules; Bounce rate; Data mining","agricultural technology; data mining; decision making; industrial development; information technology; Internet; stakeholder; statistical analysis; sugar cane","de Barros, F.

Focusing on Gaussian RBF kernels, we propose a grid-search procedure for SVM parameter selection which is economic in its running time and does not require user intervention. Based on probabilistic assumptions of standardized data, this procedure works by filtering out parameter values that are not likely to yield reasonable classification accuracy. We instantiate this procedure in the popular WEKA data mining toolbox and show its performance on real datasets. © Springer-Verlag 2013.",,"Classification accuracy; Experimental comparison; Parameter selection; Probabilistic assumptions; RBF kernels; Real data sets; Running time; User intervention; Artificial intelligence; Soft computing; Support vector machines","Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil",,,03029743,9783642451102,,,"English","Lect.

The DT is equivalent to a morphological erosion of the binary image by a specific structuring function. However, this erosion can be decomposed by a sequence of erosions using small structuring functions. Classical and efficient algorithms of the DT are implemented on CPU. New 1D and 2D algorithms are implemented on GPU, using decomposition of structuring functions, inspired by implementations of convolution filters.

However, providing a meaningful layout while avoiding visual clutter is still a challenge. In this work we combine word clouds and a rigid-body simulation engine into an intuitive visualization tool that allows a user to visualize and interact with the content of document collections using a single overlap-free layout. The proposed force scheme ensures that neighboring documents are kept close to each other during and after layout change. Each group of neighboring documents formed on the layout generates a word cloud. A multi-seeded procedure guarantees a harmonious arrangement of distinct word clouds in visual space. The visual metaphor employs disks to represent document instances where the size of each disk defines the importance of the document in the collection. To keep the visualization clean and intuitive, only the most relevant documents are depicted as disks while the remaining ones are either displayed as smaller glyphs to help convey density information or simply removed from the layout. Hidden instances are moved together with its neighbors during rigid-body simulation, should they become visible later, but are not processed individually. This shadow movement avoids excess calculations by the force-based scheme, thus ensuring scalability and interactivity. © 2013 IEEE.","Information visualization; Multidimensional projection; Rigid-body simulation; Text visualization; Word clouds","Information visualization; Multidimensional projection; Rigid-body simulations; Text visualization; Word clouds; Data mining; Information systems; Telecommunication traffic; Visualization","FACOM, UFMS, Campo Grande, Brazil",,,15301834,9780769550992,,,"English","Braz.

The clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution. Clustering ensembles have emerged as a prominent method for improving robustness, stability and accuracy of clustering solutions. So far, many contributions have been made to find consensus clustering. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is the consensus function. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is proposed to solve the consensus clustering problem. We find that the particle swarm clustering algorithm is efficient for this problem. An empirical study compares the accuracy of our proposed algorithms with other consensus clustering methods including voting on five data sets.

One of the research areas that have recently evolved significantly at this point is video summarization, which consists of generating a short version of a certain video, such that the users can grasp the central message transmitted by the original video. Many of the video summarization approaches make use of clustering algorithms, with the goal of extracting the most important frames of the videos to compose the final summary. However, special clustering algorithms based on a spectral approach have obtained superior results than those obtained with classical clustering algorithms, not only in video summarization techniques but also in other fields, such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. This work proposes a method for summarization of videos, regardless of their genre, using spectral clustering algorithms.

In special, far-end crosstalk, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Impulsive Noise (IN) are of greatest concern and study. In DSL world, there are many noise mitigation techniques, but to know the impairment as a priori knowledge is a step necessary to apply the appropriate technique. In this paper we propose a new methodology for noise identification on real-time. Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithms are used in order to classify in real time the absence of noise or the predominance of IN, crosstalk or RFI. The algorithms are applied to a database composed by management information base (MIB) metrics. In order to ensure the database diversity, several DSL topologies using real cables were created and evaluated. In order to choose the best CI algorithm, a benchmarking was performed comparing the results achieved by naive Bayes, Bayesian belief networks and artificial neural networks based on backpropagation and on Radial Basis Function (RBF). The results demonstrate the potential use of CI for noise identification in DSL networks through MIB metrics and the most difficult noise to be identified is pointed. Tests indicate the RBF algorithm achieving the best result with 99.6% of accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.","backhaul; data mining; DSL; monitoring; network measurement; noise identification; real time systems","backhaul; Computational Intelligence algorithms; Digital subscriber line technologies; Management information base; Network measurement; Noise identification; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Radio frequency interference; Backpropagation algorithms; Bayesian networks; Data mining; DSL; Interactive computer systems; Monitoring; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Real time systems; Telecommunication lines","Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Brazil",,,21621039,9781479910861,,,"English","Int.

Furthermore, we propose a pedagogical agent model that uses text mining techniques to identify when students deviate from the main topics that should be addressed in their discussions in a real time chat. Another important function enabled by the use of the text mining tool involves the assessment of the discussion relevance in relation to the base text, which supports the pedagogical agent decision towards a more adequate intervention. The conception of using text mining to guide the pedagogical agent in the mediation of the students' discussions has been based on previous research that has already shown how this particular mining tool could support educators' work in the evaluation of essays and of students' contributions in discussion forums.

Students may require instruction and feedback to help them exploit the learning environment to its full potential. To provide the necessary assistance, an intelligent tutoring system is proposed.

Dimensionality reduction techniques have been widely used to produce visual representation of document collections. Focusing on multidimensional projection techniques, good visual results are produced depending on how representative terms to discriminate the documents are chosen to compose the vector space model (VSM). To define a good VSM it is necessary to apply filters during the preprocessing in order to eliminate terms using their frequency. For that, the user must evaluate the term frequency histogram based on his/her expertise in the text subject and decide the threshold value for frequency cut. Usually it is a trial and error approach that requires the user to verify the quality of visual representation after each trial. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach that applies the Otsu's Threshold Selection Method for computing a threshold using a term frequency histogram. We conducted experiments that have shown our approach generates visual representations as good as those generated with a threshold obtained by trial and error approach. The contribution of our approach is that users with non expertise are able to generate good visual representations and the time to get a good threshold is decreased. © 2013 IEEE.","Otsu's Threshold Selection Method; Term Frequency Thresholding; Vector Space Model Computation; Visual Text Mining","Dimensionality reduction techniques; Text mining; Threshold selection; Thresholding; Trial-and-error approach; Vector space models; Visual representations; Visualization technique; Data mining; Vector spaces; Visualization; Text processing","Faculdade de Ciěncias e Tecnologia, UNESP - Univ Estadual Paulista, Departamento de Mateḿatica e Computação, Presidente Prudente/SP, Brazil",,,10939547,9780769550497,,,"English","Proc.

So, we should follow set of features that at first; are without any noise; secondly, having a little correlation with other features. In other words, we should use instances that are distinctive with other features. So, in this paper we present a combined approach to consider how factors such as distinct features and instances are useful for extracting the rules. In this approach we used a trained neural network to explore useful features, clustering to find out the best instances from dataset and finally we used artificial immune system for rules extraction. In order to evaluating of our introduced approach, we applied it on the UCI dataset of breast cancer diagnosis. Our experiments demonstrate that the combined proposed approach generates reliable rules and contributes more accuracy eventually; these results show the proposed method has %5.9 better accuracy relative to CART method.

KIR genes are hugely polymorphic both in the number of genes an individual carries and in the number of alleles identified. We have previously developed the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND, http://www.allelefrequencies.net), which captures worldwide frequencies of alleles, genes and haplotypes for several immune genes, including KIR genes, in healthy populations, covering >4 million individuals. Here, we report the creation of a new database within AFND, named KIR and Diseases Database (KDDB), capturing a large quantity of data derived from publications in which KIR genes, alleles, genotypes and/or haplotypes have been associated with infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis C, HIV, malaria), autoimmune disorders (e.g. type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis), cancer and pregnancy-related complications. KDDB has been created through an extensive manual curation effort, extracting data on more than a thousand KIR-disease records, comprising >50 000 individuals. KDDB thus provides a new community resource for understanding not only how KIR genes are associated with disease, but also, by working in tandem with the large data sets already present in AFND, where particular genes, genotypes or haplotypes are present in worldwide populations or different ethnic groups. We anticipate that KDDB will be an important resource for researchers working in immunogenetics. © The Author(s) 2013.

On the other hand, the number of available trajectories generated by GPS devices is growing.

The proposed methodology allows selecting the most representative data to describe how speeds are distributed along the days of week as well as along the time of the day.

Some algorithms have been proposed to perform incremental mining of process models. However, these algorithms do not provide all aspects of evolutionary learning, such as update and exclusion of elements from a process model. This happens when updates in the process definition occur, forcing a model already discovered to be refreshed. This paper presents new techniques to perform incremental mining of execution logs. It enables the discovery of changes in the process instances, keeping the discovered process model synchronized with the process being executed. Discovery results can be used in various ways by business analysts and software architects, e.g. documentation of legacy systems or for re-engineering purposes.","Evolutionary learning; Incremental process mining; Legacy systems; Process mining","Business analysts; Business process model; Evolutionary Learning; Incremental mining; Incremental process; Process definition; Process mining; Software architects; Data mining; Information systems; Legacy systems; Software architecture; Evolutionary algorithms","Department of Informatics, UFRGS, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil",,,,9789898565600,,,"English","ICEIS - Proc.

Credit card transactions, monitoring networks, sensors and telecommunications are some examples among many applications that generate large volumes of data in an automated way. Data streams storage and knowledge extraction techniques differ from those used on traditional data. In the context of data stream classification many incremental techniques has been proposed. In this paper we present an incremental decision tree algorithm called StARMiner Tree (ST), which is based on Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) system, which deals with numerical data and uses a method based on statistics as a heuristic to decide when to split a node and also to choose the best attribute to be used in the test at a node. We applied ST in four datasets, two synthetic and two real-world, comparing its performance to the VFDT. In all experiments ST achieved a better accuracy, dealing well with noise data and describing well the data from the earliest examples. However, in three of four experiments ST created a bigger tree. The obtained results indicate that ST is a good classifier using large and smaller datasets, maintaining good accuracy and execution time.","Anytime algorithm; Classification; Data stream mining; Decision tree; Starminer tree; VFDT","Any-time algorithms; Credit card transactions; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Starminer tree; Statistical decision tree; Very fast decision trees; VFDT; Classification (of information); Data communication systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Experiments; Heuristic methods; Information systems; Numerical methods; Trees (mathematics); Data mining","Computer Science Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil",,,,9789898565594,,,"English","ICEIS - Proc.

Therefore, we used the data from the Labor Forum of São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, Brazil, to do the training of various ANNs, the MLR and the Decision Tree. In several simulations, the techniques were used directly and in others, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and / or the coding of attributes were performed before their use in order to further improve their performance. Thus, taking up new data (processes) for which it is necessary to predict the duration of the lawsuit, it will be possible to make up conditions to ""diagnose"" its length preliminarily at its course.

This study aimed to assess the potential of data mining techniques as a tool to associate surface temperature with thermal comfort of horses. TS was obtained using infrared thermography image processing. Physiological and environmental variables were used to define the predicted class, which classified thermal comfort as ""comfort"" and ""discomfort"". The variables of armpit, croup, breast and groin TS of horses and the predicted classes were then subjected to a machine learning process. All variables in the dataset were considered relevant for the classification problem and the decision-tree model yielded an accuracy rate of 74 %. The feature selection methods used to reduce computational cost and simplify predictive learning decreased model accuracy to 70 %; however, the model became simpler with easily interpretable rules. For both these selection methods and for the classification using all attributes, armpit and breast TS had a higher power rating for predicting thermal comfort. Data mining techniques show promise in the discovery of new variables associated with the thermal comfort of horses.","Data mining; Feature selection methods; Infrared thermography; Surface temperature; Thermoregulation",,"Maia, A.

Top-down decision-tree algorithms are of great importance, considering their ability to provide an intuitive and accurate knowledge representation for classification problems. The automatic design of these algorithms seems timely, given the large literature accumulated over more than 40 years of research in the manual design of decision-tree induction algorithms. The proposed hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm, HEAD-DT, is extensively tested using 20 public UCI datasets and 10 microarray gene expression datasets. The algorithms automatically designed by HEAD-DT are compared with traditional decision-tree induction algorithms, such as C4.5 and CART.

In the context of data stream classification, concept drift is considered one of the most difficult and important issues to be addressed. Ensemble classifiers can be successfully applied to data streams as long as the ensemble efficiently adapts itself in the occurrence of a concept drift. SAE algorithm inherits strategies from other ensemble methods, such as Online Bagging [4] and DWM [2], and merge these with the notion of connectivity between similar classifiers w.r.t. their individual predictions. The relational data obtained through measuring similarities between classifiers is used to arrange ensemble members in a social network structure that allows us to identify subgroups (subnetworks) of highly similar classifiers. Being able to identify similar classifiers allows us to implement a combination strategy that first combines predictions within similar classifiers and later combines these into the final prediction. Moreover, this combination strategy assigns more weight to recently added classifiers predictions during concept drifts, since these are dissimilar to all other existing classifiers. The similarity between classifiers is also used to identify and remove redundant classifiers. This effectively saves systems resources and sometimes improves accuracy. We present empirical experiments with synthetic data streams containing abrupt, gradual and no drift showing that SAE is a valid option for stream classification, especially when data stream characteristics (e.g. presence of abrupt drifts) are previously unknown and system resources, such as CPU time and memory space, are a concern. © 2013 IEEE.","concept drift; data stream classification; data stream mining; ensemble classifier","Combination strategies; Concept drifts; Data stream classifications; Data stream mining; Empirical experiments; Ensemble classifiers; Measuring similarities; Social network structures; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Forecasting; Social networking (online); Data mining","Programa de Pós-Graduação em Informática (PPGIA), Pontifícia Universidade Católica Do Paraná (PUCPR), Curitiba, Brazil",,,,9781467358958,,,"English","Proc.

The use of smart meters to automate data collection is set to solve the problem of electricity theft, which is a serious concern in developing nations. Nevertheless, the unlimited use of data from smart meters allows for potentially private information to be discovered. There is a demand for methods to quantify the trade-off between privacy-preservation and quality of a classification model. We describe the research and development of an agent-based simulation platform to evaluate the balance between privacy-preservation mechanisms and methods for electricity theft detection. We have implemented a proof-of-concept model and validated it against real data collected from smart meters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Agent based simulation; Classification models; Developing nations; Electricity theft detection; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving data mining; Private information; Research and development; Data mining; Electric power measurement; Multi agent systems; Smart meters; Smart power grids","Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande Do sul (UFRGS)Brazil",,,03029743,9783642407758,,,"English","Lect.

Examples of such applications are related to bioinformatics, e-commerce, and sensor data. Regarding classification by means of decision trees, some efficient approaches have been proposed, which are centralized and based on restructuring the decision tree using new instances. However, there are some issues. First, most proposed approaches require that new instances are fully labeled. Second, in some environments, the agent in charge of the classification task cannot re-induce the classifier or restructure the decision tree each time it observes a new instance. Moreover, because this agent does not see the whole dataset, the induced classifier is not likely to be very accurate unless information is exchanged among the agents that are, each, in charge of pieces of the data. Thus, a decrease in accuracy may occur because attributes and classes may be misrepresented in the training dataset used so far. Instead of re-inducing the classification model with arbitrary frequency in a centralized way, this paper proposes an approach based on reinforcement learning that allows agents to go on using the existing classifier as basis for some exploration in the space of possible classifications. We use a quality assessment of the learned model in order to let each agent decide when it is time to get a new model, either by borrowing it from another agent, or by inducing a new classifier. Results using UCI datasets with various characteristics show that this method can be used as a compromise between costly methods for re-inducing the classifier at all times, and using only a static and centralized classification model. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Arbitrary frequencies; Classification models; Classification tasks; Data mining and knowledge discovery; Large volumes; On-line fashion; Quality assessment; Training dataset; Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Intelligent agents; Mathematical models; Reinforcement learning; Decision trees","Bazzan, A.L.C.; PPGC/ Instituto de Informática, UFRGS, Caixa Postal 15064, CEP 91501-970, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; email: bazzan@inf.ufrgs.br",,,,9781467358811,,,"English","Proc.

Often research in this context uses concepts of data mining, social network analysis, trust discovery and sentiment analysis. The connected network of people is generally represented by a directed graph (social graph), whose formulation includes representing people as nodes and their relationships as edges, which also can be labeled to describe the relationship (eg. friend, son and girlfriend). This environment of connected nodes behaves like a dynamic network, whose nodes and connections are constantly being updated. People tend to communicate or relate better with other people who have a common or similar way of thinking, which generates groups of people with common interests, the communities. This paper studies the use of a graph clustering approach, the Coring Method, originally employed in image segmentation task, in order to be applied in the context of community discovery on a social network environment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Community Discovery; Data Mining; Graph Clustering; Web-based Social Networks","Common interests; Community discoveries; Connected networks; Dynamic network; Graph clustering; Network environments; Sentiment analysis; Web-based social networks; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Social networking (online)","Department of Computing, Centro Universitário Luterano de Palmas, Av.

These tumors often have an aggressive clinical outcome hallmarked by a propensity for local invasion and regional nodal metastasis. Upregulated genes could be useful as markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and as new drug targets for these tumors. Methods: To identify upregulated genes in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSSCs), we examined the ORESTES public database and used a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) approach to determine the expression level of selected genes in tumor samples. Results and Conclusions: The ORESTES data mining analysis indicated 40 upregulated genes in HNSCC. Nine of these candidate genes were selected for further qRT-PCR validation and 3 of them (ALDOA, AHSA1, and POLQ) were frequently found upregulated in OSCC samples, which may indicate an association of these genes with the carcinogenesis process in this tumor site and they can constitute potential new targets for therapy. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; quantitative RT-PCR; upregulation","complementary DNA; RNA; aged; ahsa1 gene; ALDOA gene; article; cancer genetics; carcinogenesis; clinical article; data mining; DNA synthesis; down regulation; female; gene expression; human; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; polQ gene; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; upregulation; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; quantitative RT-PCR; upregulation; Adult; Aged; Biopsy, Needle; Brazil; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Reference Values; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Neoplasm; Up-Regulation","Vettore, A.L.; Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, UNIFESP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; email: andre.vettore@gmail.com",,,10433074,,HEANE,"22987617","English","Head Neck",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884844883

In order to classify both single and multiple disturbances, the principle of divideand- conquer is employed and a tree structure is constructed by means of simple classifiers: Perceptrons and a Bayesian classifier. Aiming at reducing its computational cost, only six parameters extracted from the filtered electrical signal are used by the final classifier. Such parameters are the secondorder cumulants and the RMS value.

But what do such values mean? What is the realworld semantics behind these attributes and their values? An approach to improve the semantics of conceptual modeling languages is to ground them on ontological theories. Following this strategy, over the last decade, the foundational ontology UFO has been applied to create the OntoUML modeling language, an ontologically well founded version of UML. In the current work we present extensions to UFO in order to improve the ontological foundations concerning value spaces by employing the notion Semantic Reference Spaces. A concrete application of this theory is presented, applying the proposed UFO extensions to ground an ontologically founded version of (Onto)UML Datatype classes.

The difficulty of scaling a search to large datasets explains to a great extent why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following unintuitive fact: in large datasets we can exactly search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We explain how our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. Moreover, we show how our ideas allow us to efficiently support the uniform scaling distance measure, a measure whose utility seems to be underappreciated, but which we demonstrate here. In addition to mining massive datasets with up to one trillion data points, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible. © 2013 ACM.","Lower bounds; Similarity search; Time series","Dynamic time warping; Euclidean distance; Lower bounds; Real time monitoring; Similarity search; Time series data mining; Time series subsequences; Time-series experiments; Algorithms; Time series; Time series analysis; Data mining","Rakthanmanon, T.; Department of Computer Engineering, University of California RiversideUnited States; email: thanawin.r@ku.ac.th",,,15564681,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

Animal vocalization analysis is a noninvasive procedure and may be used as a tool for assessing animal welfare status. The objective of this research was to identify stress conditions in piglets reared in farrowing pens through their vocalization. Vocal signals were collected from 40 animals under the following situations: normal (baseline), feeling cold, in pain, and feeling hunger. A unidirectional microphone positioned about 15 cm from the animals' mouth was used for recording the acoustic signals. The microphone was connected to a digital recorder, where the signals were digitized at the 44,100 Hz frequency. The collected sounds were edited and analyzed. The J48 decision tree algorithm available at the Weka® data mining software was used for stress classification. It was possible to categorize diverse conditions from the piglets' vocalization during the farrowing phase (pain, cold and hunger), with an accuracy rate of 81.12%. Results indicated that vocalization might be an effective welfare indicator, and it could be applied for assessing distress from pain, cold and hunger in farrowing piglets. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Animal welfare; Classification algorithm; Pig farming; Sound signals",,"Nääs, I.

Diversity and quality are claimed to be critical for the selection of the partitions to be combined. To enhance these characteristics, methods can be applied to evaluate and select a subset of the partitions that provide ensemble results similar or better than those based on the full set of partitions. Previous studies have shown that this selection can significantly improve the quality of the final partitions. For such, an appropriate evaluation of the candidate partitions to be combined must be performed. In this work, several methods to evaluate and select partitions are investigated, most of them based on relative clustering validity indexes. These indexes select the partitions with the highest quality to participate in the ensemble. However, each relative index can be more suitable for particular data conformations. Thus, distinct relative indexes are combined to create a final evaluation that tends to be robust to changes in the application scenario, as the majority of the combined indexes may compensate the poor performance of some individual indexes. We also investigate the impact of the diversity among partitions used for the ensemble. A comparative evaluation of results obtained from an extensive collection of experiments involving state-of-the-art methods and statistical tests is presented. Based on the obtained results, a practical design approach is proposed to support cluster ensemble selection. This approach was successfully applied to real public domain data sets. © 2012 The Author(s).","Cluster ensemble selection; Combination; Diversity; Evaluation; Relative validity indexes","Cluster ensembles; Combination; Diversity; Evaluation; Validity index; Computer applications; Data mining; Statistical tests","Naldi, M.C.; Federal University of Viçosa-UFV, Post Box 22, Rio Paranaíba, MG CEP 38.810-000, Brazil; email: murilocn@ufv.br",,,13845810,,,,"English","Data Min.

These criteria are endowed with particular features that may make each of them more suitable for specific classes of problems. Nevertheless, the performance of each criterion is usually unknown a priori by the user. Hence, choosing a specific criterion is not a trivial task. A possible approach to circumvent this drawback consists of combining different relative criteria in order to obtain more robust evaluations. However, this approach has so far been applied in an ad-hoc fashion only; its real potential is actually not well-understood. In this paper, we present an extensive study on the combination of relative criteria considering both synthetic and real datasets. The experiments involved 28 criteria and 4 different combination strategies applied to a varied collection of data partitions produced by 5 clustering algorithms. In total, 427,680 partitions of 972 synthetic datasets and 14,000 partitions of a collection of 400 image datasets were considered. Based on the results, we discuss the shortcomings and possible benefits of combining different relative criteria into a committee.

In this context, this paper aims to propose an adaptation of a bee-inspired optimization algorithm so that it is able to solve data clustering problems.

The learning algorithms strongly rely on the algorithm employed for constructing the graph from input data, given as a set of vector-based patterns. A popular way to build such graphs is to treat each data pattern as a vertex; vertices are then connected according to some similarity measure, resulting in an structure known as data graph. In this paper we propose a new type of data graph, focused on data attributes, named Attribute-based Decision Graph-AbDG, suitable for supervised multiclass classification tasks. The input data for constructing an AbDG is a set of data-vectors (patterns), that can be described by either type of attributes (numeric, categorical or both). Also, algorithms for constructing such graphs and using them in classification tasks are described. An AbDG can be associated to a classifying procedure approached as a graph matching process, where the sub-graph representing a new pattern is matched against the AbDG. The proposed approach has been experimentally evaluated on classification tasks in twenty knowledge domains and the results are competitive when compared to those of two well-known classification methods (C4.5 and Multi-Interval ID3). © 2013 IEEE.","Attribute-based decision graphs; Data graph construction; Decision graphs; Graph-based classification; Multi-class classification","Classification methods; Classification tasks; Data graph; Data mining algorithm; Decision graphs; Graph-based classifications; Graph-based representations; Multi-class classification; Graphic methods; Input output programs; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern matching; Data mining","CS Dept., ICMC, University of S.

Numerous methods for dealing with this problem are based on decomposition, which essentially treats labels (or some subsets of labels) independently and ignores interactions between them. This fact might be a problem, as some labels may be correlated to local patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose to enhance multi-label classifiers with the aid of biclusters, which are capable of finding the correlation between subsets of objects, features and labels.

Each instance in HMC can be classified into two or more classes simultaneously. These classes are structured in a hierarchy, in the form of either a tree or a directed acyclic graph. Therefore, an instance can be assigned to two or more paths from the hierarchical structure, resulting in a complex classification problem with hundreds or thousands of classes. Several methods have been proposed to deal with such problems, including several algorithms based on well-known bio-inspired techniques, such as neural networks, ant colony optimization, and genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel global method called GEHM, which makes use of grammatical evolution for generating HMC rules. In this approach, the grammatical evolution algorithm evolves the antecedents of classification rules, in order to assign instances from a HMC dataset to a probabilistic class vector. Our method is compared to bio-inspired HMC algorithms in protein function prediction datasets. The empirical analysis conducted in this work shows that GEHM outperforms the bio-inspired algorithms with statistical significance, which suggests that grammatical evolution is a promising alternative to deal with hierarchical multi-label classification of biological data. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Bio-inspired algorithms; Bio-inspired techniques; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Grammatical evolution; Hierarchical multi-label classifications; Hierarchical structures; Protein function prediction; Statistical significance; Classification (of information); Computational grammars; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms","Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil",,,,9781479904549,,,"English","IEEE Congr.

The obvious solution to this problem is the application of semisupervised learning; however, as we shall show, direct applications of off-The-shelf semi-supervised learning algorithms do not typically work well for time series.

From 2013 onwards, a new generation of land remote sensing satellites from USA, China, Brazil, India and Europe will produce in 1. year as much data as 5 years of the Landsat-7 satellite. Thus, the research community needs new ways to analyze large data sets of remote sensing imagery. To address this need, this paper describes a toolbox for combing land remote sensing image analysis with data mining techniques. Data mining methods are being extensively used for statistical analysis, but up to now have had limited use in remote sensing image interpretation due to the lack of appropriate tools. The toolbox described in this paper is the Geographic Data Mining Analyst (GeoDMA). It has algorithms for segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, landscape metrics and multi-temporal methods for change detection and analysis. GeoDMA uses decision-tree strategies adapted for spatial data mining. It connects remotely sensed imagery with other geographic data types using access to local or remote database. GeoDMA has methods to assess the accuracy of simulation models, as well as tools for spatio-temporal analysis, including a visualization of time-series that helps users to find patterns in cyclic events. The software includes a new approach for analyzing spatio-temporal data based on polar coordinates transformation. This method creates a set of descriptive features that improves the classification accuracy of multi-temporal image databases. GeoDMA is tightly integrated with TerraView GIS, so its users have access to all traditional GIS features. To demonstrate GeoDMA, we show two case studies on land use and land cover change. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Image processing; Image segmentation; Landscape ecology; Multitemporal analysis; OBIA","Land use and land cover change; Landscape ecology; Multi-temporal analysis; OBIA; Remote sensing image interpretations; Remote sensing satellites; Remotely sensed imagery; Spatiotemporal analysis; Computer simulation; Feature extraction; Geographic information systems; Image analysis; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Metadata; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Data mining; algorithm; data mining; data set; database; GIS; image analysis; Landsat; landscape ecology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; segmentation; software; visualization; Brazil; China; Europe; India; United States","Körting, T.S.; Image Processing Division - DPI, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, INPE, São José dos Campos, Brazil; email: tkorting@dpi.inpe.br",,,00983004,,CGEOD,,"English","Comput.

This paper proposes a graph-based algorithm which uses the purity measure to help spreading the labels throughout the graph. The purity measure determines how intertwined are different subspaces of data regarding its classes. As high values of purity indicate low mixture among patterns of different classes, its maximization helps finding well-separated connected subgraphs; which facilitates the label spreading process.

This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility datamanagement, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i) constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics, in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects.

In this work, we propose an innovative approach for the classification of meteorological data based on the frequency of occurrence of the values of different variables provided by a weather forecast model. It is possible to identify patterns that may be associated to severe convective activity. In the considered classification problem, the information attributes are variables outputted by the weather forecast model Eta, while the decision attribute is given by the density of occurrence of cloud-to-ground atmospheric electrical discharges, assumed as correlated to the level of convective activity. Results show good classification performance for some selected mini-regions of Brazil during the summer of 2007. We expect that the screening of the outputs of the meteorological model Eta by the proposed classifier could serve as a support tool for meteorologists in order to identify in advance patterns associated to severe convective events. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Clustering; Convective events; Data mining; Frequency of occurrence; Weather forecast","Atmospheric electrical discharges; Classification approach; Classification performance; Clustering; Convective events; Frequency of occurrence; Spatial and temporal scale; Weather forecasts; Classification (of information); Data mining; Electric discharges; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Damage detection; atmospheric electricity; convective system; data mining; meteorology; severe weather; weather forecasting; Brazil","Teixeira de Lima, G.R.; Laboratório Associado de Computação e Matemática Aplicada (LAC), Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), Av. dos Astronautas 1758, Jardim da Granja CEP 12227-010, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil; email: glau11@gmail.com",,,00983004,,CGEOD,,"English","Comput.

The purpose of this study was to (1) generate a digital pedological map using data mining techniques to associate geomorphometric and geology variables with soil classes of traditional soil maps in reference areas and (2) validate these maps by different field techniques. The mapping was carried out using the 1:50.000 Botucatu sheet (SF-22-Z-B-VI-3), and 1:50.000 Dois Córregos and São Pedro sheets (São Paulo, Brazil) as reference areas. Training data - soil mapping units (MU) and topographic and geological variables from the reference areas were analyzed by PART, a decision-tree algorithm found on the Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software, producing classification rules, which were applied to the Botucatu sheet. Field validation of the produced digital maps was carried out by transect sampling in the zone of São Pedro and by a stratified-random sampling procedure at Botucatu sheet. Accuracy of the mapping unit at São Pedro was 83 %, for the digital and 66 %, for the traditional soil map with simplified legend. Although analysis generated rules for all MU's of the training areas, not all MU's were predicted on the Botucatu sheet, due to differences in relief and geology between training and mapping areas. Digital soil map of Botucatu had an overall accuracy of 52 %, consistent with reconnaissance soil surveys of low intensity, and a kappa index of 0.41, indicating good quality. Larger mapping units on training areas produced more rules, thus reproducing more accurately soil-landscape pattern of the mapped area Validation at the São Pedro sheet by transect sampling suggested that the digital map is cconsistent to high intensity reconnaissance soil surveys; whereas the traditional map (simplified legend) quality corresponded to that of low-intensity soil surveys. Training of the algorithm on maps, not in field-observed points, reduced accuracy of digital soil map by 14 %. Latin hypercube sampling is adequate for mapping areas with large data bases, allows to evaluate the entire mapped area and imparts efficiency to field work. Transect sampling is adequate to evaluate purity of individual mapping units, requires no detailed data base of predictor variables, and allows studies on soil-landscape relationships in pedosequences.","Data mining; Latin hypercube sampling; Quality of soil class maps; Reconnaissance soil surveys; Soil-landscape relationship modeling; Transect sampling",,,,,01000683,,,,"English; Portuguese","Rev.

In this work, an approach is presented for the integration of medical reports in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Reporting standard in telemedicine networks using structured vocabularies. Materials and Methods: The use of these structured vocabularies is extended beyond radiology, and a case study in telecardiology is presented. The approach was applied in the context of a real-world statewide public telemedicine network; nowadays on average 470 written electrocardiographic structured reports daily are being performed. Cardiologists provided more than 220,000 written structured reports, and these reports are stored into a central database. Results: This study was performed during a 12-month period, and it was possible to examine possible associations between a list of co-morbidities and cardiac risk factors with a diagnosis that indicates the presence of cardiac ischemia, cardiac injury, or possible necrosis by using DICOM Structured Reporting. Our application is responsible for coordinating the process of issuance of reports through various technologies and devices. The system works as a library in an HTTP server, which accesses information from studies in DICOM format from the database and from structured vocabularies. Conclusions: Results indicate that traceability of morbidity, diagnoses, and patient clinical information can be achieved, resulting in an efficient data mining-friendly framework. A multidevice application for Web-based and smartphone-based platforms showed that it is a viable solution for applying the DICOM Structured Reporting standard in telemedicine networks. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","computing methodologies; information storage and retrieval; medical informatics; public health","Data mining; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Diseases; Health risks; HTTP; Medical computing; Medical imaging; mHealth; Public health; Smartphones; Telemedicine; Clinical information; Computing methodologies; Information storage and retrieval; Medical informatics; Structured reporting; Structured reports; Telemedicine networks; Various technologies; Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM); Brazil; cardiology; computer network; controlled vocabulary; electrocardiography; hospital information system; medical record; nomenclature; organization and management; program development; public health; standards; system analysis; telecommunication; telemedicine; Brazil; Cardiology; Computer Communication Networks; Electrocardiography; Medical Records; Program Development; Public Health; Radiology Information Systems; Systems Integration; Telecommunications; Telemedicine; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled","Von Wangenheim, A.; Departamento de Informática e Estatística, Sala 320, Campus Joaõo David Ferreira Lima-Trindade, Florianópolis, SC, 88040-970, Brazil; email: awangenh@inf.ufsc.br",,"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",15305627,,TJEOA,"23837517","English","Telemedicine. e-Health",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899775279

Among these models, the Decision Tree (DT) technique has been increasingly applied due to its capacity of dealing with large datasets. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the data volume used to generate the DT models on the quality of soil maps. An area of 889.33 km2 was chosen in the Northern region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The soil-landscape relationship was obtained from reambulation of the studied area and the alignment of the units in the 1:50,000 scale topographic mapping. Six predictive covariates linked to the factors soil formation, relief and organisms, together with data sets of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % of the total data volume, were used to generate the predictive DT models in the data mining program Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). In this study, sample densities below 5 % resulted in models with lower power of capturing the complexity of the spatial distribution of the soil in the study area. The relation between the data volume to be handled and the predictive capacity of the models was best for samples between 5 and 15 %. For the models based on these sample densities, the collected field data indicated an accuracy of predictive mapping close to 70 %.","Decision tree; Mapping unit; Pedometry; Soil survey",,"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Curitibanos - Rod.

The amount of carbon stored in this carbon pool is estimated by using either allometric equations or biomass expansion factors. Both of the methods provide estimate of the carbon stock based on the biometric parameters of a model tree. This study calls attention to the potential advantages of the data mining technique known as instance-based classification, which is not used currently for this purpose. The analysis of the data on the carbon storage in 30 trees of Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia) shows that the instance-based classification provides as relevant estimates as the conventional methods do. The coefficient of correlation between the estimated and measured values of carbon storage in tree biomass does not vary significantly with the choice of the method. The use of some other measures of method performance leads to the same result. In contrast to the convention methods the instance-based classification does not presume any specific form of the function relating carbon storage to the biometric parameters of the tree. Since the best form of such function is difficult to find, the instance-based classification could outperform the conventional methods in some cases, or simply get rid of the questions about the choice of the allometric equations. © 2013 Sanquetta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biomass; Biomass expansion factor; Euclidean distance; Regression equations; Root-to-shoot ratio","allometry; biometry; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; classification; coniferous tree; data mining; estimation method; management practice; root-shoot ratio; tree; Brazil","Corte, A.P.D.; Department of Forest Science, Federal University of Paraná, Rua Simão Brante, 103, sob. 5, Uberaba, Curitiba, Paraná 81.570-340, Brazil; email: anapaulacorte@gmail.com",,,17500680,,,,"English","Carbon Balance Manage.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879539977

Many visualization techniques, such as similarity based point placement layouts, have proved useful to support visual analysis of documents. However, they are sensitive to data quality, which, in turn, relies on a critical preprocessing step that involves text cleaning and in some cases term detecting and weighting, as well as the definition of a similarity function. Not much has been discussed on the effect of these important similarity calculations in the quality of visual representations. This paper presents a study on the role of different text similarity measurements on the generation of visual text mappings. We focus mainly on two types of distance functions, those based on the well-known text vector representation and on direct string comparison measurements, comparing their effect on visual mappings obtained with point placement techniques. We find that both have their value but, in many circumstances, the vector space model (VSM) is the best solution when discrimination is important. However, the VSM is not incremental, that is, new additions to a collection force a recalculation of the whole feature space and similarities. In this work we also propose a new incremental model based on the VSM, which is shown to present the best visualization results in many configurations tested. We show the evaluation results and offer recommendations on the application of different text similarity measurements for Visual Text Analytics tasks.","High-dimensional data visualization and multidimensional projections; Vector space model; Visual text analytics; Visual text mining","High dimensional data; Similarity calculation; Text analytics; Text mining; Vector representations; Vector space models; Visual representations; Visualization technique; Data mining; Data visualization; Information science; Information systems; Vector spaces; Mapping","Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Brazil",,,,9789898565464,,,"English","GRAPP IVAPP - Proc.

In this context, data is individually represented as a feature vector. This data has a natural nonrelational structure, but can be represented in a relational form through similarity-based network models. In these models, examples are represented by vertices and an edge connects two examples with high similarity. This relational representation allows employing network-based algorithms in Relational Data Mining. Specifically in clustering tasks, these models allow to use community detection algorithms in networks in order to detect data clusters. In this work, we compared traditional non-relational data-based clustering algorithms with clustering detection algorithms based on relational data using measures for community detection in networks. We carried out an exploratory analysis over 23 numerical datasets and 10 textual datasets. Results show that network models can efficiently represent the data topology, allowing their application in cluster detection with higher precision when compared to non-relational methods.

How it is a way impossible to test all available compounds for a target receptor, there is a need to select the most promising. One possible approach for such selection is to consider characteristics like a set of molecular properties called molecular descriptors. Aiming at describing these characteristics, we introduce a Data Warehouse (DW) model that integrates molecular descriptors from different public databases of compounds, as well as relates them with Virtual Screening (VS) experiments data. With the proposed DW we are able to produce proper data sets for classification mining experiments. We performed a case study with a VS considering as receptor the HIV-1 Protease receptor and 76 compounds. The data sets produced from our DW are composed by 7 molecular descriptors as the predictive attributes, and as a target attribute the discretized Free Energy of Binding (FEB) value between the ligands and the target receptor. By performing C4.5 algorithm over the generated data sets, we got decision-trees models that indicates which molecular descriptors and their respective values are relevant to influence on good FEB results.

However, recent attempts to find effective substitutes to combat infections have been directed at identifying natural antimicrobial peptides in order to circumvent resistance to commercial antibiotics. This study describes the development of synthetic peptides with antimicrobial activity, created in silico by site-directed mutation modeling using wild-type peptides as scaffolds for these mutations. Fragments of antimicrobial peptides were used for modeling with molecular modeling computational tools. To analyze these peptides, a decision tree model, which indicated the action range of peptides on the types of microorganisms on which they can exercise biological activity, was created. The decision tree model was processed using physicochemistry properties from known antimicrobial peptides available at the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD). The two most promising peptides were synthesized, and antimicrobial assays showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The data modeling process corresponds to a set of conceptual tools to describe data, its relationships, its semantics, and constraints of consistency. This process involves the steps related to the identification of requisites, conceptual modeling of data, conventional modeling, and non-conventional modeling of objects, and its relationships. In the conceptual modeling, where there is no need to specify the methods and data flow, objects and their relationships are defined. In conventional modeling, in the mapping of the conceptual model (Entity/Relationship) to the logical model (Relational) conversion rules are applied. However, there are non-conventional resources with the ability to create and use data types based on a grouping of other data types. The user-defined objects can be defined and used like any other data type.

In contrast, how tobacco smoke affects embryonic development remains poorly understood. Morphological studies of the fetuses of smoking pregnant women have shown various physical deformities induced by constant fetal exposure to tobacco components, especially nicotine. In addition, nicotine exposure decreases fetal body weight and bone/cartilage growth in addition to decreasing cranial diameter and tibia length. Unfortunately, the molecular pathways leading to these morphological anomalies are not completely understood. In this study, we applied interactome data mining tools and small compound interaction networks to elucidate possible molecular pathways associated with the effects of tobacco smoke components during embryonic development in pregnant female smokers. Our analysis showed a relationship between nicotine and 50 additional harmful substances involved in a variety of biological process that can cause abnormal proliferation, impaired cell differentiation, and increased oxidative stress. We also describe how nicotine can negatively affect retinoic acid signaling and cell differentiation through inhibition of retinoic acid receptors. In addition, nicotine causes a stress reaction and/or a pro-inflammatory response that inhibits the agonistic action of retinoic acid.

More recently, software quality has received attention from researchers due to the importance that software has gained in supporting all levels of the organizations. New methods, techniques, and tools were created to increase the quality and productivity of the software development process. Approaches based on the practitioners' experience, for example, or on the analysis of the data generated during the development process, have been adopted. This paper follows the second path by applying data mining procedures to figure out variables from the development process that most affect the software quality. The premise is that the quality of decision making in management of software projects is closely related to information gathered during the development process. A case study is presented in which some regression models were built to explore this idea during the phases of testing, approval, and production. The results can be applied, mainly, to help the development managers in focusing those variables to improve the quality of the software as a final product. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Data mining; Regression models; Software quality","Development process; Management of software projects; Regression model; Software development process; Software Quality; Data mining; Decision making; Knowledge engineering; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Software engineering; Computer software selection and evaluation","Do Prado, H.A.; Graduate Program on Knowledge and IT Management, Catholic University of Brasilia, SGAN 916 Av.

This fact led to the development of many approaches to select the candidates that best fit into the requirements of a certain position. However, defining what are the most important features that condition a good personnel performance is still a problem. In this paper, we discuss an approach, based on data mining techniques, to help managers in this process. We built a classifier, based in the Combinatorial Neural Model (CNM), taking as dependent variable the performance of managers as observed along their careers. As independent variables, we considered the results of wellknown psychological tests (MBTI and DISC). The rules generated by CNM enabled the arising of interesting relations between the psychological profile of managers in their start point in the company and the quality of their work after some years in action. These rules are expected to support the improvement of the selection process by driving the choice of candidates to those with a best prospective. Also, the adequate allocation of people - the right professional in the right place - shall be improved. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Combinatorial Neural Model; Knowledge-Based Systems; Performance Management; Psychological Evaluation","Dependent variables; Important features; Independent variables; Neural models; Performance management; Psychological evaluation; Psychological tests; Start point; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Learning systems; Managers; Testing; Management","Ferneda, E.; Graduate Program in Knowledge Management and IT, Catholic University of Brasilia, SGAN 916 - Módulo B, 70.790-160, DF Brasília, DF, Brazil; email: eferneda@pos.ucb.br",,,03029743,9783642373428,,,"English","Lect.

It has several important practical and academic applications. For this reason, having computational tools capable of analyzing bathymetric charts would be useful for domain experts studying the various problems related to water depth. Data mining is a well known technique for extracting information from large datasets, but cannot be directly applied to images. The contribution of this work is an approach for using data mining in bathymetry images. We propose a method for processing input images, in order to extract records and their features, which can be processed by classic data mining algorithms. Additionally, we also propose techniques to visualize both data mining results and map characteristics.

CDV has been implemented in verification testbenches using supervised learning techniques to model the relationship between coverage events and stimuli generation, providing a feedback between them. One commonly used technique is the classification- or decision-tree data mining, which has shown to be appropriate due to the easy modeling. Learning techniques are applied in two steps: training and application. Training is made on one or more sets of examples, which relate datasets to pre-determined classes. Precision of results by applying the predictive learning concept has shown to be sensitive to the size of the training set and the amount of imbalance of associated classes, this last meaning the number of datasets associated to each class is very different from each other. This work presents experiments on the manipulation of data mining training sets, by changing the size and reducing the imbalances, in order to check their influence on the CDV efficiency. To do that, a circuit example with a large input space and strong class imbalance was selected from the application domain of multimedia systems and another one, with a small input space that affects the coverage occurrences, was selected from the communication area. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification-tree; Coverage driven verification; Data mining; Decision-tree; Functional verification; Training set","Class imbalance; Classification-tree; Communication area; Constant pressures; Coverage-driven verifications; Functional verification; Learning techniques; Training sets; Data mining; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Multimedia systems; Software architecture; Learning systems; Algorithms; Data Processing; Decision Making; Forestry; Set","Chau, W.J.; School of Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

It was applied a data mining technique, clustering (grouping of data), by using the k-means algorithm for transforming time series of precipitation in five rainfall homogeneous areas, in response to topography, maritime dimension, and weather systems operating in the region of study. Data of average monthly rainfall of 92 meteorological stations were used. The results indicate that the driest areas are situated in the central part of the state, from north to south, mainly in the north with the lowest annual volumes, around 480 mm. The area located in the north of the state contrasts with that one located on the coast, where the largest volumes of annual rainfall of the study were observed (approximately 1.380 mm). The high rainfall variability occurs in almost all areas, especially in two of those of semiarid ones with Coefficients of Variation (CV) reaching 42 and 28%. This characteristic differs from the area belonging to the coastal area, which presents regular rainfall during all the year and a CV of 15%. The rainy and dry seasons are well defined. Precipitation values of the rainy season accounts for about 81% of the annual total, with emphasis on the zones located in the central-west and west of the state with 95 and 96% of the annual total.","Clustering; Data mining; Rainfall variability","algorithm; data mining; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; temporal analysis; time series; topographic effect; Bahia; Brazil","Dourado, C.

In this paper, a network-based (graph-based) semi-supervised learning method is proposed. It is based on competition and cooperation among walking particles in a network to uncover overlapping nodes by generating continuous-valued outputs (soft labels), corresponding to the levels of membership from the nodes to each of the communities. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to detect overlapping data items in a data set of general form, such as a vector-based data set, once it is transformed to a network. Usually, label propagation involves risks of error amplification. In order to avoid this problem, the proposed method offers a mechanism to identify outliers among the labeled data items, and consequently prevents error propagation from such outliers.

Load signature extraction is different from load activity identification. It is a new and important problem to solve for the applications of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). For a target appliance whose signatures are to be extracted, the proposed technique first selects the candidate events that are likely to be associated with the appliance by using generic signatures and an event filtration step. It then applies a clustering algorithm to identify the authentic events of this appliance. In the third step, the operation cycles of appliances are estimated using an association algorithm. Finally, the electric signatures are extracted from these operation cycles. The results can have various applications. One is to create signature databases for the NILM applications. Another is for load condition monitoring. Validation results based on the data collected from three actual houses and a laboratory experiment have shown that the proposed method is a promising solution to the problem of load signature collection. © 2013 IEEE.","Clustering; data mining; load signature; non-intrusive load monitoring","Association algorithms; Clustering; Laboratory experiments; Nonintrusive load monitoring; Residential loads; Signature database; Signature extraction; Validation results; Clustering algorithms; Condition monitoring; Data mining; Extraction; Electric appliances","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada",,,19493053,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

This study presents a method for monitoring flood extent variation using ALOS ScanSAR images, tested at the Curuai Lake floodplain, in the lower Amazon River, Brazil. Twelve ScanSAR scenes were acquired between 2006 and 2010, including seven during the 2007 hydrological year. Water level records, field photographs, optical images (Landsat-5/TM and MODIS/Terra and Aqua) and topographic data were used as auxiliary information. A data mining algorithm allowed the implementation of a hierarchical, object-based classification algorithm, able to map land cover types and flooding status in the study area for all available dates. Land cover based on the entire time series (classification levels 1 and 2) had overall accuracies of 90% and 83%, respectively. Level 3 classifications (one map per image date) were validated only for the lowest and highest water stages, with overall accuracies of 76% and 78%, respectively. Total flood extent (Level 4) was mapped with 84% and 94% accuracies, for the low and high water stages, respectively. Regression models were fitted between mapped flooded area and water levels at the Curuai gauge to predict flood extent. A polynomial model had R2=0.95 (p&lt;0.05) and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 241km2, while a logistic model had R2=0.98 (p&lt;0.05) and RMSE=127km2. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Incidence angle; Kyoto & Carbon Initiative; Multi-temporal analysis; Object-based image analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands","ALOS/PALSAR; Amazon basin; Amazon river; Auxiliary information; Classification algorithm; Cloud cover; Data mining algorithm; Flood plains; Flooded areas; High water; Hydrological years; Image dates; Incidence angles; Land cover; Land-cover types; Landsat-5; Level 4; Logistic models; Multi-temporal analysis; Multi-temporal SAR; Object based; Object based image analysis; Optical image; Polynomial models; Regression model; Root mean square errors; Scansar; Seasonal variation; Study areas; Topographic data; Algorithms; Banks (bodies of water); Carbon; Data mining; Geometrical optics; Mean square error; Photography; Regression analysis; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Wetlands; Floods; algorithm; ALOS; floodplain; Kyoto Protocol; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; synthetic aperture radar; water level; wetland; Amazon River","Arnesen, A.S.; Divisão de Sensoriamento Remoto, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, Caixa Postal 515, 12201-970, São José dos Campos, Brazil; email: allansarnesen@gmail.com",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

We design the pattern domain of multi-dimensional association rules, i.e., non trivial extensions of the popular association rules that may involve subsets of any dimensions in their antecedents and their consequents. First, we design new objective interestingness measures for such rules and it leads to different approaches for measuring the rule confidence. Second, we must compute collections of a priori interesting rules. It is considered here as a post-processing of the closed patterns that can be extracted efficiently from Boolean tensors.

Malignant brain neoplasms are among the most devastating and incurable forms of cancer, and their treatment may be excessively complex and costly. Public health decision makers require significant amounts of analytical information to manage public treatment programs for these patients. Data mining, a technology that is used to produce analytically useful information, has been employed successfully with medical data. However, the large-scale adoption of this technique has been limited thus far because it is difficult to use, especially for non-expert users. One way to facilitate data mining by non-expert users is to automate the process. Our aim is to present an automated data mining system that allows public health decision makers to access analytical information regarding brain tumors. The emphasis in this study is the use of ontology in an automated data mining process. The non-experts who tried the system obtained useful information about the treatment of brain tumors.

Imputation algorithms have been traditionally compared in terms of the similarity between imputed and original values. However, this traditional approach, sometimes referred to as prediction ability, does not allow inferring the influence of imputed values in the ultimate modeling tasks (e.g., in classification). Based on an extensive experimental work, we study the influence of five nearest-neighbor based imputation algorithms (KNNImpute, SKNN, IKNNImpute, KMI and EACImpute) and two simple algorithms widely used in practice (Mean Imputation and Majority Method) on classification problems. In order to experimentally assess these algorithms, simulations of missing values were performed on six datasets by means of two missingness mechanisms: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR). The latter allows the probabilities of missingness to depend on observed data but not on missing data, whereas the former occurs when the distribution of missingness does not depend on the observed data either. The quality of the imputed values is assessed by two measures: prediction ability and classification bias. Experimental results show that IKNNImpute outperforms the other algorithms in the MCAR mechanism. KNNImpute, SKNN and EACImpute, by their turn, provided the best results in the MAR mechanism. Finally, our experiments also show that best prediction results (in terms of mean squared errors) do not necessarily yield to less classification bias. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article describes the systematization of recurrent NPD management problems. The main NPD problems were found to be recurrent; hence, the systematization resulting from this study allows for the identification of NPD areas requiring special attention from both practitioners and researchers. This identification enables researchers to define new areas of academic research, and practitioners to focus on specific improvement projects. Eight case studies were conducted, in which 124 NPD personnel were interviewed, involving the diagnosis of the NPD process and the identification and selection of NPD improvement projects. The diagnostic method applied was the Current Reality Tree (CRT), which is a cognitive method for identifying undesirable effects (problems) in a process. Text mining techniques were then applied to identify similarities among these CRTs. Lastly, NPD categories were created to classify the NPD problems. An analysis of the rate of problems per category underlined the importance of diagnosing the NPD process. It was concluded that process and project management are just as critical as product strategy definition and human resource management. Additionally, we concluded that companies would gain greater benefits by focusing on the aforementioned areas before investing in information and communication technology. Potential pitfalls of NPD may be avoided if companies adopt proactive management actions to mitigate their NPD recurrent problems based on the results presented here. © 2013 by the American Society for Engineering Management.","Current reality tree; Diagnosis method; New product development; Process improvement","Data mining; Human resource management; Personnel selection; Project management; Diagnosis methods; Diagnostic methods; Information and Communication Technologies; New product development; Proactive management; Process Improvement; Text mining techniques; Undesirable effects; Product development","Costa, J.M.H.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering System Division, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E38-674, Cambridge, MA, 02139, United Kingdom; email: jmcosta@mit.edu",,,10429247,,,,"English","EMJ Eng Manage J",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878211546

Location: Brazilian rain forest. Methods: We compiled and filtered records of 14 animal species that belong to distantly related groups (spiders, harvestmen, scorpions, amphibians, birds, lizards and mammals) and show distinct distribution patterns within the Atlantic rain forest. Using MAXENT, we generated three distribution models for each species under different climatic scenarios (current, 6000 and 21,000 years ago). Species-specific historically stable areas (refugia) were identified through the intersection of the three models. We then measured the amount of 'inclusion' of species-specific refugia within published forest refugia, and quantified 'filling' of the biome refugia by species-specific refugia. The influence of taxonomic distance between species and range descriptors were analysed. Results: Current distribution models generated for the 14 species had high accuracy (AUC > 0.9). Inclusion and filling, two uncorrelated metrics, varied among species and were not influenced by taxonomic identity. Species range characteristics influenced forest model filling only, with higher values found in widely distributed species (i.e. occurring from Northeastern to Southeastern Brazil). Main conclusions: Species-specific and forest refugial areas are not necessarily the same. The power of forest refugial models to predict species-specific refugial area differs among species and may be influenced by range attributes. Species data suggests the existence of a large refugium in Southeast of Brazil, a result at odds with the currently available forest-wide models. The predictive power of forest refugial models is narrowed; we now better understand their applicability limits. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atlantic rain forest; Conservation biogeography; MAXENT; Paleoclimate modelling; Pleistocene and refugium","animal; biodiversity; biogeography; biome; conservation; data mining; habitat; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Quaternary; rainforest; refugium; taxonomy; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Amphibia; Animalia; Araneae; Aves; Mammalia; Opiliones; Scorpiones; Squamata","Porto, T.J.; Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo, 147,Campus Universitario de Ondina, 40170115 Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; email: tjporto@ufba.br",,,13669516,,DIDIF,,"English","Diversity Distrib.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874212841

Although the FCM has shown good performance in detecting clusters, the membership values for each individual computed to each of the clusters cannot indicate how well the individuals are classified. In this paper, a new approach to handle the memberships based on the inherent information in each feature is presented. The algorithm produces a membership matrix for each individual, the membership values are between zero and one and measure the similarity of this individual to the center of each cluster according to each feature. These values can change at each iteration of the algorithm and they are different from one feature to another and from one cluster to another in order to increase the performance of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. To obtain a fuzzy partition by class of the input data set, a way to compute the class membership values is also proposed in this work. Experiments with synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed approach produces good quality of clustering.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These systems generate and store in database huge amount of data representing the history of plant operation. A proper treatment of such historical data may discover relationships and patterns and thus help in the understanding of many important operational aspects and to evaluate the performance of the hydroelectric power plant. The process of Knowledge Discovery in Database (Knowledge Discovery in Database - KDD) is the process of identification in large data sets, patterns that are valid, new, useful and understandable to improve the understanding of a problem or a decisionmaking procedure. The Data Mining (or Data Mining) is the step within KDD that extracts useful information from large databases. In this scenario, the present study is to perform experiments data mining on data generated by SCADA systems for power plant, to produce relevant information to assist in planning, operation, maintenance and safety of dams and implementation of the culture of mining data applied to these plants. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This method is fast and efficient and is not a particularly recent approach, and it is applicable to statistics, economics, engineering, disease studies in medicine, and other fields. The data are stored electronically, and the search is computerized. Although data mining is still evolving, many areas of study are already using this important resource. In molecular biology, for example, the discovery of molecular markers, such as microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, or SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using this approach has increased over the last decade in several organisms, such as plants, clams, shrimp and humans. These markers are even more useful when located in expressed regions of the genome, which are known as expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Characterizing EST-SSRs and EST-SNPs that may be applicable to genetic studies of economically relevant and threatened species is a useful tool for polymorphism analysis, genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL) identification. To identify these markers, owning an EST database (DB) that is capable of data mining is essential. Bioinformatics software eliminates redundancies within each file, and the information generated can be analyzed and regrouped. The ESTs are later submitted to an online DB to search for similarities between the studied sequence (query) and the sequences available online (subject) to elucidate the protein codified by each gene. In shrimp, for example, several highly relevant gene products for homeostasis are highlighted, such as transcription regulatory units and enzyme inhibitors, which links these gene variations, causing different biological responses to stress to EST-SSRs. Data from genomic annotation makes it possible to elucidate a metabolic network, and uniting the fields of genetics and biochemistry to clarify major changes that may be occurring at the cellular level in addition to connecting genotypes to phenotypes. These markers may also be used as biosensors to show particular adaptations to each environment more precisely. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In general, supervised methods consist of two stages: (i) extraction/selection of informative features and (ii) classification of reviews by using learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). SVM have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. This paper presents an empirical comparison between SVM and ANN regarding document-level sentiment analysis. We discuss requirements, resulting models and contexts in which both approaches achieve better levels of classification accuracy. We adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bag-of-words model. Except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ANN produce superior or at least comparable results to SVM's. Specially on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews, ANN outperformed SVM by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data. Our results have also confirmed some potential limitations of both models, which have been rarely discussed in the sentiment classification literature, like the computational cost of SVM at the running time and ANN at the training time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present approach aimed at the identification and annotation of osmoprotectant-related sequences applied to short transcripts from a soybean HT-SuperSAGE (High Throughput Super Serial Analysis of Gene Expression; 26-bp tags) database, and also its comparison with other transcriptomic and genomic data available from different sources.Methods: A curated set of osmoprotectants related sequences was generated using text mining and selected seed sequences for identification of the respective transcripts and proteins in higher plants. To test the efficiency of the seed sequences, these were aligned against four HT-SuperSAGE contrasting libraries generated by our group using soybean tolerant and sensible plants against water deficit, considering only differentially expressed transcripts (p ≤ 0.05). Identified transcripts from soybean and their respective tags were aligned and anchored against the soybean virtual genome.Results: The workflow applied resulted in a set including 1,996 seed sequences that allowed the identification of 36 differentially expressed genes related to the biosynthesis of osmoprotectants [Proline (P5CS: 4, P5CR: 2), Trehalose (TPS1: 9, TPPB: 1), Glycine betaine (BADH: 4) and Myo-inositol (MIPS: 7, INPS1: 8)], also mapped in silico in the soybean genome (25 loci). Another approach considered matches using Arabidopsis full length sequences as seed sequences, and allowed the identification of 124 osmoprotectant-related sequences, matching ~10.500 tags anchored in the soybean virtual chromosomes. Osmoprotectant-related genes appeared clustered in all soybean chromosomes, with higher density in some subterminal regions and synteny among some chromosome pairs.Conclusions: Soybean presents all searched osmoprotectant categories with some important members differentially expressed among the comparisons considered (drought tolerant or sensible vs. control; tolerant vs. sensible), allowing the identification of interesting candidates for biotechnological inferences. The identified tags aligned to corresponding genes that matched 19 soybean chromosomes. Osmoprotectant-related genes are not regularly distributed in the soybean genome, but clustered in some regions near the chromosome terminals, with some redundant clusters in different chromosomes indicating their involvement in previous duplication and rearrangements events. The seed sequences, transcripts and map represent the first transversal evaluation for osmoprotectant-related genes and may be easily applied to other plants of interest. © 2013 Kido et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Abiotic stress; Arabidopsis; Differentially expressed gene; Expression dynamics; Genomic data; Glycine betaine; High throughput; High-throughput data; Higher plants; Identification and annotation; In-silico; Myo-inositol; Osmoprotectants; Short transcripts; Soybean genome; Super-serial analysis; Synteny; Text mining; Virtual chromosomes; Water deficits; Amino acids; Biochemistry; Data mining; Genes; Plants (botany); Throughput; Oilseeds; Arabidopsis; Embryophyta; Glycine max; Tracheophyta; article; cluster analysis; enzymology; expressed sequence tag; gene expression profiling; genetics; high throughput sequencing; osmotic pressure; physiological stress; plant gene; plant genome; plant seed; soybean; synteny; Cluster Analysis; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, Plant; Genome, Plant; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Osmotic Pressure; Seeds; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Synteny","Benko-Iseppon, A.M.; Departament of Genetics/Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, CEP 50.670-420, Brazil; email: ana.iseppon@gmail.com",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"23369061","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872372965

Much of the data in those files consists of unstructured text, whose analysis by computer examiners is difficult to be performed. In this context, automated methods of analysis are of great interest. In particular, algorithms for clustering documents can facilitate the discovery of new and useful knowledge from the documents under analysis. We present an approach that applies document clustering algorithms to forensic analysis of computers seized in police investigations. We illustrate the proposed approach by carrying out extensive experimentation with six well-known clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Single Link, Complete Link, Average Link, and CSPA) applied to five real-world datasets obtained from computers seized in real-world investigations. Experiments have been performed with different combinations of parameters, resulting in 16 different instantiations of algorithms. In addition, two relative validity indexes were used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. Related studies in the literature are significantly more limited than our study. Our experiments show that the Average Link and Complete Link algorithms provide the best results for our application domain. If suitably initialized, partitional algorithms (K-means and K-medoids) can also yield to very good results. Finally, we also present and discuss several practical results that can be useful for researchers and practitioners of forensic computing. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Clustering; forensic computing; text mining","Automated methods; Clustering; Clustering documents; Computer inspection; Document Clustering; Forensic analysis; Forensic computing; K-means; K-medoids; Number of clusters; Police investigations; Real-world datasets; Single link; Text mining; Validity index; Computer forensics; Data mining; Experiments; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Clustering algorithms","Da Cruz Nassif, L.F.; Brazilian Federal Police Department, São Paulo 05038-090, Brazil; email: nassif.lfcn@dpf.gov.br",,,15566013,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Existing methods are typically superlinear in space or execution time. Halite's strengths are that it is fast and scalable, while still giving highly accurate results. Specifically the main contributions of Halite are: 1) Scalability: it is linear or quasi linear in time and space regarding the data size and dimensionality, and the dimensionality of the clusters' subspaces; 2) Usability: it is deterministic, robust to noise, doesn't take the number of clusters as an input parameter, and detects clusters in subspaces generated by original axes or by their linear combinations, including space rotation; 3) Effectiveness: it is accurate, providing results with equal or better quality compared to top related works; and 4) Generality: it includes a soft clustering approach. Experiments on synthetic data ranging from five to 30 axes and up to 1 \rm million points were performed. Halite was in average at least 12 times faster than seven representative works, and always presented highly accurate results. On real data, Halite was at least 11 times faster than others, increasing their accuracy in up to 35 percent. Finally, we report experiments in a real scenario where soft clustering is desirable. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","data mining; Local-correlation clustering; moderate-to-high dimensional data","Data size; Execution time; Input parameter; Linear combinations; Local-correlation clustering; moderate-to-high dimensional data; Multi-resolutions; Multidimensional data; Number of clusters; Quasi-linear; Scalable clustering; Soft clustering; Superlinear; Synthetic data; Data mining; Experiments; Sodium chloride","Cordeiro, R.L.F.; Computer Science Department, University of São Paulo (USP) at São Carlos, Av. do Trabalhador Saocarlense, 400, 13566-590 São Carlos, Brazil; email: robson@icmc.usp.br",,,10414347,,ITKEE,,"English","IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871837457

The platform is based on the paradigm of service-oriented architecture (SOA) using the web services standard for extensibility and interoperability. This platform is composed of two main components: 1) web services, which implement data mining algorithms; 2) a user web interface, which can be used for modelling applications that use the services of the platform.

Although most data mining techniques, such as the use of association rules, may substantially reduce the search effort over large data sets, often, the consequential outcomes surpass the amount of information humanly manageable. On the other hand, important association rules may be overlooked owing to the setting of the support threshold, which is a very subjective metric, but rooted in most data mining techniques. This paper presents a study on the effects, in terms of precision and recall, of using a data preparation technique, called SemPrune, which is built on domain ontology. SemPrune is intended for pre- and post-processing phases of data mining. Identifying generalization/specialization relations, as well as composition/decomposition relations, is the key to successfully applying SemPrune. © 2013 Ferraz and Garcia.","Association rules; Data mining; Ontology; Post-processing; Preprocessing; Pruning",,"Ferraz, I.

An instance of this study is the hybrid version of the GRASP metaheuristic that incorporates a data mining process. Traditional GRASP is an iterative metaheuristic which returns the best solution reached over all iterations. In the hybrid GRASP proposal, after executing a significant number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of sub-optimal solutions for the optimization problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following GRASP iterations in the search through the combinatorial solution space. The hybrid data mining GRASP has been successfully applied for different combinatorial problems: the set packing problem, the maximum diversity problem, the server replication for reliable multicast problem and the p-median problem. In this work, we show that, not only the traditional GRASP, but also GRASP improved with the path-relinking heuristic - a memory-based intensification strategy - could benefit from exploring a data mining procedure. Computational experiments, comparing traditional GRASP with path-relinking and different path-relinking hybrid proposals, showed that employing the combination of path-relinking and data mining made the GRASP find better results in less computational time. Another contribution of this work is the application of the path-relinking hybrid proposal for the 2-path network design problem, which improved the state-of-the-art solutions for this problem. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although thermal comfort of horses has been widely studied, research has not reported its relationship to surface temperature (TS). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of data mining techniques as a tool to associate surface temperature with thermal comfort of horses. TS was measured using infrared thermographic image processing. Physiological and environmental variables were used to define the predicted class, which classified thermal comfort as ""comfort"" and ""discomfort"". The TS variables for the armpit, croup, breast and groin of horses and the predicted class were then submitted to a machine learning process. All dataset variables were considered relevant to the classification problem and the decision-tree model yielded an accuracy rate of 74.0%. The feature selection methods used to reduce computational cost and simplify predictive learning reduced the model accuracy to 70.1%; however the model became simpler with representative rules. For these selection methods and for the classification using all attributes, TS of armpit and breast had a higher rating power for predicting thermal comfort. The data mining techniques had discovered new variables relating to the thermal comfort of horses.","Data mining; Infrared thermography; Predictive modelling; Surface temperature; Thermoregulation","Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric temperature; Classification (of information); Data mining; Image processing; Learning systems; Physiology; Surface properties; Thermography (imaging); Computational costs; Decision-tree model; Environmental variables; Feature selection methods; Predictive modelling; Selection methods; Surface temperatures; Thermoregulation; Thermal comfort",,,"Katholieke Universiteit Leuven",,9789088263330,,,"English","Precis.

The production system advancement that generates these jobs began a process of valuing vocational and technological education by the government. As yet there is little research in this area, this study describes and analyzes the professional profiles of the alumni of technical courses in the Federal Institute in Rio de Janeiro State Interior of the campi Campos-Centro, Guarus and Macaé that performed or are performing the internship. The data mining technique is the main step of knowledge discovery in database with a large volume of data. For analysis and analytical treatment, the C4.5 algorithm implemented by the WEKA software has been adopted. It is concluded, through the results interpretation, that the internship appears as an efficient way for the inclusion of youth in the labor market and that the technical courses analyzed have quality. On the other hand, it is necessary to promote the practical classes and to monitor the internship experience, and from these actions, strategize continuous education for the alignment of teaching with the market reality.","Data mining; Internship; Labor market.; Professional education","Commerce; Education; Employment; Teaching; Technical presentations; Analytical treatment; Continuous educations; Internship; Knowledge discovery in database; Labor markets; Production system; Professional education; Technical professionals; Data mining",,,"International Foundation for Production Research (IFPR)",,,,,"English","Int.

Nowadays, hospitals and research centers can acquire large image databases which poses fundamental requirements for storage, processing and sharing data. In order to fulfill these requirements we have proposed the Shared Biological Image Manager (SBIM) system which has been developed using the programming languages PHP and Javascript as well as the Database Management System PostgreSQL. In this chapter, we propose an extension of the SBIM functionalities by incorporating data mining and image retrieval facilities. We describe an unified solution for both these services inside the Shared Biological Image Manager (SBIM) through Support Vector Machine (SVM) frameworks. Data mining is implemented using discriminant weights given by SVM separating hyperplanes to select the most discriminant features for two-class classification problems. For image retrieval, we consider an SVM ensemble based on the “one-against-all” SVM multi-class approach. The user specifies an initial feature space, the training set and the SVM (ensemble) configuration. After training, the SVM ensemble can be used to retrieve relevant data once given a query image. Finally, we discuss some details about the implementation of the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and discriminant features discovery approaches inside the SBIM system. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,"Neves, L.A.P.; UFPR—Federal University of Paraná, Rua Dr. Alcides Vieira Arcoverde, 1225, Brazil; email: lapneves@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",22129391,,,,"English","Lectur.

The data used referred to two generations of these three breeds during the first production cycle of 2009 and 2010. The parameters evaluated were: weekly rate of egg laying, egg weight and body weight. The research was divided into two approaches of analysis, the first being performed with the production data, aiming to identify critical points of phenotypic selections related to zootechnical characterization, and the second approach consisted in the association of the same production parameters together with the weather data of Santa Maria - RS. The data was analyzed using the Data Mining technique, using the classification task by building the decision tree with the J48 algorithm. The data mining indicated the average rate of egg laying at 25 weeks of age and the average weight of eggs at 33 weeks of age, and pointed these as the main variables related to the differentiation of breeds studied, (accuracy of 83.3%). On the second approach, the decision trees obtained showed accuracy between 88% and 91%, suggesting a strong association between the environmental variables and the production performance of the birds. The PRW breed is more sensitive to heat than the RIR and the PRB breed and they showed a higher rate of production during the prepeak phase. The data mining allowed to classify the productivity of the brown egg laying hens, which may indicate environmental influences on the phenotype of the different breeds studied.","Animal breeding; Bioclimatology; Brown eggs; Environment","Animalia; Aves","Ferreira, P.

The scale and the complexity of the roles to be considered can prevent the use of most audit methods and technologies so successful on the corporate world. The aim of this chapter is to propose a data mining method, based on naïve Bayes classifiers, to support a generic risk assessment process for audit planning. The method can sort auditable units by total risk score, fostering dedicated audit coverage to high-risk areas. Audit organizations can transition from a reactive response to a proactive approach to identify and correct issues that may be indicative of fraud, waste or abuse. Extensive databases containing records from government operations can be combined to auditors knowledge, fraud profiles, impact factors or any other relevant metric in order to rank an audit universe. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","data mining; probabilistic classifiers; public sector corruption; risk analysis","Crime; Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Assessment process; Bayes Classifier; Data mining methods; Governmental agency; Pro-active approach; Probabilistic classifiers; Public procurement; Public sector; Management",,,"Springer Verlag",18650929,9783642420160,,,"English","Commun.

However, most clustering techniques require the data to be centralized. One of them, the k-means, has been elected one of the most influential data mining algorithms. Although exact distributed versions of the k-means algorithm have been proposed, the algorithm is still sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster prototypes and requires that the number of clusters be specified in advance. Additionally, distributed versions of clustering algorithms usually requires multiple rounds of data transmission. This work tackles the problem of generating an approximated model for distributed clustering, based on k-means, for scenarios where the number of clusters of the distributed data is unknown and the data transmission rate is low or costly. A collection of algorithms is proposed to combine k-means clustering for each distributed subset of the data with a single round of communication. These algorithms are compared from two perspectives: the theoretical one, through asymptotic complexity analyses, and the experimental one, through a comparative evaluation of results obtained from experiments and statistical tests. © 2013 IEEE.","clustering; distributed data sets; k-means; low data transfer","Data communication systems; Data mining; Data transfer; Intelligent systems; clustering; Clustering techniques; Comparative evaluations; Data mining algorithm; Data transmission rates; Distributed clustering; Distributed data; K-means; Clustering algorithms",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769550923,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

One consequence of such fact is the generation of large volume of data. Usually, these data are collected by ICT technologies and then stored in transactional databases. In this environment, collected data might have complex internal relationships. This may be an issue to identify patterns and behaviors. Many institutions use data mining techniques for recognize hidden patterns and behaviors in their operational data. These patterns can assist to future activities planning and provide better management to financial resources. Intelligent analysis can be realized using the Support Tools and Support Decision Making (STSDM). These tools can analyze large volume of data through previously established rules. These rules are presented for STSDM in the training phase, and the tool learns about the patterns that should look. This paper proposes a model to support decision making based on self-organized maps. This model, applied to electronic government tools, can recognize patterns in large volume of data without the set of rules for training.

There are literally hundreds of methods proposed in the literature that rely on a dissimilarity measure as the main manner to compare objects. One notable example is the 1-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm. These methods frequently outperform more complex methods in tasks such as classification, clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. All these methods leave open the distance or dissimilarity function, being Euclidean distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) the two most used dissimilarity measures in the literature. This paper empirically compares 48 measures on 42 time series data sets. Our objective is to call the attention of the research community about other dissimilarity measures besides ED and DTW, some of them able to significantly outperform these measures in classification. Our results show that Complex Invariant Distance DTW (CIDDTW) significantly outperforms DTW and that CIDDTW, DTW, CID, Minkowski L-p (p-norm difference with data set-crafted 'p' parameter), Lorentzian L-infinity, Manhattan L-1, Average L-1/L-infinity (arithmetic average), Dice distance, and Jaccard distance outperform ED, but only CIDDTW, DTW, and CID outperform ED with statistical significance. © 2013 IEEE.","classification; dissimilarity measures; time series","Classification (of information); Intelligent systems; Time series; Classification algorithm; Dissimilarity function; Dissimilarity measures; Empirical - comparisons; Research communities; Statistical significance; Time series classifications; Time series data mining; Data mining",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769550923,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

The mining techniques used in the process usually have high computational costs and force the analyst to make complex choices. The complexity stems from the diversity of tasks that may be used in the analysis and from the large amount of alternatives to execute each task. The most common data mining tasks include data classification, labeling and clustering, outlier detection and missing data prediction. The large computational cost comes from the need to explore several alternative solutions, in different combinations, to obtain the desired information. Although the same tasks applied to traditional data are also necessary for more complex data, such as images, graphs, audio and long texts, the complexity and the computational costs associated to handling large amounts of these complex data increase considerably, making the traditional techniques impractical. Therefore, especial data mining techniques for this kind of data need to be developed. We discussed new data mining techniques for large sets of complex data, especially for the clustering task tightly associated to other mining tasks that are performed together. Specifically, this book described in detail three novel data mining algorithms well-suited to analyze large sets of complex data: the method Halite for correlation clustering [11, 13]; the method BoW for clustering Terabyte-scale datasets [14]; and the method QMAS for labeling and summarization [12]. © The Author(s) 2013.","Attention routing; Big data; Complex data; Correlation clustering; Linear or Quasi-linear complexity; Low-labor labeling; Summarization; Terabyte-scale data analysis",,"Cordeiro, R.L.F.; Computer Science Department (ICMC), University of Sao Paulo, Avenue do Trabalhador Saocarlense 400, Brazil; email: robson@icmc.usp.br",,"Springer",21915768,,,,"English","SpringerBriefs Comp.

However, given a Terabyte-scale dataset of moderate-to-high dimensionality, how could one cluster its points? Numerous successful, serial clustering algorithms for data in five or more dimensions exist in literature, including the algorithm Halite that we described in the previous chapter. However, the existing algorithms are impractical for datasets spanning Terabytes and Petabytes, and examples of applications with such huge amounts of data in five or more dimensions abound (e.g., Twitter crawl: >12 TB, Yahoo! operational data: 5 Petabytes [6]). This limitation was previously summarized in Table 3.1. For datasets that do not even fit on a single disk, parallelism is a first class option, and thus we must re-think, re-design and re-implement existing serial algorithms in order to allow for parallel processing. With that in mind, this chapter presents one work that explores parallelism using MapReduce for clustering huge datasets.

Its aim is to detect patterns that deviate from normal behaviour. Numerous outlier detection techniques have been developed but little work has been done in the context of semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised outlier detection techniques are relatively new and include some labels of normal instances for improving the accuracy of classifier with respect to outliers. In this paper, we introduced a new outlier score using a stochastic network-based semi-supervised technique. The original algorithm builds a network on the data set and exploits some available normal labels in order to classify the whole network by means of a particle competition and cooperation mechanism. Particles visit vertices in order to conquer as many vertices as possible. Our assumption behind such a score is that an outlier is statistically improbable, and the number of visits received by an outlier vertex is significantly different from the remaining vertices. Experimental results suggest that our technique is capable of detecting many of outliers and outperforms some traditional techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","outlier detection; particle competition and cooperation; semi-supervised learning","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Supervised learning; A-particles; Network-based; Original algorithms; Outlier Detection; Particle competition and cooperations; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Traditional techniques; Statistics",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769550923,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Organizing this data has become one of the biggest problems in Computer Science. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, highlighting those related to the Data Mining area, specifically the clustering algorithms. However, these algorithms are still a computational challenge because of the volume of data that needs to be processed. We found in the literature some proposals to make these algorithms feasible, and, recently, those related to parallelization on graphics processing units (GPUs) have presented good results. In this work we present the G-DBSCAN, a GPU parallel version of one of the most widely used clustering algorithms, the DBSCAN. Although there are other parallel versions of this algorithm, our technique distinguishes itself by the simplicity with which the data are indexed, using graphs, allowing various parallelization opportunities to be explored. In our evaluation we show that the G-DBSCAN using GPU, can be over 100x faster than its sequential version using CPU. © 2013 The Authors.

Many concept drift applications require fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re)trained with the latest available data. But the process of data labeling is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to acquisition of unlabeled data, thus usually only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are based on assumptions that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenging task in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach has been developed to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. We have extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm which uses a single classifier approach, naturally adapted to concept changes without any explicit drift detection mechanism. It has built-in mechanisms that provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually 'forgetting' older knowledge as older data items are no longer useful for the classification of newer data items.

In data preprocessing, several known techniques can be applied, or new ones developed, to improve data quality such that the mining results become more accurate and intelligible. Bioinformatics is one area with a high demand for generation of comprehensive models from large datasets. In this article, we propose a context-based data preprocessing approach to mine data from molecular docking simulation results. The test cases used a fully-flexible receptor (FFR) model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA enzyme (FFR_InhA) and four different ligands. Results: We generated an initial set of attributes as well as their respective instances. To improve this initial set, we applied two selection strategies. The first was based on our context-based approach while the second used the CFS (Correlation-based Feature Selection) machine learning algorithm. Additionally, we produced an extra dataset containing features selected by combining our context strategy and the CFS algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluated its performance based on various predictive (RMSE, MAE, Correlation, and Nodes) and context (Precision, Recall and FScore) measures. Conclusions: Statistical analysis of the results shows that the proposed context-based data preprocessing approach significantly improves predictive and context measures and outperforms the CFS algorithm. Context-based data preprocessing improves mining results by producing superior interpretable models, which makes it well-suited for practical applications in molecular docking simulations using FFR models. © 2013 Winck et al.",,"bacterial enzyme; InhA enzyme; unclassified drug; ligand; Article; controlled study; Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm; data analysis; data mining; data processing; machine learning; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; predictive value; statistical analysis; algorithm; article; enzymology; information processing; methodology; thermodynamics; Algorithms; Automatic Data Processing; Ligands; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Thermodynamics","Ruiz, D.D.; GPIN - Grupo de Pesquisa em Inteligência de Negócio, PPGCC, Faculdade de Informática, PUCRS Av.

The proposed method was evaluated on a decision tree classification using the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation and Equal Fixed Values Discretization approaches applied to 45 time series datasets that includes artificial and real-world data.

Our focus is on the extraction of hidden Web content presented in HTML pages generated from Web forms query submissions. While state-of-the-Art information extraction and cataloguing methods address this issue separately, DeepEC is able to simultaneously perform the extraction and cataloguing of data without expert user intervention. This is accomplished with the support of a knowledge base that allows semantic inference for relevant records to be extracted and then catalogued. An experimental evaluation on some Deep Web domains shows that DeepEC achieves very good results. If compared to related work, DeepEC provides a unified process for Deep Web content extraction and cataloguing, being able to infer missing values for extracted records to be catalogued.","Data cataloguing; Data extraction; Deep Web; Knowledge base","Information retrieval systems; Knowledge based systems; Semantics; Websites; Content extraction; Data cataloguing; Data extraction; Deep web; Experimental evaluation; Knowledge base; Query submission; Semantic inference; Data mining",,,"Association for Information Systems",,,,,"English","ECIS - Proc.

Different from VFDT, our proposed method ST does not depend on the number of reading samples to split a node. Because of it, ST is less conservative and describes the data since their first samples, being appropriate to be employed in medical environment, where not always a large number of data samples are available. We applied ST to four medical datasets, comparing the ST performance to the VFDT.

In this paper we present a new strategy based on Interval Arithmetic to store structural information obtained from experimental protein templates and predict native-like approximate three-dimensional structures of proteins. Our objective is to perform the prediction in a very fast manner and predict native-like structures that can be used as starting point structures to ab initio methods. We illustrate the efficacy of our method in five case studies of polypeptides.

The amount of information obtained (some of them irrelevant ones) increases day after day and creates opportunities for a new breed of systems named 'Recommender Systems'. These systems have emerged as one successful approach to tackle the problem of information overload. Traditional recommender systems suggest research items using well-known text mining techniques, however they fail when there are no identical keywords to match searches. In order to overcome this and other limitations, several studies have been made in order to verify the benefits of ontology-based approaches to create what is known as ontology-based recommender systems. This paper analyzes several ontology-based recommender systems and discusses some classification criteria in order to define a common architecture for these special types of recommender systems.

However, the manual term extraction is unfeasible due to the huge number of words presented in a domain corpus and also the human effort required to do the extraction. For the term extraction task, machine learning techniques have been used to perform automatic term extraction (ATE). Inductive learning is commonly used, but it requires a large number of words labeled as terms and non-terms to build a classification model and classify unseen words. A better solution is the use of transductive learning, since it requires a small number of labeled examples to classify words as terms and non-terms. In this paper, we propose the use of transductive learning to ATE. The obtained results demonstrate that the application of transductive learning to ATE produces better results than the results obtained by inductive learning. © 2013 IEEE.","Term Extraction; Transductive Learning","Data mining; Information science; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Automatic term extraction; Classification models; Inductive learning; Machine learning techniques; Natural language processing applications; Term extraction; Text mining; Transductive learning; Text processing",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781467352550,,,"English","Int.

Indirectly, gully erosion compromises crop productivity working as a link to watercourse allowing movement of detached topsoil particles from agricultural fields during heavy storm events. Furthermore, studies found reduction of the catchment area when active gullies are present. This complex process involves multiple factors and it demands to be studied consistently in order to locate the areas prone for gully erosion. The determination of gullies areas depends upon topographical, geological, and hydrological characteristics; however its location is mainly controlled by the high capacity of overland flow to cut the channel. We hypothesize that identification of gully in agricultural landscape can be performed from high-resolution elevation data products and unsupervised clustering approaches. In order to examine this hypothesis we have used variables resultant from of LiDAR-based terrain analysis as input of a three clustering techniques. A k-means, fuzzy k-means, and CLARA clustering algorithms were used to carry out the cluster analysis. The results of the cluster analysis suggested that 8 classes were optimal for group areas in the watershed. Elevation data from one field-scale watershed near Treynor in Pottawattamie County, IA, was used to calibration purpose and terrain analysis using slope, flow accumulation, plan convexity, topographic wetness Index, and stream power index were calculated. The cluster analysis has shown highest concordance with percentage of corrected classified pixels that approach based in medoid (CLARA) has obtained the best agreement of points within gullied area (30.1%). The results of this research might speed up gullies field surveys and also can serve as input in conservation planning framework.","Data mining; Feature classification; Lidar data; Soil erosion","Agriculture; Catchments; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conservation; Data flow analysis; Data mining; Erosion; Optical radar; Surface waters; Watersheds; Agricultural landscapes; Clustering techniques; Feature classification; Hydrological characteristics; LIDAR data; Soil erosion; Topographic wetness index; Unsupervised clustering; Landforms",,,"American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers",,9781627486651,,,"English","Am.

The k best similarity scores obtained by each hypothesis are averaged as ranking score for the hypothesis. Two variations of the developed system were utilized, one of them employing coreference detection and resolution techniques in order to take advantage of the discourse structure on the question answering process. The results generated by the systems in QA4MRE 2013 edition are presented and analyzed. The presented system should serve as a solid base for the development of a semantic approach on the task.",,"Data mining; Semantics; Text processing; Coreference; Discourse structure; Question Answering; Resolution techniques; Semantic approach; Set similarity; Similarity scores; Text mining techniques; Natural language processing systems",,"Forner P.Ferro N.Navigli R.Tufis D.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922051506

The framework encompasses a process to cluster client applications and derive usage profiles. The paper also discusses how usage profiles can help to access the real impact on clients of incompatible changes performed over service descriptions, and presents a usage-oriented compatibility assessment algorithm.

However, most of the semi-supervised classification methods proposed in the literature considers a stationary distribution of data. Which means that future data patterns tend to conform to the data distribution presented in data set throughout the application lifetime. However, for plenty of new variety of applications, this expected scenario is not compatible to reality. Therefore, the research of semi-supervised methods which comprises nonstationary data classification is of a major concern nowadays. In this paper, the KAOGINCSSL algorithm, which copes with non-stationary semi-supervised learning, is analysed when using two different strategies to spread the labels to train the classifiers. The first consist of employing the inductive algorithm KAOGSS to build the classifier and the second relies on using the transductive algorithm PMTLA to spread the labels prior to build the classifier.

However, the lack of consensus on which is the most suitable one for modeling applications in the geographical domain brings up a number of problems for field advancement, mainly problems of interoperability of database design and CASE tools. The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach allows the development of systems from an abstract view until the corresponding implementation code that can be automatized by means of models transformation. A UML Profile is an extension mechanism of UML which allows a structured and precise extension of its constructors, being a good solution to standardize domain-specific modeling, as it uses the entire UML infrastructure. This chapter describes the use of MDA approach in the design of databases in geographical domain; using a UML Profile called GeoProfile aligned with international standards of ISO 191xx series.

In NbSSL, not only the unlabeled data instances, but also the labeled ones, are able to bias the classification performance. Herein, we show some results and discussion on this phenomenon. Even the suitability of the free parameters of the NbSSL algorithms varies according to the available labeled data. Indeed, we propose a method for selecting representative data instances for labeling for NbSSL. In our sense the represent ability of a node is related to how inhomogeneous is its profile concerning the whole network. The proposed method uses Complex Networks centrality measures to identify which nodes present inhomogeneous profile. We perform this study by applying three NbSSL algorithms on Girvan-Newman and Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi modular networks. In the former, the nodes with high clustering coefficient are good representatives of the data and the nodes with high betweenness are the good representatives ones in the later. A high clustering coefficient means that the node lies in a much connected motif (clique) whereas a high betweenness means that the node lies interconnecting the modular structures. These results reveal the ability to improve the NbSSL performance by selecting representative data instances for manual labeling. © 2013 IEEE.","Classification; Complex networks; Data mining; Semi-supervised learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Data mining; Electric network topology; Centrality measures; Classification performance; Clustering coefficient; Information spreading; Modular network; Modular structures; Network topology; Semi-supervised learning; Supervised learning",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479931941,,,"English","Proc. - BRICS Ctries Congr.

In this scenario, it is difficult to discover the relationship between the process model and the run-time behavior, and to check whether the model is actually a good representation for that behavior. In this work, we introduce an approach that is able to capture such relationship in a hierarchical model. In addition, through a combination of process mining and agent-based simulation, the approach supports the improvement of the process model so that it becomes a better representation for the behavior of agents in the process.

Thus, the step-by-step approach where there was disagreement in at least one of the relationship variable can increase the sensitivity of the method and the use of similarity functions. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.","database record linkage; deterministic record linkage; Information systems; similarity function","Data handling; Information systems; Database records; Deterministic methods; Heterogeneous database; High specificity; Record linkage; Relationship variables; Similarity functions; Step-by-step approach; Database systems; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; Brazil; controlled vocabulary; data base; data mining; electronic medical record; factual database; medical record; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brazil; Data Mining; Database Management Systems; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Medical Record Linkage; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Vocabulary, Controlled","Suzuki, K.M.F.; School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Campus da USP Monte Alegre, Av. dos Bandeirantes 3900, CEP 14049-900.

Some of these tools, which target the organization and extraction of useful knowledge from this huge amount of data, rely on machine learning and data or text mining techniques, specifically automatic document classification algorithms. However, these algorithms are still a computational challenge because of the volume of data that needs to be processed. Some of the strategies available to address this challenge are based on the parallelization of ADC algorithms. In this work, we present GPU-NB, a parallel version of one of the most widely used document classification algorithms, the Näive Bayes, that uses graphics processing units (GPUs). In our evaluation using 6 different document collections, we show that the GPU-NB can maintain the same classification effectiveness (in most cases) while increasing the efficiency by up to 34× faster than its sequential version using CPU. GPU-NB is also up to 11× faster than a CPU-based parallel implementation of Näive Bayes running with 4 threads. Moreover, assuming an optimistic behavior of the CPU parallelization, GPU-NB should outperform the CPU-based implementation with up to 32 cores, at a small fraction of the cost. We also show that the efficiency of the GPU-NB parallelization is impacted by features of the document collections, particularly the number of classes, although the density of the collection (average number of occurrences of terms per document) has a significant impact as well. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computer architecture; Computer graphics; Information retrieval systems; Program processors; Sodium; Tools; Computational challenges; Document Classification; Document collection; Graphics processing units; Parallel implementations; Parallel version; Parallelizations; Text mining techniques; Data mining",,,"IEEE Computer Society",15506533,9781479929276,,,"English","Proc.

Furthermore, the dynamics inherent to classification problems, mainly on the Web, make this task even more challenging. Despite this fact, the actual impact of such temporal evolution on ADC is still poorly understood in the literature. In this context, this work concerns to evaluate, characterize and exploit the temporal evolution to improve ADC techniques. As first contribution we highlight the proposal of a pragmatical methodology for evaluating the temporal evolution in ADC domains. Through this methodology, we can identify measurable factors associated to ADC models degradation over time. Going a step further, based on such analyzes, we propose effective and efficient strategies to make current techniques more robust to natural shifts over time. We present a strategy, named temporal context selection, for selecting portions of the training set that minimize those factors. Our second contribution consists of proposing a general algorithm, called Chronos, for determining such contexts. By instantiating Chronos, we are able to reduce uncertainty and improve the overall classification accuracy. Empirical evaluations of heuristic instantiations of the algorithm, named WindowsChronos and FilterChronos, on two real document collections demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal. Comparing them against state-of-the-art ADC algorithms shows that selecting temporal contexts allows improvements on the classification accuracy up to 10%. Finally, we highlight the applicability and the generality of our proposal in practice, pointing out this study as a promising research direction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

CARS consider not only the ratings given to items by consumers (users), but also the context attributes related to these ratings. Several algorithms and methods have been proposed in the literature in order to deal with context-Aware ratings. Although there are lots of proposals and approaches working for this kind of recommendation, adequate and public datasets containing user's context-Aware ratings about items are limited, and usually, even these are not large enough to evaluate the proposed CARS very well. One solution for this issue is to crawl this kind of data from e-commerce websites. However, it could be very time-expensive and also complicated due to problems regarding legal rights and privacy. In addition, crawled data from e-commerce websites may not be enough for a complete evaluation, being unable to simulate all possible users' behaviors and characteristics. In this article, we propose a methodology to generate a synthetic dataset for context-Aware recommender systems, enabling researchers and developers to create their own dataset according to the characteristics in which they want to evaluate their algorithms and methods. Our methodology enables researchers to define the user's behavior of giving ratings based on the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) associated to their profiles. © 2013 IEEE.","Context-Aware Recommender Systems; Datamining; Synthetic Data Generator","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Coherent scattering; Data mining; Distribution functions; Probability distributions; Recommender systems; Websites; Context attributes; Context-Aware; Context-aware recommender systems; E-commerce websites; Legal rights; Synthetic data; Electronic commerce",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479931941,,,"English","Proc. - BRICS Ctries Congr.

That being said, integration of the various links of the supply chain is necessary in order to make it competitive. In the process of cost reduction in the supply chain, the adoption of lean manufacturing practices enables the elimination of waste and the processes become more reliable; these characteristics form the Lean Supply Chain Management-LSCM. Another factor of great importance for the success of supply chains is the adoption of environmentally sustainable practices, known as Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). In other words, to produce and distribute products with the least environmental impact possible, covering efforts to reduce the consumption of water, energy and emission of pollutants, and practices related to waste recovery and return of materials for reuse in the supply chain. The combination of LSCM and GSCM practices form the Lean and Green Supply Chain Management (LGSCM). Then, following this line of thought, this research project aims to: 1) analyze the main characteristics of the scientific production linked to LGSCM; and 2) identify the main connections between LSCM and GSCM. In order to achieve the proposed objective, the research will be carried out in two phases. The first is a bibliographic review of 438 articles based on journals related to the areas of study between 1995 to 2012 and, the second is a theoretical conceptual study via content analysis of the selected articles. As principal results, the research presents the primary characteristics in the studies related to the subject, the fundamental connections between LSCM and GSCM and the development of a framework integrating LSCM with GSCM via a theoretical structure.","Bibliometrics; Connections; Framework; Lean and green supply chain management; Literature review","Chains; Cost reduction; Data mining; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Waste management; Water conservation; Water pollution; Waveguide couplers; Bibliographic reviews; Bibliometrics; Framework; Green supply chain management; Literature reviews; Quality requirements; Sustainable practices; Theoretical structure; Supply chain management",,,"International Foundation for Production Research (IFPR)",,,,,"English","Int.

Especially in the Information Technology (IT) area, it is important to control and work up existing enterprise governance enablers. COBIT 5 is a framework for governing and managing enterprise Information Technology (IT) that supports enterprise executives and management staff in defining and achieving business goals and related IT goals. The specification of COBIT 5 highlights events in the enterprise's internal and external environment that can typically signal or trigger a focus on the processes related to IT governance and management. However, it lacks to follow a knowledge perspective. Therefore, we propose an adaptation to the COBIT 5 framework to use competitive intelligence on its processes. We specifically propose to apply the BPECREL (Business Process External Context Relevance) method, which identifies and prioritizes external variables that impact on the execution of a process and of its specific activities.

For this type of surveillance the user's location is an essential piece of information, but a substantial number of users choose not to disclose their geographical information. However, characteristics of the users' behavior, such as the friends they associate with and the types of messages published may hint on their spatial location. In this paper, we present a method to infer the spatial location of Twitter users. Unlike the approaches proposed so far, we incorporate two sources of information to learn the geographical position: the text posted by users and their friendship network. We propose a probabilistic approach that jointly models the geographical labels and the Twitter texts of the users organized in the form of a graph representing the friendship network. We use the Markov random field probability model to represent the network and learning is carried out through a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation technique to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the missing geographical labels. We demonstrate the utility of this model in a large dataset of Twitter users, where the ground truth is the location given by the GPS position, GeoIP location or declared location. The method is evaluated and compared to two baseline algorithms that employ either of these two types of information. The accuracy rates achieved are significantly better than those of the baseline methods. © 2013 IEEE.","Geographic Targeting; Geolocation Estimation; Network Learning; Spatial Data Mining","Intelligent systems; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Geographic Targeting; Geographical information; Geographical positions; Geolocations; Markov chain monte carlo simulation; Network learning; Probabilistic approaches; Spatial data mining; Social networking (online)",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769550923,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Nevertheless, many interesting 0/1 data naturally appear as n-ary relations with n = 3. A timely challenge is to extend local pattern extraction, e. g., closed pattern mining, to such contexts. When considering higher arities, faint noise affects more and more the quality of the extracted patterns. We study a declarative specification of error-tolerant patterns by means of new primitive constraints and the design of an efficient algorithm to extract every solution pattern. It exploits the enumeration principles of the state-of-the-art Data-Peeler algorithm for n-ary relation mining. Efficiently enforcing error-tolerance crucially depends on innovative strategies to incrementally compute partial information on the data. Our prototype is tested on both synthetic and real datasets.

Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement.

Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place. This paper describes a Bayesian framework that takes as input class labels from existing classifiers (designed based on labeled data from the source domain), as well as cluster labels from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. This framework is particularly useful when the statistics of the target data drift or change from those of the training data. We also show that the proposed framework is privacy-aware and allows performing distributed learning when data/models have sharing restrictions. Experiments show that our framework can yield superior results to those provided by applying classifier ensembles only.

Box 96, Piracicaba 13400-970, SP, Brazil","In Brazil, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) productivity is severely affected by drought stress due to low technology cultivation systems. Our purpose was to identify differentially expressed genes in roots of a genotype tolerant to water deficit (BAT 477) when submitted to an interruption of irrigation during its development. A SSH library was constructed taking as ""driver"" the genotype Carioca 80SH (susceptible to drought). After clustering and data mining, 1572 valid reads were obtained, resulting in 1120 ESTs (expressed sequence tags). We found sequences for transcription factors, carbohydrates metabolism, proline-rich proteins, aquaporins, chaperones and ubiquitins, all of them organized according to their biological processes. Our suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) library was validated through RT-qPCR experiment by assessing the expression patterns of 10 selected genes in both genotypes under stressed and control conditions. Finally, the expression patterns of 31 ESTs, putatively related to drought responses, were analyzed in a time-course experiment. Our results confirmed that such genes are more expressed in the tolerant genotype during stress; however, they are not exclusive, since different levels of these transcripts were also detected in the susceptible genotype. In addition, we observed a fluctuation in gene regulation over time for both the genotypes, which seem to adopt and adapt different strategies in order to develop tolerance against this stress. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Drought stress; Gene expression; Phaseolus vulgaris L.; Root; Suppressive subtractive hybridization library","article; controlled study; drought stress; drought tolerance; expressed sequence tag; gene expression; gene identification; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; genotype; nonhuman; Phaseolus vulgaris; plant gene; plant response; plant root; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; soil water content; suppression subtractive hybridization; adaptation; cluster analysis; computer program; drought; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; humidity; metabolism; Phaseolus; physiology; plant gene; reproducibility; soil; subtractive hybridization; time; messenger RNA; soil; transcription factor; water; Adaptation, Physiological; Cluster Analysis; Droughts; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genotype; Humidity; Phaseolus; Plant Roots; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Software; Soil; Subtractive Hybridization Techniques; Time Factors; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Water","Gomes Caldas, D.

Together with the test cases that provide more semantics to the search task, keywords taken from class and method names are still required. Therefore, the effectiveness of the approach also relies on how good these keywords are, i.e., how frequently they are chosen by developers to name the desired functions. To help users choose adequate words in their query test cases, visual aids can be used. In this paper we propose thesaurus-based tag clouds to show developers terms that are more frequently used in the code repository to improve their search. Terms are generated by looking up words similar to the initial keywords on a thesaurus. Tag clouds are then formed based on the frequency in which these terms appear in the code base. Our approach was implemented with an English thesaurus as an extension to CodeGenie, a Java- and Eclipse-based TDCS tool. Our evaluation shows that the approach can help improve the number of returned results. We also noticed the visual aid can be especially useful for non-native speakers of the language in which the code repository is written. These users are frequently unaware of the most common terms used to name specific functionality in the code, in the given language. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Communication; Computer software reusability; Data mining; Metadata; Semantics; Thesauri; Code search; Non-native speakers; Search queries; Search tasks; Tag clouds; Test case; Visual aids; Testing",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769551562,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Pennsylvania Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","Animal behavioral parameters can be used to assess welfare status in commercial broiler breeders. Behavioral parameters can be monitored with a variety of sensing devices, for instance, the use of video cameras allows comprehensive assessment of animal behavioral expressions. Nevertheless, the development of efficient methods and algorithms to continuously identify and differentiate animal behavior patterns is needed. The objective this study was to provide a methodology to identify hen white broiler breeder behavior using combined techniques of image processing and computer vision. These techniques were applied to differentiate body shapes from a sequence of frames as the birds expressed their behaviors. The method was comprised of four stages: (1) identification of body positions and their relationship with typical behaviors. For this stage, the number of frames required to identify each behavior was determined; (2) collection of image samples, with the isolation of the birds that expressed a behavior of interest; (3) image processing and analysis using a filter developed to separate white birds from the dark background; and finally (4) construction and validation of a behavioral classification tree, using the software tool Weka (model J48). The constructed tree was structured in 8 levels and 27 leaves, and it was validated using two modes: the ""set training"" mode with an overall rate of success of 96.7%, and the ""cross validation"" mode with an overall rate of success of 70.3%. The results presented here confirmed the feasibility of the method developed to identify white broiler breeder behavior for a particular group of study. Nevertheless, more improvements in the method can be made in order to increase the validation overall rate of success. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Image analysis; Poultry; Precision agriculture in animal production","Birds; Data mining; Image analysis; Poultry; Sensors; Animal production; Behavioral parameters; Classification trees; Combined techniques; Comprehensive assessment; Cross validation; Image processing and analysis; Image processing and computer vision; Computer vision; algorithm; commercial activity; identification method; image processing; parameterization; poultry; reproductive behavior; software; Animalia; Aves; Gallirallus australis","Pereira, D.F.; School of Business, Univ.

From a pharmacovigilance perspective, numerous challenges exist in applying its existing methods to studying the safety profile of herbal medicines, particularly where used by indigenous cultures. This paper aims to contribute to the methodological aspects of EB/EP field work, and to extend the reach of pharmacovigilance, by proposing a tool comprising a list of questions that could be applied during interview and observational studies. The questions focus on the collection of information on the safety profile of traditional herbal medicines as it is embedded in traditional knowledge, as well as on identifying personal experiences (spontaneous reports) of adverse or undesirable effects associated with the use of traditional herbal medicines. Questions on the precise composition of traditional prescriptions or 'recipes', their preparation, storage, administration and dosing are also included. Strengths and limitations of the tool are discussed. From this interweaving of EB/EP and pharmacovigilance arises a concept of ethnopharmacovigilance for traditional herbal medicines: the scope of EB/EP is extended to include exploration of the potential harmful effects of medicinal plants, and the incorporation of pharmacovigilance questions into EB/EP studies provides a new opportunity for collection of 'general' traditional knowledge on the safety of traditional herbal medicines and, importantly, a conduit for collection of spontaneous reports of suspected adverse effects. Whether the proposed tool can yield data sufficiently rich and of an appropriate quality for application of EB/EP (e.g. data verification and quantitative analysis tools) and pharmacovigilance techniques (e.g. causality assessment and data mining) requires field testing. © 2012 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Aconitum extract; alkaloid; antidote; atropine; beta carboline derivative; Chenopodium ambrosioides extract; Euphorbia extract; harmaline; harmine; herbaceous agent; n,n dimethyltryptamine; plant glycoside; scopolamine; tetrahydroharmaline; unclassified drug; aconite; adverse drug reaction; allopathy; article; cassava; chemical composition; Chenopodium ambrosioides; clinical assessment; diet; diet restriction; drug contraindication; drug determination; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug information; drug safety; drug storage; drug surveillance program; drug synthesis; drug tolerability; ethnobotany; ethnopharmacology; Euphorbiaceae; fermentation; fungus; health survey; Helicteris muscosa; herbal medicine; human; medicinal plant; nonhuman; observational study; pharmacodynamics; phytochemistry; plant root; prescription; priority journal; Psittacanthus robustus; semi structured interview; Animals; Ethnobotany; Ethnopharmacology; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Traditional; Pharmacovigilance; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal","Rodrigues, E.; Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Ethnobotanical and Ethnopharmacological Studies (CEE), Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), Rua Arthur Riedel, Diadema SP 275-09972-270, Brazil; email: 68.eliana@gmail.com",,,01145916,,DRSAE,"23315291","English","Drug Saf.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876573214
