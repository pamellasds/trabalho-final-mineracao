The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of age, use of vitamin D, the asymmetry of limbs and gait score, the degree of leg injuries in broilers, using data mining. The analysis was performed on a data set obtained from a field experiment in which it was used two groups of birds with 30 birds each, a control group and one treated with vitamin D. It was evaluated the gait score, the asymmetry between the right and left toes, and the degree of leg injuries. The Weka ® software was used in data mining. In particular, C4.5 algorithm (also known as J48 in Weka environment) was used for the generation of a decision tree. The results showed that age is the factor that most influences the degree of leg injuries and that the data from assessments of gait score were not reliable to estimate leg weakness in broilers.","Decision tree; Gait score; Poultry","Aves; Gallirallus australis; Gallus gallus","Cordeiro, A.F.S.; Zootecnista, Doutoranda em Engenharia Agrícola, FEAGRI, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,,01006916,,,,"English","Eng.

The midgut of the mosquito is the first barrier that pathogens must overcome to establish infection and represents one of the main immunologically active sites of the insect. Nevertheless, little is known about the proteins involved in the defense against pathogens, and even in the processing of food, and the detoxification of metabolites. The identification of proteins exclusively expressed in the midgut is the first step in understanding the complex physiology of this tissue and can provide insight into the mechanisms of pathogen-vector interaction. However, identification of the locally expressed proteins presents a challenge because the Ae. albopictus genome has not been sequenced. Methods. In this study, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) was combined with liquid chromatography in line with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data mining to identify the major proteins in the midgut of sugar-fed Ae. albopictus females. Results: Fifty-six proteins were identified by sequence similarity to entries from the Ae. aegypti genome. In addition, two hypothetical proteins were experimentally confirmed. According to the gene ontology analysis, the identified proteins were classified into 16 clusters of biological processes. Use of the STRING database to investigate protein functional associations revealed five functional networks among the identified proteins, including a network for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, a group associated with ATP production and a network of proteins that interact during detoxification of toxic free radicals, among others. This analysis allowed the assignment of a potential role for proteins with unknown function based on their functional association with other characterized proteins. Conclusion: Our findings represent the first proteome map of the Ae. albopictus midgut and denotes the first steps towards the description of a comprehensive proteome map of this vector. In addition, the data contributes to the functional annotation of Aedes spp. genomes using mass spectrometry-based proteomics data combined with complementary gene prediction methods. © 2012 Saboia-Vahia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Aedes albopictus; Culicidae; Mass spectrometry; Midgut; Proteome; Proteomics; Two-dimensional electrophoresis","Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; amino acid metabolism; amino acid sequence; article; carbohydrate metabolism; female; liquid chromatography; midgut; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; tandem mass spectrometry; two dimensional electrophoresis; Aedes; Animals; Carbohydrates; Chromatography, Liquid; Computational Biology; Diet; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Insect Proteins; Proteome; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Aedes albopictus; Arbovirus; Culicidae; Hexapoda","Domont, G.B.; Unidade de Proteômica, Laboratório de Química de Proteínas, Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: gilberto@iq.ufrj.br",,,17563305,,,"23232105","English","Parasites Vectors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870712957

Methods: Aiming to compare traditional approach performance and multi-relational for mining association rules, this paper discusses an empirical study between PatriciaMine - an traditional algorithm - and its corresponding multi-relational proposed, MR-Radix. Results: This work showed advantages of the multi-relational approach in performance over several tables, which avoids the high cost for joining operations from multiple tables and semantic losses. The performance provided by the algorithm MR-Radix shows faster than PatriciaMine, despite handling complex multi-relational patterns. The utilized memory indicates a more conservative growth curve for MR-Radix than PatriciaMine, which shows the increase in demand of frequent items in MR-Radix does not result in a significant growth of utilized memory like in PatriciaMine. Conclusion: The comparative study between PatriciaMine and MR-Radix confirmed efficacy of the multi-relational approach in data mining process both in terms of execution time and in relation to memory usage. Besides that, the multi-relational proposed algorithm, unlike other algorithms of this approach, is efficient for use in large relational databases. © 2012, Valêncio et al; licensee Springer.","Association rules; Mining frequent itemsets; MR-Radix; Multi-relational data mining; Relational databases","Association rules; Joining; Semantics; Comparative studies; Data mining process; Mining associations; Mining frequent itemsets; MR-Radix; Multirelational data mining; Relational Database; Traditional approaches; Data mining","Valêncio, C.R.; São Paulo State University - Unesp, Rua Cristóvão Colombo, Brazil; email: valencio@ibilce.unesp.br",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",21921962,,,,"English","Hum.-centric Comput.

Therefore, we tested the performance of three classifiers on the KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset and selected the best classifiers. We initially tested a Decision Tree and a Neural Network using this dataset, suggesting improvements by reducing the number of attributes from 42 to 27 considering only two classes of detection, normal and intrusion. Finally, we tested the Decision Tree and Bayesian Network classifiers considering five classes of attack: Normal, DOS, U2R, R2L and Probing.

However, most clustering techniques require the data to be centralized. One of them, the k-means, has been elected one of the most influential data mining algorithms. Although exact distributed versions of the k-means algorithm have been proposed, the algorithm is still sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster prototypes and requires that the number of clusters be specified in advance. This work tackles the problem of generating an approximated model for distributed clustering, based on k-means, for scenarios where the number of clusters of the distributed data is unknown. We propose a collection of algorithms that generate and select k-means clustering for each distributed subset of the data and combine them afterwards. The variants of the algorithm are compared from two perspectives: the theoretical one, through asymptotic complexity analyses, and the experimental one, through a comparative evaluation of results obtained from a collection of experiments and statistical tests. © 2012 IEEE.","clustering; distributed data sets; k-means","Asymptotic complexity; Cluster prototype; clustering; Clustering techniques; Comparative evaluations; Data mining algorithm; Distributed clustering; Distributed data; K-means; k-Means algorithm; K-means clustering; Large datasets; Number of clusters; Data mining; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Clustering algorithms","Coelho Naldi, M.; Department of Exact and Technological Sciences, Federal University of Vicosa-UFV, Rio Paranaiba, Brazil; email: murilocn@ufv.br",,,15224899,9780769548234,,,"English","Proc. - Brazilian Symp.

In Brazil, in the last three decades an explosive growth in production has occurred, nearly thirty times, causing a chain of unprecedent changes of land uses and land cover (LULC) in the territory. Therefore, it becomes highly necessary to develop means to monitor such LULC changes, and remote sensing is one of the more potential tools for this monitoring. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology for contributing in the mapping and monitoring soybeans planted areas, with time-series of remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Two main techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map soybeans areas, and DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. The study area comprises three municipalities in the northwest of São Paulo State, being this area well representative of the agricultural conditions of the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. The statistics indicated an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88.These results indicate that the combination of OBIA + DM + multitemporal imagery is very efficient and promising for the soybeans mapping process. © 2012 IEEE.","agriculture; Data Mining (DM); Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA); remote sensing; Soybean","Agricultural conditions; Argentina; Classification accuracy; Explosive growth; Kappa coefficient; Knowledge model; Land cover; LANDSAT; Landsat imagery; Major producers; Mapping process; Multi-temporal; Object based image analysis; Planted areas; Potential tool; Soybean; Study areas; Agriculture; Data mining; Geology; Image analysis; Mapping; Oilseeds; Remote sensing","Formaggio, A.R.; National Institute for Space Research, INPE, São José dos Campos SP, Brazil; email: formag@dsr.inpe.br",,,,,IGRSE,,"English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873136944

They represent to the scientific and medical communities, a significant target for bioactive and drug discovery programs. The model of classification of enzymes and GPCR is characterized by its hierarchical structure in format of tree and this makes more difficult its prediction. In this work we propose an adapted version of Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) data mining algorithm which tends to be more efficient than statistical methods based on homology used in tool such as PSI-BLAST. Hence, a new global model approach, called HLCS (Hierarchical Learning Classifier System) is used to predict the function of enzymes and GPCR, respecting its organizational structure of classes throughout the model development. The HLCS is expressed as a set of IF-THEN classification rules, which have the advantage of representing comprehensible knowledge to biologist users. The HLCS is evaluated with eight datasets from enzymes and GPCR, and compared with a Global Naive Bayes algorithm, named GMNB. In the tests realized the HLCS outperformed the GMNB in the databases of the GPCR proteins group type. © 2012 IEEE.","Hierarchical Classification; Learning Classifier Systems; Prediction of protein function","Classification rules; Data mining algorithm; Data sets; Drug discovery; G-protein coupled receptors; Global models; Hierarchical classification; Hierarchical learning; Hierarchical structures; Learning classifier system; Medical community; Model development; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Organizational structures; Prediction of Protein Function; Protein family; PSI-BLAST; Algorithms; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Forecasting; Learning systems; Proteins; Enzymes","Romão, L.M.; Universidade Da Região de Joinville, Departamento de Informática, Joinville - SC, Brazil; email: luizmromao@gmail.com",,,,9781467343589,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Several studies have shown that elements such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are essential for reproduction and can prevent oxidative stress. However, toxic elements such as lead, nickel, and arsenic can have adverse effects on reproduction. In this paper, we applied a simple and fast method of multi-element analysis to bovine semen samples from Zebu and European classes used in reproduction programs and artificial insemination. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) using aqueous medium calibration and the samples were diluted in a proportion of 1:50 in a solution containing 0.01% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and 0.5% (vol/vol) nitric acid. Rhodium, iridium, and yttrium were used as the internal standards for ICP-MS analysis. To develop a reliable method of tracing the class of bovine semen, we used data mining techniques that make it possible to classify unknown samples after checking the differentiation of known-class samples. Based on the determination of 15 elements in 41 samples of bovine semen, 3 machine-learning tools for classification were applied to determine cattle class. Our results demonstrate the potential of support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) chemometric tools to identify cattle class. Moreover, the selection tools made it possible to reduce the number of chemical elements needed from 15 to just 8. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.","Bovine semen; Data mining; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); Mineral","trace element; algorithm; animal; animal disease; article; artificial insemination; breeding; cattle; chemistry; dairying; data mining; male; mass spectrometry; methodology; quantitative trait; sperm; Algorithms; Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Dairying; Data Mining; Insemination, Artificial; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Semen; Trace Elements; Bos; Bos indicus; Bovinae","Barbosa, F.; Laboratório de Toxicologia e Essencialidade de Metais, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto-USP, Avenida do Café s/n, Monte Alegre, 14040-903, Ribeirão Preto-SP, Brazil; email: fbarbosa@fcfrp.usp.br",,,00220302,,,"23040024","English","J.

When dealing with interrelated data that does not have any attributes and is represented in the form of nodes and their relationships, this task is also referred to as community mining. There has been a considerable number of approaches proposed in recent years for mining communities in a given network. But little work has been done on how to evaluate community mining results. The common practice is to use an agreement measure to compare the mining result against a ground truth, however, the ground truth is not known in most of the real world applications. In this paper, we investigate relative clustering quality measures defined for evaluation of clustering data points with attributes and propose proper adaptations to make them applicable in the context of social networks. Not only these relative criteria could be used as metrics for evaluating quality of the groupings but also they could be used as objectives for designing new community mining algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Clustering data; Clustering quality measures; Community mining; Data points; Ground truth; Mining communities; Real-world application; Social Networks; Algorithms; Data mining; Social networking (online); Quality control","Rabbany, R.; Computing Science Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton, T6G-2E5, Canada; email: rabbanyk@ualberta.ca",,,,9780769547992,,,"English","Proc.

The datasets design was aimed at understanding the specific circumstances where each method, simple or combined, would present better performance. Results from this experiment suggest that blending classifiers using segmentation is a viable solution to improve the performance of both statistic regressions, that both FBTSeg and NNTree are in general more predictive than the traditional segmentation, while bagging and boosting are more effective alternatives for improving neural networks models. © 2012 IEEE.","classification methods; data splitting; machine learning; segmentation","Classification methods; Combination of classifiers; Data splitting; Logistic regressions; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Neural network trees; Neural networks model; Segmentation methods; Blending; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Logistics; Neural networks","Santos, R.A.F.; Serasa Experian Company, Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia, São Paulo-SP, Brazil; email: rafss@hotmail.com",,,10823409,9780769549156,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

The test statistic combines two terms, the log-likelihood of the data and the amount of information necessary to computationally code each potential cluster. This second term penalizes the search algorithm avoiding the detection of oddly shaped clusters and it is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Our MDL method reaches an automatic compromise between bias and variance. We present simulated results showing that its power performance as compared to the usual scan statistic and the high accuracy of the MDL to identify clusters that are scattered on the tree.

However, due to characteristics of textual data, some algorithms for data categorization are not efficient for text categorization. Characteristics of textual data such as sparsity and high dimensionality sometimes impair the quality of generalpurpose classifiers. Here, we propose a text classifier based on a bipartite heterogeneous network used to represent textual document collections. Such algorithm induces a classification model assigning weights to objects that represents terms of the textual document collection. The induced weights correspond to the influence of the terms in the classification of documents they appear. The least-mean-square algorithm is used in the inductive process. Empirical evaluation using a large amount of textual document collections shows that the proposed IMBHN algorithm produces significantly better results than the κ-NN, C4.5, SVM and Naïve Bayes algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.","Heterogeneous network; Text categorization","Bayes algorithms; Classification models; Empirical evaluations; High dimensionality; Inductive models; Inductive process; Large amounts; Least mean square algorithms; Numeric data; Preprocessing phase; Text categorization; Text classifiers; Textual data; Textual documents; Algorithms; Heterogeneous networks; Information retrieval systems; Text processing; Data mining","Rossi, R.G.; University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil; email: ragero@icmc.usp.br",,,15504786,9780769549057,,,"English","Proc.

However, no article has proposed the use of SSM in order to guide all CM phases. This article presents a theoretical discussion involving SSM in simulation and discussion on the methodology's knowledge acquisition capabilities and contributes to simulation literature by proposing a step-by-step SSM-CM approach, based on a combination of previously established SSM-CM techniques from scientific literature, in order to guide all conceptual modeling phases.

By means of weighted intra-class correlation matrices and as imilarity measure between matrices, WCMS is able to as sign a class to new unknown cases (samples). WCMS formulates no previous assumptions regarding the data and for better performance may be previously calibrated by means of a training set. Its process of classification is flexible and benefits both from the knowledge arisen from the training set and the information proportioned by the new sample to be classified itself. WCMS was applied for classification in practice and its performance was compared with other popular classification algorithms that are based on the data covariance structure using nine real datasets available in the UCI data repository. The results showed that the performance of the WCMS algorithm was at least as competitive as any of the other tested methods. Concerning the nine focused dat a sets, WCMS presented it self as superior in terms of classification accuracy in five of them. It was concluded that WCMS can be used as an effective classification tool in a wide range of data sets.","Algorithm; Classification; Data mining; Prediction","Better performance; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification tool; Correlation matrix; Data covariance; Data repositories; Weighted correlation; Algorithms; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Data mining","Barreto, A.S.; Ministry of Finance, Brasília-DF, CEP 70.048-900, Brazil",,,,9789728939694,,,"English","Proc.

Method: Data and text mining software were used in order to reach a systematic overview of the main trends of the literature, based upon which an original conception of MTT was proposed, in line with some original perspectives on its neurobiological structure. Results: The review of the literature shows that there are no studies on MTT in decision-making, it also shows the existence of nine neuroimaging and one meta-analysis. There is a debate regarding the extent to which non-human animals show MTT; our perspectives on MTT rely on the mental processing of the present, in opposition to more traditional approaches, which tend to focus the relation between MTT and memory.

The capacity to provide information in real time has stimulated many companies to use this service to understand their consumers. In this direction, TV stations have adopted Twitter for shortening the distance between them and their viewers, and use such information as a feedback mechanism for their shows. The sentiment analysis task can be used as one such feedback mechanism. This task corresponds to classifying a text according to the sentiment that the writer intended to transmit. A classifier usually requires a pre-classifled data sample to determine the class of new data. Typically, the sample is pre-classified manually, making the process time consuming and reducing its real time applicability for big data. This paper proposes an automatic sentiment classifier for Twitter messages, and uses TV shows from Brazilian stations for benchmarking. The automatic sentiment analysis reduces human intervention and, thus, the complexity and cost of the whole process. To assess the performance of the proposed system tweets related to a Brazilian TV show were captured in a 24h interval and fed into the system. The proposed technique achieved an average accuracy of 90%. © 2012 IEEE.","Big Data; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Twitter","Big datum; Communication platforms; Data sample; Feedback mechanisms; Human intervention; Micro-blogging services; Process time; Real time; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; TV stations; Twitter; Whole process; Data mining; Television stations; Social networking (online)","Lima, A.C.E.S.; Natural Computing Laboratory, Mackenzie Presbyterian University, Sào Paulo, Brazil; email: aceslima@gamol.com",,,,9781467347921,,,"English","Proc.

These phenomena often present unstable behavior and are studied by means of unsupervised induction processes based on data clustering. Currently, clustering processes have shown serious limitations in their applications to data streams due to the demands imposed by behavioral changes and unlimited data collection. However, despite the key distinctions in between traditional data sets, which are finite and unordered, and data streams, which are essentially infinite sequences, studies have overlooked the dynamic and transient nature of streams, limiting the appropriate understanding of phenomena. The lack of a theoretical analysis for the problem of data streams clustering led us to propose, in this paper, a formalization based on Set Theory. This formalization made it possible to identify and propose basic properties for the design and comparison of data stream clustering algorithms. It is expected to be a starting point to understand the foundations of unsupervised induction based on clustering and, mainly, the modeling of phenomena.","Artificial intelligence; Data clustering; Data mining; Data streams; Machine learning; Set theory; Unsupervised learning","Analysis of algorithms; Behavioral changes; Clustering process; Data clustering; Data stream; Data stream clustering; Induction process; Unstable behavior; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data mining; Learning systems; Set theory; Unsupervised learning; Clustering algorithms","Albertini, M.K.; Department of Computer Sciences, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

The method that guided the development process involves the construction of ontologies and a dictionary of terms that reflect the structure of the vocabulary domain. The proposed process is capable of generating information that answers questions such as: ""In the opinion of the customer, which car is better: Corsa or Palio? Which one is more beautiful? Which engine is stronger?"" To answer these questions by comparison, one can show a general view reflected on different social networks, indicating, for example, that for a given vehicle, a certain percentage of responses are considered positive, while for others, the percentage is considered negative.

Such data (e.g., professional associations) can create opportunities for users to strengthen their social and professional ties. However, the same data can also be used against the user for viral marketing and other unsolicited purposes. The invasion of privacy occurs due to privacy unawareness and carelessness of making information publicly available. In this paper, we perform a large-scale inference study in three of the currently most popular social networks: Foursquare, Google+ and Twitter. Our work focuses on inferring a user's home location, which may be a private attribute, for many users. We analyze whether a simple method can be used to infer the user home location using publicly available attributes and also the geographic information associated with locatable friends. We find that it is possible to infer the user home city with a high accuracy, around 67%, 72% and 82% of the cases in Foursquare, Google+ and Twitter, respectively. We also apply a finer-grained inference that reveals the geographic coordinates of the residence of a selected group of users in our datasets, achieving approximately up to 60% of accuracy within a radius of six kilometers. © 2012 IEEE.","Foursquare; Google+; Location; Location Inference; Privacy; Social Networks; Twitter","Data sets; Foursquare; Geographic coordinates; Geographic information; Google; Professional associations; SIMPLE method; Social media; Social Networks; Twitter; Viral marketing; Data mining; Data privacy; Location; Social networking (online)","Pontes, T.; Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: tpontes@dcc.ufmg.br",,,,9780769549255,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In view of the infeasibility of complete manual annotation, one seeks active learning methods for data organization, selection and prioritization that could help the user to label the samples. These methods, however, classify and reorganize the entire dataset at each iteration, and as the datasets grow, they become blatantly inefficient from the user's point of view. In this work, we propose an active learning paradigm which considerably reduces the non-annotated dataset into a small set of relevant samples for learning. During active learning, random samples are selected from this small learning set and the user annotates only the misclassified ones. A training set with new labelled samples increases at each iteration and improves the classifier for the next one. When the user is satisfied, the classifier can be used to annotate the rest of the dataset. To illustrate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we developed an instance based on the optimum path forest (OPF) classifier, while relying on clustering and classification for the learning process. By using this method, we were able to iteratively generate classifiers that improve quickly, to require few iterations, and to attain high accuracy while keeping user involvement to a minimum. We also show that the method provides better accuracies on unseen test sets with less user involvement than a baseline approach based on the OPF classifier and random selection of training samples from the entire dataset.","Active learning; Data mining; Machine learning; Optimum-path forest classifiers; Pattern recognition; Semi-automatic dataset annotation","Active Learning; Active learning methods; Amount of information; Data organization; Manual annotation; Optimum-path forests; Semi-automatics; User involvement; Computer graphics; Data mining; Forestry; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; Visualization; Classification (of information); Classification; Computer Graphics; Data Processing; Forestry; Information Retrieval","Institute of Computing, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,,,9788086943794,,,"English","Int.

However, despite the fact that COBIT 5 highlights such processes that consider the external environment, it misses to integrate them; moreover, it lacks a knowledge perspective. Therefore, we propose an adaptation to the COBIT framework to apply competitive intelligence on its processes. This would allow the organization to be proactive (rather than reactive) against external changes.

A principled ontology-driven approach typically relies on the definition of a domain ontology and its use in subsequent phases of information system design and integration. Many of the challenges in the application of such an approach are related to addressing ontological concerns (defining the nature of phenomena of interest) and addressing information modeling concerns (defining the information demand about the phenomena of interest). In this paper we argue that ontological concerns should be clearly separated from information modeling concerns. We have observed that ontology-based approaches and information modeling approaches have been treated mostly in isolation, with the consequence that the relation between a domain ontology and an information model is still in need of clarification, despite the efforts of the formal ontology and information modeling communities. We strive to provide the initial steps for a principled two-level approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns is used as a starting point for the definition of an information model, according to a certain information demand. We identify some important decisions that should guide the construction of information models. © 2012 IEEE.","Information modeling; Ontology-driven conceptual modeling; Ontology-driven information systems design","Conceptual modeling; Domain ontologies; Formal ontology; Information demand; Information Modeling; Information models; Model driven approach; Ontology-based; Two-level approach; Data mining; Industry; Information systems; Information theory; Systems analysis; Ontology","Carraretto, R.; Ontology and Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO), Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Vitória, ES, Brazil; email: rc.carraretto@gmail.com",,,,9780769547862,,,"English","Proc.

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as 'Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?', 'What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?' and 'How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?'. In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data sets with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We employ such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with twenty-two data sets and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5%) for the most balanced distributions up to 10% of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20% for 1% of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the sampling algorithms only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically about 30\% or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by random over-sampling and SMOTE. © 2012 IEEE.","Class imbalance; experimental setup; sampling methods","Class distributions; Class imbalance; Experimental evaluation; experimental setup; Learning paradigms; Open-ended questions; Over sampling; Performance loss; Real data sets; Research communities; Sampling algorithm; Sampling method; Treatment methods; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Recovery; Statistics; Learning algorithms","Batista, G.; Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil; email: gbatista@icmc.usp.br",,,,9780769549132,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In this study, the SVR models had been introduced and developed to predict body and carcass-related characteristics of 2 strains of broiler chicken. To evaluate the prediction ability of SVR models, we compared their performance with that of neural network (NN) models. Evaluation of the prediction accuracy of models was based on the R2, MS error, and bias. The variables of interest as model output were BW, empty BW, carcass, breast, drumstick, thigh, and wing weight in 2 strains of Ross and Cobb chickens based on intake dietary nutrients, including ME (kcal/bird per week), CP, TSAA, and Lys, all as grams per bird per week. A data set composed of 64 measurements taken from each strain were used for this analysis, where 44 data lines were used for model training, whereas the remaining 20 lines were used to test the created models. The results of this study revealed that it is possible to satisfactorily estimate the BW and carcass parts of the broiler chickens via their dietary nutrient intake. Through statistical criteria used to evaluate the performance of the SVR and NN models, the overall results demonstrate that the discussed models can be effective for accurate prediction of the body and carcass-related characteristics investigated here. However, the SVR method achieved better accuracy and generalization than the NN method. This indicates that the new data mining technique (SVR model) can be used as an alternative modeling tool for NN models. However, further reevaluation of this algorithm in the future is suggested. © 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.","Carcass characteristics; Neural network; Support vector regression","animal; article; artificial neural network; biological model; body composition; breeding; chicken; genetics; physiology; Animals; Body Composition; Breeding; Chickens; Models, Biological; Neural Networks (Computer); Aves; Gallus gallus","Faridi, A.; Center of Excellence in the Animal Sciences Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, 91775-1163 Mashhad, Iran; email: ako_faridi@yahoo.com",,,00325791,,,"23155042","English","Poult.

There are many issues that make difficult the complete elucidation of the relationship between these mutations and drug resistance, such as cross resistance and the limitations to detect the relevance of resistance. Look up tables and rule-based systems are an attempt to classify sequences and predict treatment failure. However, they depend on the scientific literature and their quality and reliability. Data-intensive analysis of HIV mutation databases may help to corroborate or to improve such knowledge spread in the literature. Pattern recognition algorithms classify data extracting information from different data domain. Clustering and biclustering classification algorithms have been explored to group scientific and business data based on measures of similarities. K-means is a popular algorithm for clustering and Bimax is used with binary data. Considering this scenario, the main contribution of this work is to develop a new methodology based on K-means and Bimax using a binary data representation of reverse transcriptase and protease sequences, in an attempt to get an unsupervised classification of the sequences that may be related to drug resistance. In our work, 14,393 sequences with selected positions of the proteins, known to be related to drug resistance, represented in an 82-dimensional vector space are analyzed by pattern recognition algorithms. The sequences are represented as binary vectors. Suitable visualization of such vectors is produced for medical interpretation and indicates some correspondence to the prediction of drug resistance given by the brazilian look up table, used by brazilian physicians, but that depends on the literature on HIV and it's quality to be created. As a consequence, in this work we describe a methodology based on the application of pattern recognition algorithms using binary data in order to suggest clusters of mutations and their relations with drug resistance using a different cluster visualization scheme. ©2012 IEEE.","Biclustering; Clustering; Drug resistance; HIV","Bi-clustering; Binary data; Binary vectors; Business data; Classification algorithm; Cluster visualization; Clustering; Cross resistance; Data domains; Data-intensive analysis; Drug resistance; Extracting information; HIV; HIV patients; K-means; Look up table; Pattern recognition algorithms; Reverse transcriptases; Scientific literature; Treatment failure; Unsupervised classification; Binary sequences; Data mining; Data visualization; Distance measurement; Pattern recognition; Visualization; Clustering algorithms","Cintho, M.; Departamento de Ciência da Computação - DCC, Instituto de Matemática e Estatística - IME, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Rua do Matão, 1010, CEP 05508-090 - São Paulo, SP, Brazil",,,,9781467344678,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This is due to the great popularization of devices equipped with image capture, such as digital cameras, smartphones and tablets. Moreover, the image files generated by those devices are easily spread out on the Web through social networking sites. Typically, the photos stored in these repositories bear valuable metadata, such as, geographic coordinates, timestamp, and camera orientation. This information can be used for many interesting data mining tasks, such as detection of points-of-interest (POIs) and trip planning. This paper introduces Compass Clustering, a new clustering algorithm for detecting POIs in georeferenced and oriented photo repositories. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches for POI detection cluster photos based solely on their geographic proximity. However, in many cases, the POIs are within a certain distance from the point where the photo was taken, that is, not in the exact camera location but in the direction it is pointing to, and thus many photos would be erroneously classified by existing methods. Therefore, we propose to exploit the camera orientation in order to identify more reliable POIs that reflect the real intention of people when taking photos. We evaluated our approach on a collection of more than 8,000 georeferenced and oriented photos collected from Flickr. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

This paper focuses on the first track challenge, which goal is to implement 19 queries with the highest throughput and the lowest latency, using a scalable parallel paradigm. In the input database, there are 265 millions of relations among more than 60 millions of users and more than 400 millions sent messages. This paper formalizes the logical model of the relationship in order to present the queries in precise and simple manner. Some optimization techniques were also proposed, such as the aggregate-rank-delete procedures, which can be applied to some of the queries for improving the performance.

Aiming to identify the orientation of user postings, several sentiment analysis techniques have been proposed - mainly based on text analysis. We propose here a different perspective to treat this problem, based on a user centric approach. We adopt a graph representation in which nodes represent users and connections represent their relationships in social networks. When available, the user opinion orientation is used to tag the user node. Then, we apply link mining techniques to infer opinions of users who have not posted their opinion about the subject under analysis. Preliminary experiments on a Twitter corpus of political preferences have shown promising results. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

On the other hand, this popularity has also attracted the attention of criminals, raising the number of fraud cases in Web and financial losses that reach billions of dollars per year. This paper proposes a methodology, based on the knowledge discovery process, to detect fraud in online payment systems. In order to evaluate this methodology we define the concept of economical efficiency and applied it to an actual dataset of one of the largest Latin American electronic payment systems.

Each edge has assigned a different cost, to be paid for testing it. Testing an edge e reveals in which component of T - e lies the vertex to be identified. We give a complete characterization of the computational complexity of this problem with respect to both tree diameter and degree. In particular, we show that it is strongly NP-hard to compute a minimum cost decision tree for weighted trees of diameter at least 6, and for trees having degree three or more. For trees of diameter five or less, we give a polynomial time algorithm. Moreover, for the degree 2 case, we significantly improve the straightforward O(n3) dynamic programming approach, and provide an O(n2) time algorithm.

In scenarios where an ontology conceptually describes the contents of a data repository, this provides valuable information for the purpose of semantic data integration which, in turn, is a fundamental issue for improving business intelligence. A basic, yet unsolved, issue in semantic data integration is how to ensure that only data related to the same real-world entity is merged. This requires that each concept is precisely defined into the ontology. From another perspective, foundational ontologies describe very general concepts independent of a particular domain, and precisely define concept meta-properties so as to make the semantics of each concept in the ontology explicit. In this paper, we discuss how the use of foundational ontology can improve the precision of the ontology alignment, and illustrate some examples using the UFO foundational ontology. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Foundational ontologies; Ontology alignment; Semantic integration","Data repositories; Foundational ontologies; Ontology alignment; Real-world entities; Semantic data; Semantic integration; Semantics; Data mining","Padilha, N.F.; Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: natalia.padilha@uniriotec.br",,,03029743,9783642339981,,,"English","Lect.

Indeed, a given real world problem must often be studied at distinct scales in order to be solved. Most implementation solutions go either towards generalization (and/or virtualization of distinct scales) or towards linking entities of interest across scales. In this context, the possibility of maintaining the history of changes at each scale is another factor to be considered. This paper presents our solution to these issues, which accommodates all previous research on handling multiple scales into a unifying framework. Our solution builds upon a specific database version model - the multiversion MVDB - which has already been successfully implemented in several geospatial scenarios, being extended here to support multi-scale research. The paper also presents our implementation of of a framework based on the model to handle and keep track of multi-scale data evolution. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","database versions; multi-scale; MVDB model","Data evolution; Geo-spatial; Geo-spatial data; Multi-version; Multiple scale; Multiscales; Real-world problem; Version model; Virtualizations; Data mining; Research","Longo, J.S.C.; Institute of Computing (IC), University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil; email: joaosavio@lis.ic.unicamp.br",,,03029743,9783642339981,,,"English","Lect.

That is, a metamodel provides an abstract syntax to distinguish between valid and invalid models. Although the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model has been extensively researched, and various extensions and enhancements have been proposed, to the best of our knowledge, a metamodel for the EER model, based on the classical notation of Chen, has not been proposed yet. That is, we have found no evidence of a metamodel that gives a precise and expressive definition of constructors and constructions needed to create, interchange or transform valid EER models. With aim of overcoming these shortcoming, in this paper we propose an expressive metamodel for EER modeling, named EER MetaModel (EERMM), which provides a novel perspective for scientific researches and industrial applications that need an EER metamodel as a starting point.

Although rodents are reportedly considered the main reservoirs of leptospirosis, dogs may develop the disease, may become asymptomatic carriers and may be used as sentinels for disease epidemiology. The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) combined with spatial analysis techniques allows the mapping of the disease and the identification and assessment of health risk factors. Besides the use of GIS and spatial analysis, the technique of data mining, decision tree, can provide a great potential to find a pattern in the behavior of the variables that determine the occurrence of leptospirosis. The objective of the present study was to apply Geographical Information Systems and data prospection (decision tree) to evaluate the risk factors for canine leptospirosis in an area of Curitiba, PR. Materials, Methods & Results: The present study was performed on the Vila Pantanal, a urban poor community in the city of Curitiba. A total of 287 dog blood samples were randomly obtained house-by-house in a two-day sampling on January 2010. In addition, a questionnaire was applied to owners at the time of sampling. Geographical coordinates related to each household of tested dog were obtained using a Global Positioning System (GPS) for mapping the spatial distribution of reagent and non-reagent dogs to leptospirosis. For the decision tree, risk factors included results of microagglutination test (MAT) from the serum of dogs, previous disease on the household, contact with rats or other dogs, dog breed, outdoors access, feeding, trash around house or backyard, open sewer proximity and flooding. A total of 189 samples (about 2/3 of overall samples) were randomly selected for the training file and consequent decision rules. The remained 98 samples were used for the testing file. The seroprevalence showed a pattern of spatial distribution that involved all the Pantanal area, without agglomeration of reagent animals. In relation to data mining, from 189 samples used in decision tree, a total of 165 (87.3%) animal samples were correctly classified, generating a Kappa index of 0.413. A total of 154 out of 159 (96.8%) samples were considered non-reagent and were correctly classified and only 5/159 (3.2%) were wrongly identified. On the other hand, only 11 (36.7%) reagent samples were correctly classified, with 19 (63.3%) samples failing diagnosis. Discussion: The spatial distribution that involved all the Pantanal area showed that all the animals in the area are at risk of contamination by Leptospira spp. Although most samples had been classified correctly by the decision tree, a degree of difficulty of separability related to seropositive animals was observed, with only 36.7% of the samples classified correctly. This can occur due to the fact of seronegative animals number is superior to the number of seropositive ones, taking the differences in the pattern of variable behavior. The data mining helped to evaluate the most important risk factors for leptospirosis in an urban poor community of Curitiba. The variables selected by decision tree reflected the important factors about the existence of the disease (default of sewer, presence of rats and rubbish and dogs with free access to street).

With this, system operators must anticipate the load values in order to prepare the necessary corrective actions to operate the system with security. One of the possible actions is the purchase of energy consumption. Before, the operators of CELG - Goias Power Distribution Co. employ some empirical capabilities to predict the load.

Along the last 20 years many algorithms have been proposed as to solve this problem. However, it still remains a challenging issue because of the complexity and of the dimensionality of the protein conformational search space. In this article a first principle method which uses database information for the prediction of the 3-D structure of polypeptides is presented. The technique is based on the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) algorithm, implemented by a software tool introduced on this work. GMDH Polynomial Neural Networks have been used with success in many fields such as data mining, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition and prediction. The proposed method was tested with seven protein sequences whose sizes vary from 14 to 54 amino acid residues. Results show that the predicted tertiary structures adopt a fold similar to the experimental structures. RMSD and secondary structure analysis reveal that the proposed method present accurate results in their predictions. The predicted structures can be used as input structures in refinement methods based on molecular mechanics (MM), e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The search space is expected to be greatly reduced and the ab initio methods can demand a much reduced computational time to achieve a more accurate polypeptide structure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They are involved in numerous biological processes and show enormous biotechnological potential. Among plant lectins, the hevein domain is extremely common, being observed in several kinds of lectins. Moreover, this domain is also observed in an important class of antimicrobial peptides named hevein-like peptides. Due to higher cysteine residues conservation, hevein-like peptides could be mined among the sequence databases. By using the pattern CX(4,5)CC[GS]X(2)GXCGX[GST]X(2,3)[FWY]C[GS]X[AGS] novel hevein-like peptide precursors were found from three different plants: Oryza sativa, Vitis vinifera and Selaginella moellendorffii. In addition, an hevein-like peptide precursor from the phytopathogenic fungus Phaeosphaeria nodorum was also identified. The molecular models indicate that they have the same scaffold as others, composed of an antiparallel β-sheet and short helices. Nonetheless, the fungal hevein-like peptide probably has a different disulfide bond pattern. Despite this difference, the complexes between peptide and N,N,N-triacetylglucosamine are stable, according to molecular dynamics simulations. This is the first report of an hevein-like peptide from an organism outside the plant kingdom. The exact role of an hevein-like peptide in the fungal biology must be clarified, while in plants they are clearly involved in plant defense. In summary, data here reported clear shows that an in silico strategy could lead to the identification of novel hevein-like peptides that could be used as biotechnological tools in the fields of health and agribusiness. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Data mining; Fungal hevein-like peptide; Hevein domain; Molecular dynamics simulation; Molecular modeling; Regular expression","glucosamine; hevein; hevein like peptide precursor; n,n,n triacetylglucosamine; unclassified drug; article; beta sheet; complex formation; computer model; data base; disulfide bond; fungus; fungus identification; grape; molecular dynamics; molecular model; nonhuman; Phaeosphaeria nodorum; plant defense; priority journal; protein analysis; protein domain; protein structure; rice; Selaginella; Selaginella moellendorffii; sequence analysis; simulation; Acetylglucosamine; Amino Acid Sequence; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Ascomycota; Computer Simulation; Databases, Protein; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Molecular Sequence Data; Oryza sativa; Plant Lectins; Plant Proteins; Protein Conformation; Protein Precursors; Selaginellaceae; Vitis; Fungi; Oryza sativa; Phaeosphaeria nodorum; Selaginella moellendorffii; Vitis vinifera","Franco, O.L.; Centro de Análises Proteômicas e Bioquímicas, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências Genômicas e Biotecnologia, Universidade Católica de Brasília, Brasília DF, Brazil; email: ocfranco@gmail.com",,,01969781,,PPTDD,"22981805","English","Peptides",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866280179

Next generation sequencing provides both astounding opportunities and challenges, especially for genetic counsellors. An approach coordinated at a genome wide, international level, supported by well-organized disease-specific respected organizations is a model most likely to be successful, but committed resourceful professionals working in local poorly resourced environments can make valuable contributions that can grow. Bioinformatic tools to sift and integrate multiple domains of information are being developed, and play a major part in meeting the challenges. Regulation of providers, including a requirement for them to submit mutational information to central databases, also should assist to reach the goals needed to realize the opportunities. There is also a need to agree on governance of Locus-Specific Databases (LSDBs) at an international level, and for adequate international funding to support this need, to ensure humanity reaps the benefits of the current molecular genetic revolution.

The contributions here are two-fold: firstly, we revisit two classical Derivation Patterns and prove a number of results that can be used to infer the modal meta-properties of Derived Types from those of the types participating in the associated derivation rules; secondly, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in the automated support for model construction in OntoUML. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Derived Object Types; Meta-Properties; Ontological Foundations","Automated support; Conceptual modeling; Conceptual modeling languages; Derivation rules; Derived Object Types; Evaluation methodologies; Meta-Properties; Model construction; Ontological foundation; Ontology engineering; Data mining; Information systems; Systems engineering; Ontology","Guizzardi, G.; Ontology and Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO), Computer Science Department, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)Brazil; email: gguizzardi@inf.ufes.br",,,03029743,9783642310942,,,"English","Lect.

Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because AGMI presented many association rules that provided a 90% correct identification of cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection, prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement processes. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A prominent Artificial Intelligence research area is automatic programming - the generation of a computer program by another computer program. Clustering is an important data mining task with many useful real-world applications. Particularly, the class of clustering algorithms based on the idea of data density to identify clusters has many advantages, such as the ability to identify arbitrary-shape clusters. We propose the use of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for the artificial generation of density-based clustering algorithms. In order to guarantee the generation of valid algorithms, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) was defined where each node represents a procedure (building block) and each edge represents a possible execution sequence between two nodes. The Building Blocks DAG specifies the alphabet of the EDA, that is, any possibly generated algorithm. Preliminary experimental results compare the clustering algorithms artificially generated by AutoClustering to DBSCAN, a well-known manually-designed algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.","Automatic Programming; Data Mining; Density-Based Clustering; Estimation of Distribution Algorithms","Artificial intelligence research; Automatic Generation; Building blockes; Data density; Data mining algorithm; Data mining tasks; Density-based Clustering; Density-based clustering algorithms; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Estimation of distribution algorithms; Execution sequences; Human programmers; Real-world application; Artificial intelligence; Automatic programming; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Clustering algorithms","Meiguins, A.S.G.; PPGEE - UFPA, Belém, Brazil",,,,9781467315098,,,"English","IEEE Congr.

A vehicle departs loaded from the depot, visit every customer delivering a certain amount of goods according to their demand, and optionally pickup items from those customers, receiving a profit for each pickup realized. The vehicle has a limited capacity, which may turn impossible to attend all pickups, or make this unprofitable if it has to come back later in the customer after unloaded enough to fit the pickup demand. The objective is to find a minimal cost feasible route, the cost being the total travel costs minus the total revenue earned with pickups. Despite the many real applications, the literature is scarce. We propose an evolutionary algorithm whose crossover and mutation operators use data mining strategies to capture good characteristics from the parents and the population. Solutions are improved by a VNS algorithm during the process, and new solutions are introduced regularly to avoid premature convergence, using good constructive algorithms.

Typically, two classes of features are extracted from mammograms with these algorithms, namely morphological and non-morphological features. Image texture analysis is an important technique that represents gray level properties of images used to describe non-morphological features. This technique has shown to be a promising technique in analyzing mammographic lesions caused by masses. In this paper, we evaluate texture classification using features derived from co-occurrence matrices, wavelet and ridgelet transforms of mammographic images. In particular, we propose a false positive reduction in computer-aided detection of masses. The data set consisted of 120 cranio-caudal mammograms, half containing a mass, rated as abnormal images, and half with no lesions. The following texture descriptors were then calculated to analyze the regions of interest (ROIs) texture patterns: entropy, energy, sum average, sum variance, and cluster tendency. To select the best set of features for each method, we applied a genetic algorithm (GA). In the ROIs classification stage, we used the Random Forest algorithm, a data mining technique that separates the data into non-overlapping segments. Experimental results showed that the best classification rates were obtained with the wavelet-based feature extraction using GA for selection of the most relevant features, giving an AUC = 0.90. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible. © 2012 ACM.","lower bounds; similarity search; time series","Academic work; Arrival rates; Data sets; Data stream; Dynamic time warping; Euclidean distance; Large datasets; Lower bounds; Massive data sets; Motif discovery; Powered devices; Real time monitoring; Search Algorithms; Similarity search; Time series data mining; Time series subsequences; Time-series experiments; Algorithms; Time series; Data mining","Rakthanmanon, T.; UC RiversideUnited States; email: rakthant@cs.ucr.edu",,,,9781450314626,,,"English","Proc.

However, there are several ways to be influential, for example, to be the most popular or the first that adopts a new idea. In this paper we present a methodology to find trendsetters in information networks according to a specific topic of interest. Trendsetters are people that adopt and spread new ideas influencing other people before these ideas become popular. At the same time, not all early adopters are trendsetters because only few of them have the ability of propagating their ideas by their social contacts through word-of-mouth. Differently from other influence measures, a trendsetter is not necessarily popular or famous, but the one whose ideas spread over the graph successfully. Other metrics such as node in-degree or even standard Pagerank focus only in the static topology of the network. We propose a ranking strategy that focuses on the ability of some users to push new ideas that will be successful in the future. To that end, we combine temporal attributes of nodes and edges of the network with a Pagerank based algorithm to find the trendsetters for a given topic. To test our algorithm we conduct innovative experiments over a large Twitter dataset. We show that nodes with high in-degree tend to arrive late for new trends, while users in the top of our ranking tend to be early adopters that also influence their social contacts to adopt the new trend. © 2012 ACM.","influence; information networks; social networks","Data sets; In-Degree; influence; Information diffusion; Information networks; Innovative experiments; PageRank; Ranking strategy; Social Networks; Temporal attributes; Algorithms; Data mining; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Information services","Saez-Trumper, D.; Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; email: diego.saez@upf.edu",,,,9781450314626,,,"English","Proc.

The database was developed using Apache Webserver 2.1.6 and SGBD MySQL. The webpage interfaces were developed in HTML and sever-side scripting written in PHP. The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database is hosted on the Gonçalo Moniz/FIOCRUZ Research Center server. There are currently 2,457 registered sequences with 2,024 (82.37%) of those sequences representing unique isolates. Of these sequences, 803 (39.67%) contain information about clinical status (TSP/HAM, 17.19%; ATL, 7.41%; asymptomatic, 12.89%; other diseases, 2.17%; and no information, 60.32%). Further, 7.26% of sequences contain information on patient gender while 5.23% of sequences provide the age of the patient.Background: It is estimated that 15 to 20 million people are infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). At present, there are more than 2,000 unique HTLV-1 isolate sequences published. A central database to aggregate sequence information from a range of epidemiological aspects including HTLV-1 infections, pathogenesis, origins, and evolutionary dynamics would be useful to scientists and physicians worldwide. Described here, we have developed a database that collects and annotates sequence data and can be accessed through a user-friendly search interface. The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database website is available at http://htlv1db.bahia.fiocruz.br/.Conclusions/Significance: The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database retrieves and stores annotated HTLV-1 proviral sequences from clinical, epidemiological, and geographical studies. The collected sequences and related information are now accessible on a publically available and user-friendly website.

Once this structure is built, it is necessary to find labels for each of the obtained clusters. In many cases the labels must be built using all the terms in the documents of the collection. This paper presents the SeCLAR method, which explores the use of association rules in the selection of good candidates for labels of hierarchical document clusters. The purpose of this method is to select a subset of terms by exploring the relationship among the terms of each document. Thus, these candidates can be processed by a classical method to generate the labels. An experimental study demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach to improve the precision and recall of labels obtained by classical methods only considering the terms which are potentially more discriminative. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

It has also made another important attempt to increase the number of places by approving regulations to legalize the release of the places occupied by retained students for new students. According to these regulations' retention criteria, there were around 50% of places retained by these students. This Article presents a data mining approach for assessing the risk of undergraduate student retention at the end of the second semester of course aiming at supporting the counseling of students to prevent their retention. The approach has been developed for the Federal University of Pernambuco, focusing on 6 of its major courses which involved data transformation from a database of over 400,000 subjects records, the application of logistic regression for risk assessment, and induction of rules for explaining that risk at the counseling process. The risk estimation solution reached Max-KS=0.51 and AUC-ROC=0.84 in performance. Three scenarios of 30%, 50% and 70% of efficacy in the counseling process show that the procedure should be implemented and is economically viable with decision threshold and return of investment varying according to that efficacy. © 2012 IEEE.","a priori; data mining; logistic regression; student evasion; student retention","a priori; Data transformation; Decision threshold; Logistic regressions; Pernambuco; Public universities; Return of investments; Risk estimation; Student retention; Undergraduate students; Data mining; Economics; Logistics; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Students","Da Silva, H.R.B.; Center for Informatics, UFPE - Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil; email: hrbs@cin.ufpe.br",,,,9781467314909,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865085846

Data sets under analysis are no longer only static databases, but also data streams in which concepts and data distributions may not be stable over time. However, most learning algorithms produced so far are based on the assumption that data comes from a fixed distribution, so they are not suitable to handle concept drifts. Moreover, some concept drifts applications requires fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re)trained with the latest available data. But the process of labeling data is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to unlabeled data acquisition, thus only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are also based on the assumption that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenge in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach was used to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. In this paper, we extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm using a single classifier, which naturally adapts to concept changes, without any explicit drift detection mechanism. Its built-in mechanisms provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually forgetting older knowledge as older labeled data items became less influent on the classification of newer data items. Some computer simulation are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.","Concept Drift; Machine learning; Particle Competition and Cooperation; Semi-Supervised Learning","Competition and cooperation; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Data items; Data sets; Data stream; Detection mechanism; Fast response; Graph-based; Labeled and unlabeled data; Labeled data; Semi-supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning methods; Training process; Computer simulation; Data communication systems; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Supervised learning","Breve, F.; São Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazil; email: fabricio@rc.unesp.br",,,,9781467314909,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865065341

This paper introduces a granular neural network framework for evolving fuzzy system modeling from fuzzy data streams. The evolving granular neural network (eGNN) efficiently handles concept changes, distinctive events of nonstationary environments. eGNN constructs interpretable multi-sized local models using fuzzy neural information fusion. An incremental learning algorithm builds the neural network topology from the information contained in data streams. Here we emphasize fuzzy intervals and objects with trapezoidal membership functions. Triangular fuzzy numbers, intervals, and numeric data are particular instances of trapezoids. An example concerning weather time series forecasting illustrates the neural network performance. The goal is to extract, from monthly temperature data, information of interest to attain accurate one-step forecasts and better rapport with reality. Simulation results suggest that eGNN learns from fuzzy data successfully and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Data stream; Evolving Fuzzy Systems; Fuzzy data; Fuzzy interval; Fuzzy time series; Fuzzy-neural; Incremental learning; Local model; Neural network topology; Non-stationary environment; Numeric data; State-of-the-art approach; Temperature data; Time series forecasting; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Data communication systems; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Network performance; Neural networks; Time series; Weather forecasting","Leite, D.; Department of Computer Engineering and Automation, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Campinas, 13083-852, Brazil; email: danfl7@dca.fee.unicamp.br",,,,9781467314909,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865067907

In this paper we propose the use of a novel algorithm for clustering data that we call hybrid particle swarm optimization with mutation (HPSOM), which is based on PSO. The HPSOM basically uses PSO and incorporates the mutation process often used in GA to allow the search to escape from local optima. It is shown how the PSO/HPSOM can be used to find the centroids of a user-specified number of clusters. The new algorithm is evaluated on five benchmark data sets. The proposed method is compared with the K-means (KM) clustering technique and the standard PSO algorithm. The results show that the algorithm is efficient and produces compact clusters. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Data Cluster; Data Mining; Hybrid PSO; PSO","Application area; Benchmark data; Bioinformatics data; Clustering data; Clustering techniques; Data clustering; Data clusters; Data mining tasks; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Hybrid PSO; K-means; Local optima; Mutation process; Novel algorithm; Number of clusters; PSO; Standard PSO; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Clustering algorithms","Esmin, A.A.A.; Department of Computer Science, University of Lavras (UFLA), Lavras, MG 37200-000, Brazil; email: ahmed@dcc.ufla.br",,,03029743,9783642326387,,,"English","Lect.

In order to implement the diversity index, it is necessary to define the element that will represent the species in the image. So, in the first approach, the intensities of the pixels of the image are treated as species, and the texture statistic used is the histogram. Considering the spatial relations of direction and distance between pixels, we adopted a second approach, using GLCM as texture statistic, where the species are represented by pairs of pixels, and the third approach, using GLRLM as texture statistic, where the species are represented by gray level run lengths.

It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no significant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is significantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no significant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain. Additionally, datasets' density-based metrics proposed here probably capture some aspects of the VC dimension on decision trees and low-density datasets may require large capacity machines whilst the opposite also seems to be true. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Number of Trees; Random Forest; VC Dimension","Biomedical domain; Computational costs; Computational environments; Computationally efficient; Data sets; Density-based; Diverse domains; Large datasets; Low density; Number of Trees; Optimal number; Performance Gain; Random forests; Real-world application; VC dimension; Data mining; Decision trees; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Research; Forestry; Algorithms; Data Processing; Decision Making; Research; Trees","Oshiro, T.M.; Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Languages at Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao PauloBrazil; email: thaismayumi@usp.br",,,03029743,9783642315367,,,"English","Lect.

In this work we are interested in the application of graph mining to identify abnormal behavior patterns from telecom Call Detail Records (CDRs). Such behaviors could also be used to model essential business tasks in telecom, for example churning, fraud, or marketing strategies, where the number of customers is typically quite large. Therefore, it is important to rank the most interesting patterns for further analysis. We propose a vertex relevant ranking score as a unified measure for focusing the search of abnormal patterns in weighted call graphs based on CDRs. Classical graph-vertex measures usually expose a quantitative perspective of vertices in telecom call graphs. We aggregate wellknown vertex measures for handling attribute-based information usually provided by CDRs. Experimental evaluation carried out with real data streams, from a local mobile telecom company, showed us the feasibility of the proposed strategy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Abnormal behavior; Abnormal patterns; Call detail records; Call graphs; Chemical informatics; Data stream; Experimental evaluation; Graph mining; Marketing strategy; Mobile telecom; Model complexes; Relevant vertex; Telecom; Telecom call graph; Web analysis; Bioinformatics; Chemical analysis; Global system for mobile communications; Telecommunication; Telecommunication systems; Data mining","Alves, R.; Vale Technological Institute Sustainable DevelopmentBrazil; email: ronnie.alves@vale.com",,,03029743,9783642314872,,,"English","Lect.

To this end, two major techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map sugarcane, whereas DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. To derive the image objects, the segmentation algorithm implemented in Definiens Developer® was used. The data mining algorithm used was J48, which generates decision trees (DT) from a previously prepared training set. The study area comprises three municipalities located in the northwest of São Paulo state, all of which are good representatives of the agricultural conditions in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. A time series of Landsat TM and ETM + images was acquired in order to represent the wide range of pattern variation along the sugarcane crop cycle. After training, the DT was applied to the Landsat time series, thus generating the desired thematic map with sugarcane ready to harvest. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. Using error matrix analysis and Kappa statistics, tests for statistical significance were derived. The statistics indicated that the classification achieved an overall accuracy of 94% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.87. Results show that the combination of OBIA and DM techniques is very efficient and promising for the sugarcane classification process. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Data Mining (DM); Decision tree; Image segmentation; Landsat; Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA); Sugarcane; Time-series imagery","Agricultural conditions; Classification accuracy; Classification process; Data mining algorithm; Definiens; Error matrices; Image objects; Kappa coefficient; Kappa statistic; Knowledge model; LANDSAT; LANDSAT TM; Object based image analysis; Pattern variation; Remotely sensed imagery; Segmentation algorithms; Statistical significance; Study areas; Sugarcane crops; Thematic maps; Time-series imagery; Training sets; Algorithms; Decision trees; Error statistics; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Maps; Remote sensing; Sugar cane; Time series; Data mining; data mining; error analysis; image analysis; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; satellite imagery; segmentation; sugar cane; time series; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]","Formaggio, A.R.; National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Avenida dos Astronautas 1758, São José dos Campos, SP 12227-010, Brazil; email: formag@dsr.inpe.br",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

This phase is crucial for a good data mining result because if data is not correctly prepared, all the next phases of the process are compromised.

This paper presents a comparison between DMPML and three data mining applications (Weka, RapidMiner, and KNIME) that implement the directed graph approach, concerning the time spent to create and execute the data preparation tasks for two data mining algorithms. The tests were executed using different types of data sets: numerical, categorical, and mixed.

Also the proposed method mines association rules, while the previous ones produce frequent sequences, adding the semantic information of confidence, which was not previously defined by sequential patterns. Experiments were conducted with real data collected from climate sensors. The results showed that the proposed method increases the number of mined patterns when compared with the traditional sequential mining, revealing related events that occur over time.

The mechanism that the human immune system uses to detect and protect from organisms that threaten the human body is efficient and can be adapted to detect malware attacks. In this paper we propose a system to perform malware distributed collection, analysis and detection, this last inspired by the human immune system. After collecting malware samples from Internet, they are dynamically analyzed so as to provide execution traces at the operating system level and network flows that are used to create a behavioral model and to generate a detection signature. Those signatures serve as input to a malware detector, acting as the antibodies in the antigen detection process. This allows us to understand the malware attack and aids in the infection removal procedures. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","data mining; human immune system; malicious code","Antigen detections; Behavioral model; Execution trace; Human bodies; Human immune systems; Malicious codes; Malware attacks; Malware detection; Malwares; Network flows; Chemical detection; Computer aided network analysis; Computer crime; Data mining; Detectors; Network security; Immunology","De Oliveira, I.L.; São Paulo State University (Unesp), São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil; email: isabela@acmesecurity.org",,,03029743,9783642311277,,,"English","Lect.

The area of text mining aims at discovering knowledge from data of this type. Most work in this area uses the model known as bag of words to represent the texts. This form of representation, although effective, minimizes the quality of knowledge discovered because it is not able to capture essential characteristics of this type of data such as semantics and context. The paradigm of granular computing has been shown effective in the treatment of complex problems of information processing and can produce significant results in large-scale environments such as the Web. This paper explores the granulation process of words with a view to its application in the subsequent improvement in text representation. We use fuzzy relations and spectral clustering in this process and present some results. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","fuzzy relation; granular computing; spectral clustering","Bag of words; Complex problems; Essential characteristic; Fuzzy relations; Semi-structured; Spectral clustering; Text mining; Text representation; Data mining; Granular computing; Granulation; Semantics; Knowledge representation","Castro, P.F.; Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computação, COPPE/UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: patfiuza@cos.ufrj.br",,,03029743,9783642311277,,,"English","Lect.

The treatment of this vast amount of texts by means of Text Mining (TM) techniques has produced interesting information in fields like Competitive Intelligence and Bibliometry that need to make sense from textual descriptions of facts. In this paper we approach the problem of taxonomy generation from texts, a common need from a large set of scientific disciplines. Taxonomy generation refers to building a hierarchical structure that organizes concepts in a knowledge domain. We applied TM techniques to help experts in Pedology in building taxonomy from redundant soils descriptions. The motto of the application is the fact that, in the early eighties, different organizations mapped and described equivalent classes of soils from Brazilian savannas, generating redundant descriptions with different class labels. There were produced 28 soil maps that covered 4,101 descriptions of soil classes. This profusion of redundant soil descriptions clearly represents a Babel Tower that makes difficult tasks like environment management and food production. The proposed process is based in clustering analysis and runs on the soil descriptions, performing a successive refinement of the abstractions found in soil descriptions. The method builds a frame that shows, for each cluster formed, the prototype (a representative word vector) and the soil descriptions related to that cluster. The results have been analyzed by a team of experts as input information to the laborious reasoning process involved in building concepts from the semantic relations among the soil descriptions. Without a help like the present process, the experts would have to compare visually at least 4,101 x 4.100 x ... x 1 soil descriptions to define the clusters, what is much more laborious. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Soil Science; Taxonomies; Text Mining","Bibliometry; Class labels; Clustering analysis; Environment management; Equivalent class; Food production; Hierarchical structures; In-buildings; In-field; Interesting information; Knowledge domains; Reasoning process; Scientific discipline; Semantic relations; Soil class; Soil maps; Soil science; Successive refinement; Taxonomy generation; Text mining; Textual description; Agriculture; Competition; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Equivalence classes; Semantics; Taxonomies; Soils","Do Prado, H.A.; Graduate Program on Knowledge and IT Management, Catholic University of Brasilia, SGAN 916 Av.

A methodology for the study of the area covered by mangroves at the northern portion of the city was proposed to identify the main targets of this area, such as: marsh areas (known locally as <i>Apicum</i>), mangrove forests, tidal channels, blockhouses (irregular constructions), embankments, paved streets and different condominiums. Initially a databank including information on the main types of occupation and environments was established for the area under study. An image fusion (multispectral bands with panchromatic band) was done, to improve the information content of WorldView-2 data. Following an ortho-rectification was made with the dataset used, in order to compare with cartographical data from the municipality, using Ground Control Points (GCPs) collected during field survey. Using the data mining software GEODMA, a series of attributes which characterize the targets of interest was established. Afterwards the classes were structured, a knowledge model was created and the classification performed. The OBIA approach eased mapping of such sensitive areas, showing the irregular occupations and embankments of mangrove forests, reducing its area and damaging the marine biodiversity.","High-resolution images; Highresolution images; Irregular occupation; Mangrove; Object-based Image Analysis; Urban area.; WorldView-2",,"Kux, H.J.H.; INPE Andndash; National Institute for Space Research, Avenida Dos Astronautas, 1758 andndash; Jardim da Granja, Brazil; email: hermann@dsr.inpe.br","Shortis M.Madden M.","Copernicus GmbH",21949042,,,,"English","ISPRS Ann.

The aim of this paper is to quantitatively check priority areas in order to combat deforestation on the Amazon forest, using the space-time scan statistic. The study area location is at the south of the Amazonas State and cover around 297.183 kilometre squares, including the municipality of Boca do Acre, Labrea, Canutama, Humaita, Manicore, Novo Aripuana e Apui County on the north region of Brazil. This area has showed a significant change for land cover, which has increased the number of deforestation's alerts. Therefore this situation becomes a concern and gets more investigation, trying to stop factors that increase the number of cases in the area. The methodology includes the location and year that deforestation's alert occurred. These deforestation's alerts are mapped by the DETER (Detection System of Deforestation in Real Time in Amazonia), which is carry out by the Brazilian Space Agency (INPE). The software SatScanTM v7.0 was used in order to define space-time permutation scan statistic for detection of deforestation cases. The outcome of this experiment shows an efficient model to detect space-time clusters of deforestation's alerts. The model was efficient to detect the location, the size, the order and characteristics about activities at the end of the experiments. Two clusters were considered actives and kept actives up to the end of the study. These clusters are located in Canutama and Lábrea County. This quantitative spatial modelling of deforestation warnings allowed: firstly, identifying actives clustering of deforestation, in which the environment government official are able to concentrate their actions; secondly, identifying historic clustering of deforestation, in which the environment government official are able to monitoring in order to avoid them to became actives again; and finally, verify that distances between the deforestation warning and the roads explain part of the significant clustering.","Change Detection; Data Mining; Forestry; Remote Sensing; Spatial; Statistics",,"Vieira, C.A.O.; Dept.

As for soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merril], one of the most important crop species in the world, the situation is not different. In order to deal with these stresses, plants have evolved a variety of sophisticated molecular mechanisms, to which the transcriptional regulation of target-genes by transcription factors is crucial. Even though the involvement of several transcription factor families has been widely reported in stress response, there still is a lot to be uncovered, especially in soybean. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of bHLH and trihelix-GT transcription factors in soybean responses to environmental stresses. Gene annotation, data mining for stress response, and phylogenetic analysis of members from both families are presented herein. At least 45 bHLH (from subgroup 25) and 63 trihelix-GT putative genes reside in the soybean genome. Among them, at least 14 bHLH and 11 trihelix-GT seem to be involved in responses to abiotic/biotic stresses. Phylogenetic analysis successfully clustered these with members from other plant species. Nevertheless, bHLH and trihelix-GT genes encompass almost three times more members in soybean than in Arabidopsisor rice, with many of these grouping into new clades with no apparent near orthologs in the other analyzed species. Our results represent an important step towards unraveling the functional roles of plant bHLH and trihelix-GT transcription factors in response to environmental cues. 2012, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.","Drought; Gene expression; Glycine max; Phylogeny; Plant-microbe interactions","basic helix loop helix transcription factor; transcription factor; trihelix GT protein; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; transcription factor; trihelix gt transcription factor; abiotic stress; Arabidopsis; article; basic helix loop helix gene; biotic stress; cladistics; computer model; DNA sequence; environmental stress; gene function; gene identification; gene location; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; plant genome; plant response; plant stress; protein determination; protein function; rice; sequence analysis; soybean; species comparison; trihelix GT gene; unindexed sequence; abiotic stress; biotic stress; computer model; controlled study; data mining; molecular genetics; phylogeny; protein analysis; soybean; Glycine max","Margis-Pinheiro, M.; Departamento de Genética, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Caixa Postal 15053, 91501-970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; email: marcia.margis@ufrgs.br",,,14154757,,GMBIF,,"English","Genet.

The increasing production of sequence data has opened an opportunity to link information from mapping studies to the underlying sequences. Genome browsers are invaluable platforms that provide access to these sequences, including tools for genome analysis, allowing the integration of multivariate information, and thus aiding to explain the emergence of complex genomes. The present work presents a tutorial regarding the use of genome browsers to develop targeted physical mapping, providing also a general overview and examples about the possibilities regarding the use of Fluorescent In SituHybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), simple sequence repeats (SSR) and rDNA probes, highlighting the potential of such studies for map integration and comparative genetics. As a case study, the available genome of soybean was accessed to show how the physical andin silicodistribution of such sequences may be compared at different levels. Such evaluations may also be complemented by the identification of sequences beyond the detection level of cytological methods, here using members of the aquaporin gene family as an example. The proposed approach highlights the complementation power of the combination of molecular cytogenetics and computational approaches for the anchoring of coding or repetitive sequences in plant genomes using available genome browsers, helping in the determination of sequence location, arrangement and number of repeats, and also filling gaps found in computational pseudochromosome assemblies. © 2012, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.","Aquaporin; BAC; Bioinformatics; Fish; Gene families; SSR","aquaporin; ribosome DNA; aquaporin; ribosome DNA; algorithm; aquaporin gene; article; bacterial artificial chromosome; bioinformatics; chromosome map; comparative gene mapping; computer model; controlled study; data mining; DNA probe; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene location; gene locus; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic database; physical chemistry; plant gene; plant genome; process development; process optimization; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; simple sequence repeat; soybean; synteny; web browser; bacterial artificial chromosome; chromosome structure; computational fluid dynamics; cytogenetics; cytology; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; gene rearrangement; gene structure; genetic analysis; mining; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant chromosome; simple sequence repeat; soybean; web browser; Bacteria (microorganisms); Glycine max","Benko-Iseppon, A.

Nevertheless, AI applications have not been consolidated as standard solutions in the industry, and most common applications of AI still are case studies and pilot projects. In this work, an analysis of a survey conducted on a broad group of professionals related to several E&P operations and service companies is presented. This survey captures the level of AI knowledge in the industry, the most common application areas, and the expectations of the users from AI-based solutions. It also includes a literature review of technical papers related to AI applications and trends in the market and R&D. The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% of respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most impacted by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of AI technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles. This work aims to be a guide for personnel responsible for production and asset management on how AI-based applications can add more value and improve their decision making. It also illustrates how AI techniques will play an important role in future developments of IT solutions in the E&P industry.

As uncertain data prevail in stream applications, excessive data granularity becomes unnecessary and inefficient. This paper introduces an evolving fuzzy granular framework to learn from and model time-varying fuzzy input-output data streams. The fuzzy-set based evolving modeling framework consists of a one-pass learning algorithm capable to gradually develop the structure of rule-based models. This framework is particularly suitable to handle potentially unbounded fuzzy data streams and render singular and granular approximations of nonstationary functions. The main objective of this paper is to shed light into the role of evolving fuzzy granular computing in providing high-quality approximate solutions from large volumes of real-world online data streams. An application example in weather temperature prediction using actual data is used to evaluate and illustrate the usefulness of the modeling approach. The behavior of nonstationary fuzzy data streams with gradual and abrupt regime shifts is also verified in the realm of the weather temperature prediction. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Fuzzy data stream; Granular computing; Information granule; Online learning; Time series prediction","Application examples; Approximate solution; Data granularity; Data stream processing; Fuzzy data; Granular modeling; High quality; Input-output data; Modeling approach; Modeling frameworks; Nonstationary; One-pass; Online data; Online learning; Regime shift; Rule-based models; Stream application; Temperature prediction; Time series prediction; Time varying; Uncertain datas; Data communication systems; Data mining; Granular computing; Information granules; Learning algorithms; Weather forecasting","Leite, D.; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil; email: danfl7@dca.fee.unicamp.br",,,18686478,,,,"English","Evol.

Space flight is undoubtedly a human achievement of the second half of the 20th century, and probably the most audacious one of the past century. The space race started suddenly in the 1950s and has grown explosively during the following two decades, but decreased steadily after the 1970s. After the 1990s, however, we have seen a shy rebirth of space-related activities, when many other actors (states) entered the stage, adding up to the agonizing role of the two-actor piece that we have witnessed during the so-called Cold War. The opening years of the 21st century provided a more complex narrative for space exploration. At the start of the new millennium a new technosphere [1] emerged, dominated by what is used to be called as the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), with the Internet playing the leading role among the bandwagon of technological novelties that appeared during the twilight of space activities. In despite of the fact that artificial satellites represent the very backbone of the global communications system, space activities seem to play a secondary role amidst the apparently accelerated rate of change concerning the technological systems of the present technosphere. But, as it is demonstrated in this paper, things are changing, and very probably a renewed space race will unfold in the coming decades. A question may be placed: what happened? Why the Earth stood still with regard to the race toward the cosmos? Answer: futurists, even prestigious ones like Herman Kahn and Arthur Clarke, did not consider the existence of socioeconomic long waves (Kondratieff waves, or K-waves for short) with their two decades long economic downturn, which has contributed to the deceleration of space-related activities. Analyzing the worldwide evolving scenario of space-related activities during the last eighty years under the framework of the succeeding K-waves and applying some technological forecasting tools, namely the logistic analysis, technological surveillance and intensive data mining, scrutinizing more than 7500 events occurred in the period 1930-2010 related with space activities, it is demonstrated that the space race like the one that we have witnessed until now is a natural growth process that has saturated at the dawn of this century. The same analysis demonstrates that a new growth process in this field might be nowadays under way with contours very different from that imagined by futurists and science fiction writers sixty years ago. Also the main trends in the usage of launching vehicles and satellites are framed and discussed in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Data mining; Future scenarios; K-waves; Logistic analysis; Spaceflight","20th century; Cold wars; Economic downturn; Future scenarios; Global communication; Growth process; Information and communications technology; K-waves; Kondratieff waves; Launching vehicles; Logistic analysis; Long waves; Rate of change; Science fictions; Space activities; Space explorations; Technological system; Communication; Data mining; Economics; Network security; Space research; Technological forecasting; Space flight; data mining; information and communication technology; Internet; logistics; space technology","Devezas, T.; University of Beira Interior, Dept. of Electromechanics, Engineering Faculty Bdg 8, Ladeira do Lamego, P-6200-001, Covilhã, Portugal; email: tessalen@ubi.pt",,,00401625,,,,"English","Technol.

We want to quantify reciprocity between individuals in weighted networks, and we want to discover whether it depends on their topological features (like degree, or number of common neighbors). Here we answer these questions, by studying the call- and SMS records of millions of mobile phone users from a large city, with more than 0.5 billion phone calls and 60 million SMSs, exchanged over a period of six months. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose a novel distribution, the Triple Power Law (3PL), that fits the reciprocity behavior of all 3 datasets we study, with a better fit than older competitors, (2) 3PL is parsimonious; it has only three parameters and thus avoids over-fitting, (3) 3PL can spot anomalies, and we report the most surprising ones, in our real networks, (4) We observe that the degree of reciprocity between users is correlated with their local topological features; reciprocity is higher among mutual users with larger local network overlap and greater degree similarity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Data sets; Large cities; Local networks; Mobile-phone users; Overfitting; Phone calls; Real networks; Three parameters; Topological features; Weighted networks; Data mining; Topology; Outsourcing","Akoglu, L.; Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer ScienceUnited States; email: lakoglu@cs.cmu.edu",,,03029743,9783642302190,,,"English","Lect.

Phishers disguise attacks as trustworthy organizations by cloning websites. According to international monitoring, phishing causes real injury mainly to banks and government institutions.

Next, the results of an experiment performed on discrete events from associations describing relationships patterns among items in a database are presented. In the third experiment, a decision tree is used to reveal relationships among several analogue variables as: the relationship between the downstream water level and generated power, for example. In the fourth experiment, a decision tree is designed to detect if the hydro generator operation is violating any constraint imposed by its capability curve, also indicating which limit is extrapolated.

Sequences from a cDNA library that was constructed with poly A+RNA from the ovaries of R. americana larvae at different ages were analyzed. Molecular characterization confirmed interesting findings, such as the presence of Rananos. The nanos gene encodes a conserved RNA-binding protein that is required during early development for the maintenance and division of the primordial germ cells of Diptera. Nanos plays an important role in specifying the posterior regions of insect embryos and is important for abdomen formation. In the present work, we showed the spatial and temporal expression profiles of this important gene, which is involved in oogenesis and early development. Data mining techniques were used to obtain the complete sequence of Rananos. Bioinformatic tools were used to determine the following: (1) the secondary structure of the 3?-untranslated region of the Rananos mRNA, (2) the encoded protein of the isolated Rananos gene, (3) the conserved zinc-finger domains of the RaNanos protein, and (4) phylogenetic analyses.

The first measurements were on gene expression noise in bacteria and yeast. The relative biological and physicochemical simplicity of these single cells encouraged a number of groups to try similar approaches in multicellular organisms. Such work has been primarily on whole Drosophila embryos, where the genes forming the body plan are very well understood. The numerous sources of noise in complex embryonic tissues are a major challenge for characterizing gene expression noise. Here, we present our approach for first separating experimental from biological noise, followed by distinguishing sources of biological noise. We decompose raw signal into trend and residual noise using Singular Spectrum Analysis. We demonstrate our statistical techniques on the Drosophila Hunchback protein pattern.

However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal is often to correctly classify production batches into classes, such as good or failed, based on the process variables. We propose a method for selecting the best process variables for classification of process batches using multiple criteria including classification performance measures (i.e.; sensitivity and specificity) and the measurement cost. The method applies Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression on the training set to derive an importance index for each variable. Then an iterative classification/elimination procedure using k-Nearest Neighbor is carried out. Finally, Pareto analysis is used to select the best set of variables and avoid excessive retention of variables. The method proposed here consistently selects process variables important for classification, regardless of the batches included in the training data. Further, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method using six industrial datasets. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One such application is Foursquare, which doubled its user population in less than six months. Among other features, Foursquare allows users to leave tips (i.e., reviews or recommendations) at specific venues as well as to give feedback on previously posted tips by adding them to their to-do lists or marking them as done. In this paper, we analyze how Foursquare users exploit these three features - tips, dones and to-dos - uncovering different behavior profiles. Our study reveals the existence of very active and influential users, some of which are famous businesses and brands, that seem engaged in posting tips at a large variety of venues while also receiving a great amount of user feedback on them. We also provide evidence of spamming, showing the existence of users that post tips whose contents are unrelated to the nature or domain of the venue where the tips were left.

Visualization can support tasks that involve large collections of data, such as the studies collected, evaluated and summarized in an SLR. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study (SM) conducted to collect and evaluate evidence on the use of a specific visualization technique, visual data mining (VDM), to support the SLR process. We reviewed 20 papers and our results indicate a scarcity of research on the use of VDM to help with conducting SLRs in the software engineering domain. However, most of the studies (16 of the 20 studies included in our mapping) have been conducted in the field of medicine and they revealed that the activities of data extraction and data synthesis, related to conducting the review phase of an SLR process, have more VDM support than other activities. In contrast, according to our SM, previous studies using VDM techniques with SLRs have not employed such techniques during the SLR's planning and reporting phases.© 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Visual data mining","Data extraction; Data synthesis; Methods of synthesis; Research questions; Review process; Software engineering domain; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Visual data mining; Visualization technique; Data mining; Software engineering; Visualization; Mapping","Felizardo, K.

Vocalization is a valuable tool to identify situations of stress in pigs, and it can be used in welfare records for traceability. The objective of this work was to identify stress in piglets using vocalization, calling this stress on three levels: no stress, moderate stress, and acute stress. An experiment was conducted on a commercial farm in the municipality of Holambra, São Paulo State, where vocalizations of twenty piglets were recorded during the castration procedure, and separated into two groups: without anesthesia and local anesthesia with lidocaine base. For the recording of acoustic signals, a unidirectional microphone was connected to a digital recorder, in which signals were digitized at a frequency of 44,100 Hz. For evaluation of sound signals, Praat® software was used, and different data mining algorithms were applied using Weka® software. The selection of attributes improved model accuracy, and the best attribute selection was used by applying Wrapper method, while the best classification algorithms were the k-NN and Naive Bayes.

This work presents a methodology by using a Data Mining approach in order to predict landslide occurrences induced by rainfall in Rio de Janeiro city. Landslide and rain data records from 1998 to 2001 were obtained from field technical reports and 30 automatic rain gauges, respectively. It was also collected data regarding soil parameters, including urban areas, forest, vulnerability, among others, and totalizing 46 soil variables. All the information was inserted into a Geographic Information Systems. Clustering (Dendrogram and k-means) and Statistical (Principal Component Analysis and Correlation) techniques were used to regionalize the rain data and select the rain gauges to be input on Artificial Neural Networks, which were used to replace the missing rain values. The landslide volume variable also presented missing values and it was completed by the k-Nearest Neighbor method. After data preparation, some models were built to predict landslide and rainfall using Data Mining techniques. The obtained model's performance is also analyzed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial neural network; Classification rules; Data mining; Geographic information systems; Landslide","Artificial Neural Network; Classification rules; Data based model; Data mining techniques; Data preparation; Data records; Dendrograms; Geographic information; Geotechnical; K-means; K-nearest neighbor method; Landslide prediction; Missing values; Rain gauges; Soil parameters; Soil variables; Urban areas; Data mining; Forecasting; Gages; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Landslides; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Rain gages; Rain; artificial neural network; data mining; database; GIS; landslide; prediction; rainfall; raingauge; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Rio de Janeiro [Rio de Janeiro (STT)]","de Souza, F.

The government needs effective tools to fight against crime, and therefore, some tools are necessary to assist in the prevention of further crimes, in the allocation of its resources and visualisation of geographic areas with high crime concentrations. This paper proposes a model of data mining, predicting criminal levels in geographic areas. The model was proposed to work using specifically criminal and socio-economic data. This work shows the approach proposed to face the problems of this social phenomenon, as a unified process. A case study was used to validate the proposed procedure. The data used were crime and socioeconomic data of the metropolitan region of Fortaleza - Brazil (RMF). The case study proved that the process is useful and effective in building a predictor of criminal levels.

The main goal of this study is to analyze the data of candidates to selection processes of Federal Institute from Minas Gerais - IFMG in search of patterns that are not explicit, with the support of a free tool for data mining. This study comes to the research question of what are the relevant information about the profile of candidates who qualify in the selection process of IFMG. Through data mining and analysis of results is possible to define the profile of applicants and the features that influence the selection process. This article presents a study on the database in the candidates selection process of IFMG. One of the requirements of the research includes the study of data mining tools available on the Internet and a test applies in a real situation. Then the article presents an experience of using a free tool for Data Mining. The software chosen for the tests, called Weka, was developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It makes searching for patterns in database of system used to the management of selection processes of the Federal Institute from Minas Gerais. The methodology includes access to the database IFMG, with 9952 records of candidates for the selection process. Five categories were defined as relevant for verification and analysis. Categories include sex, marital status, age, waiver of registration fee and have disabilities or not. We used the attributes that have 100 or more occurrences in the database. The results show that the pattern that occurred more frequently among those classified in absolute numbers was that of male candidates, who had no exemption from the registration fee, less than 30 years old and single, with 166 occurrences. Among all candidates, 718 have these characteristics, so 9.66% of the candidates that fit this pattern was classified. The pattern with the highest percentage of occurrence were male candidates, who had no exemption from the registration fee, less than 30 years old and married. Of the 301 candidates with all these features that participate in the processes of selection, 31 were classified. It represents 10.33% of 301 candidates evaluated. There were 9952 candidates of which 711 were classified, the representing 7.14%. Among the 291 candidates with exemption from the registration fee, only 3 were qualified which represents 1.03%. This result indicates that lower-income applicants had lower performance. The associative algorithm provides a list of up to 100 rules, which were presented in this article the top 15 with a combination of categories, sex, marital status, age, registration fee and deficiencies. The survey allows the discovery of patterns in database performance with different combinations of the categories.","Data mining; Database; Information retrieval; Information system; Selection process; Weka","Cybernetics; Database systems; Decision making; Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Information systems; Search engines; Software testing; Absolute number; Candidate selection; Data-mining tools; Database performance; Information age; Research questions; Verification and analysis; Weka; Data mining",,"Savoie M.J.Callaos N.C.Siddique M.Sanchez B.Zinn C.D.Tremante A.","International Institute of Informatics and Systemics, IIIS",,9781936338573,,,"English","Int.

For pre-processing imaging, atmospheric and signal/noise effect corrections were carried out using Flaash and MNF (Minimum Noise Fraction Transform) algorithms, respectively. Spectral behavior profiles (38) of different coffee varieties were generated from 150 Hyperion bands. The spectral behavior profiles were analyzed by Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm considering 2; 3; 4 and 5 clusters. T-test with 5% of significance was used to verify the similarity among the wavelength cluster means. The results demonstrated that it is possible to separate five different clusters, which were comprised by different coffee crop conditions making possible to improve future intervention actions.","Crop monitoring; Management; Orbital remote sensing; Spectral behavior",,"Lamparelli, R.A.C.; CEPAGRI, UNICAMP, Cidade Universitária, Av.

Nevertheless, the results obtained from such optimization problems could not necessarily represent the most convincing solution. The shape, tendencies, and physical meaning of the obtained states profiles can even be questioned regardless the efficiency of the solving algorithms used. The proposal of a novel optimization structure (weighted least squares based problem) solved by a dual stochastic algorithm in order to capture more detailed output profiles in a parameter estimation problem, is the main contribution of this paper. First trials assayed with data obtained from a lab scale dairy wastewater treatment process, showed the benefits of using the developed techniques when comparing against traditional parameter estimation approaches. The dual optimization structure and the stochastic solver algorithm proposed in this work reveal to be a promising strategy for data mining enhancement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Dual optimization; Parameter estimation; Particle swarm optimization",,"Ferrari, A.; GISQyP, Chemical and Process Systems Engineering Group - IIQ, Universidad de la República, Julio Herrera yReissig 565, CP 11300, Montevideo, Uruguay; email: aferrari@fing.edu.uy",,"Elsevier B.V.",15707946,,,,"English","Comput.

The experiments showed good results for the training sets, but not so satisfactory for the test sets. Thus, it follows that the proposed algorithm should be improved in order to obtain a better generalization for the results (rules).","Attributes selection; Extraction of classification rules; Genetic algorithm","Exhibitions; Extraction; Genetic algorithms; Attributes selection; Classification rules; Knowledge discovery in database; Rules extraction; Selection of attributes; Test sets; Training sets; Data mining",,,"Institute of Industrial Engineers",,,,,"English","IIE Annu.

Relief information provided by the TOPODATA geomorphometric database was also used as input data. The studied area is Nova Friburgo County, with an extension of 933 km2, located in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro State. The Kappa index obtained by the classification based on statistical and texture attributes was 0.81, while the result for the classification derived only from statistical attributes achieved 0.84.

Less pollutant technologies and more efficient fuels have been developed in the last years driven by constrains imposed by government regulations. However, the estimation of such improvements in the real scenario is very hard to be evaluated due to many reasons mainly because the difficulty of reliable emission models. The main oil companies and automakers usually perform emissions tests to support the development of new fuels and to evaluate new production technologies. So, a large amount of data is generated that can be useful to develop data based models through data mining techniques. In this work, a data base that has been collected over more than 10 years is used to build neural network models for pollutant emissions, given the gasoline properties and vehicle characteristics. The resulting models have achieved performances comparable to the uncertainties inherent into the emissions tests. The models are used to estimate the emissions impacts of the new gasoline composition that should be produced in Brazil in a near future. The results show that the new fuel composition allows the reduction of the main pollutants concentrations without a significant drop in vehicle fuel economy.

This fact enabled the emergence and growth of research on Data Min-ing (DM), which aims primarily at identifying new and useful patterns in databases. Recently, software quality has received attention among areas of application. The quality of software has become an important issue for the maintenance and customer attraction for businesses and can be considered a competitive weapon. On the other hand, the quality of decision making in project management software is closely related to information available about the process of organizational development. This information can be stored in data warehouses to be analyzed and interpreted using techniques of DM. This paper describes an application of DM bases of quality metrics for software products, which are aimed at identifying the variables of the development process that would mostly affect the error rate during the phases of testing, approval, and production. The study of the target company has a high level of stand-ardization of processes. The results obtained in the models indicated a strong or moderate correlation of some variables of the process with product quality, which may be the target of management attention in order to: (i) improve the overall quality of the development process, (ii) Advances in Knowledge-Based and Inreduce the error rate in the systems developed and (iii) promote greater customer satisfaction. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

There are many different approaches used but the companies, however, the decision about what is the most effective in terms of personnel performance management is a hard task. In this paper, a study based in data mining techniques is presented to help managers in this process. The common practice, used by the companies, is classify the candidates according the personal characteristics that are necessary to achieve a good performance using normally internal/personal characteristics more than external/environmental influences as determinant for the behaviors. The existing tools can be categorized according to their objectives, ranging from the selection process to the measurement of the performance achieved by the employees. Usually, these tools are not interconnected and the information generated by them does not allow a consistent analysis of the different stages of the employee and his professional evolution. It was mapped the different standards of leadership profile and performance results of the employees that work a specific company. Also, a classifier based in the Combinatorial Neural Model was built to find the relations between the personal characteristics and performance results. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

On considering this context, this paper presents an approach for detecting and extracting labels in Web forms. For detecting a Web form, we propose an algorithm that analyzes HTML tags and identifies if a Web page contains a form or not. We also developed an algorithm for label extraction based on the distance between a form field and page labels in order to find out the relationship between them.

Differentiation between permeable and impermeable land, for instance, provides data for surface run-off estimates and flood prevention, whereas identification of vegetated areas enables studies of urban micro-climates. In place of maps, high-resolution images, such as those from the satellites IKONOS II, Quickbird, Orbview and WorldView II, can be used after processing. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a well-established method for classifying high-resolution images of urban areas. Despite the large number of previous studies of OBIA in the context of intra-urban analysis, there are many issues in this area that are still open to discussion and resolution. Intra-urban analysis using OBIA can be lengthy and complex because of the processing difficulties related to image segmentation, the large number of object attributes to be resolved and the many different methods needed to classify various image objects. To overcome these issues, we performed an experiment consisting of land-cover mapping based on an OBIA approach using an IKONOS II image of a southern sector of São José dos Campos city (covering an area of 12 km2 with 50 neighbourhoods), which is located in São Paulo State in south-eastern Brazil. This area contains various occupation and land-use patterns, and it therefore contains a wide range of intra-urban targets. To generate the land-cover map, we proposed an OBIA-based processing framework that combines multi-resolution segmentation, data mining and hierarchical network techniques. The intra-urban land-cover map was then evaluated through an object-based error matrix, and classification accuracy indices were obtained. The final classification, with 11 classes, achieved a global accuracy of 71.91%. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Data mining; Flood control; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Land use; Mapping; Urban planning; Classification accuracy; Hierarchical network; High resolution image; Land cover classification; Land cover mapping; Object based image analysis; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Urban environments; Image classification; accuracy assessment; IKONOS; image analysis; image resolution; land classification; land cover; mapping method; matrix; QuickBird; urban area; urban planning; Brazil; Sao Jose dos Campos; Sao Paulo [Brazil]","de Pinho, C.

Most methods use some technique to transform raw data into another representation. Symbolic representations approaches have shown effectiveness in speedup processing and noise removal. The current most commonly used algorithm is the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX). However, SAX doesn’t preserve the slope information of the time series segments because it uses only the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation for dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we present a symbolic representation method to dimensionality reduction and discretization that preserves the behavior of slope characteristics of the time series segments. The proposed method was compared with the SAX algorithm using artificial and real datasets with 1-nearest-neighbor classification. Experimental results demonstrate the method effectiveness to reduce the error rates of time series classification and to keep the slope information in the symbolic representation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Classification; Dimensionality Reduction; Knowledge Discovery; Symbolic Representation; Time Series","Aggregates; Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Time series; Dimensionality reduction; Discretizations; Piecewise aggregate approximation; Real data sets; Slope information; Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX); Symbolic representation; Time series classifications; Classification (of information)",,"Barros L.N.Finger M.Pozo A.T.R.Castilho M.Gimenenez-Lugo G.A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783642344589,,,"English","Lect.

Words were considered highly consistent if the authors used them with the same neighborhood. When ranked according to the consistency of use, the words obeyed a log-normal distribution, in contrast to Zipf's law that applies to the frequency of use. Consistency correlated positively with the familiarity and frequency of use, and negatively with ambiguity and age of acquisition. An inspection of some highly consistent words confirmed that they are used in very limited semantic contexts. A comparison of consistency indices for eight authors indicated that these indices may be employed for author recognition. Indeed, as expected, authors of novels could be distinguished from those who wrote scientific texts. Our analysis demonstrated the suitability of the consistency indices, which can now be applied in other tasks, such as emotion recognition. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.","communication; data mining (experiment); networks; pattern formation (experiment); random graphs; supply and information networks",,"Amancio, D.R.; Institute of Physics of São Carlos, University of São Paulo, PO Box 369, 13560-970, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil; email: diegoraphael@gmail.com",,,17425468,,,,"English","J.

However, we observe that most of these works propose metamodels that mix concepts of DW modeling (i.e. dimensions and their descriptive attributes) with concepts of OLAP modeling (i.e. hierarchies and their levels). We understand that this mix is a possible limitation, because a DW (conventional or spatial) is essentially a large data repository, which can be analyzed/queried by any data analysis technology (e.g. GIS, Data Mining and OLAP). With aim of overcoming such limitation, in this paper we propose a SDW metamodel, named Spatial Data Warehouse Metamodel (SDWM), which describes constructors and restrictions needed to model SDW schemas. We have implemented a CASE tool according to our metamodel and, by exploiting this tool, we have designed two demonstrative SDW schemas.","Data Models; Data Warehouse; Spatial Databases","Data structures; Information systems; Systems engineering; Large data; Meta model; Spatial data warehouse; Spatial database; Data warehouses",,,"CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892619697

Structural correlation pattern mining combines aspects of frequent itemset and quasi-clique mining problems. We propose statistical significance measures that compare the structural correlation of attribute sets against their expected values using null models. Moreover, we evaluate the interestingness of structural correlation patterns in terms of size and density.

It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach.

The main objectives were to detect, characterize and classify the dispersed and continuous phases of a liquid mixture during its fermentation process. The liquid mixture is a liquid-solid system composed by sugarcane juice and yeast species saccharomyces cerevisiae. This sample study was monitored by ultrasound exposure in pulse-echo mode during the fermentation bioprocess and then ultrasound backscattering echoes were recorded in RoI. The computational procedures implemented for ultrasonic characterization were based in the extraction of spectral attributes (central frequency, spectral bandwidth, etc.), ultrasonic parameters (such as attenuation and the integrated backscattering coefficient), stationarity analysis by non-parametric statistical Run Test, backscattering waveform analysis by Curve Fitting on bandwidth spectrum and data classification by k-means algorithm. The main results showed a parametric discrimination of regions inside liquid system with and without solid particles during the fermentation evolution.

The geometric constraints were such to limit the search to a terminal carbonyl ligand interacting with a ring centroid of an arene ring, that is, for delocalized M-CO(lone pair)...π(arene) interactions operating in isolation of complementary supramolecular synthons. M-CO(lone pair)...π(arene) interactions were found to be important in stabilizing supramolecular architectures and to lead to, usually, zero-dimensional aggregation patterns. One-dimensional examples are also known and even a sole three-dimensional example is described.

Bandeirantes, 3900, Ribeirão Preto, SP  14040-901, Brazil","For a long time, experimental studies have been performed in a large number of fields of AI, specially in machine learning. A careful evaluation of a specific machine learning algorithm is important, but often difficult to conduct in practice. On the other hand, simulation studies can provide insights on behavior and performance aspects of machine learning approaches much more readily than using real-world datasets, where the target concept is normally unknown. Under decision tree induction algorithms an interesting source of instability that sometimes is neglected by researchers is the number of classes in the training set. This paper uses simulation to extended a previous work performed by Leo Breiman about properties of splitting criteria. Our simulation results have showed the number of best-splits grows according to the number of classes: exponentially, for both entropy and twoing criteria and linearly, for gini criterion. Since more splits imply more alternative choices, decreasing the number of classes in high dimensional datasets (ranging from hundreds to thousands of attributes, typically found in biomedical domains) can help lowering instability of decision trees. Another important contribution of this work concerns the fact that for <5 classes balanced datasets are prone to provide more best-splits (thus increasing instability) than imbalanced ones, including binary problems often addressable in machine learning; on the other hand, for five or more classes balanced datasets can provide few best-splits. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Decision tree; Number of classes; Number of splits","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Stability; Decision tree induction; Decision-tree algorithm; High dimensional datasets; Machine learning approaches; Number of class; Number of splits; Source of instability; Splitting criterion; Data mining","Baranauskas, J.A.; Department of Computer Science and Mathematics (FFCLRP), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Av.

Video searching and browsing can be used in many situations, like in case-based diagnosis when videos of previously diagnosed cases are compared, in case referrals, in reviewing the patient records, as well as for supporting medical research (e.g. in human reproduction). However, in terms of visual content, diagnostic hysteroscopy videos contain lots of information, but only a reduced number of frames are actually useful for diagnosis/prognosis purposes. In order to facilitate the browsing task, we propose in this paper a technique for estimating the clinical relevance of video segments in diagnostic hysteroscopies. Basically, the proposed technique associates clinical relevance with the attention attracted by a diagnostic hysteroscopy video segment during the video acquisition (i.e. during the diagnostic hysteroscopy conducted by a specialist). We show that the resulting video summary allows specialists to browse the video contents nonlinearly, while avoiding spending time on spurious visual information. In this work, we review state-of-art methods for summarizing general videos and how they apply to diagnostic hysteroscopy videos (considering their specific characteristics), and conclude that our proposed method contributes to the field with a summarization and representation method specific for video hysteroscopies. The experimental results indicate that our method tends to produce compact video summaries without discarding clinically relevant information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Hysteroscopy; Medical video; Video browsing; Video indexing; Video summarization","Hysteroscopy; Medical video; Video browsing; Video indexing; Video summarization; Image segmentation; Video recording; Endoscopy; article; attention; diagnostic imaging; human; hysteroscopy; medical record; medical research; medical specialist; physician; priority journal; reproduction; videorecording; visual information; Attention; Data Mining; Database Management Systems; Female; Humans; Hysteroscopy; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiology Information Systems; User-Computer Interface; Video Recording","Scharcanski, J.; Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Avenida Bento Gonçalves, 9500, 91501-970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; email: jacobs@inf.ufrgs.br",,,13618415,,MIAEC,"21920798","English","Med.
