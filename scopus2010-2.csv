Famous epidemiological studies reported its presence among all cultures and geographic regions. In that sense, Unified Etiological hypothesis face the challenge to both present experimental data, and to show that the findings may cope with the syndrome's universal profile. Objectives: systematically review the most prominent Unified Etiological hypothesis, as much as the semantic distribution of genetic findings (under up to date data mining techniques), and propose a new model, based on the dynamic effects of epigenics over genetic activation in both neurodevelopment and early adulthood. Results: in general, Unified Etiological Hypothesis contradict the main genetic findings (which suggest that schizophrenias' genes are mostly associated with neurotransmitter profiles, like D-1 and the Glutamate-NMDA cascade); also in general, genetic findings are spread all over the genome (as we reveal with a topological map of the 3519 studies on the matter). The key for this conundrum may be represented by the association between the perspective that each polymorphism associated with schizophrenia represents a statistical risk factor (e.g. increasing the risk of developmental instability) while epigenetic molecular cascades and environmental factors considerably influence this picture, affecting genetic activation within critical periods.","Brain; Etiology; Schizophrenia",,"Dias, A.

Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Background: Retrieving pertinent information from biological scientific literature requires cutting-edge text mining methods which may be able to recognize the meaning of the very ambiguous names of biological entities. Aliases of a gene share a common vocabulary in their respective collections of PubMed abstracts. This may be true even when these aliases are not associated with the same subset of documents. This gene-specific vocabulary defines a unique fingerprint that can be used to disclose ambiguous aliases. The present work describes an original method for automatically assessing the ambiguity levels of gene aliases in large gene terminologies based exclusively in the content of their associated literature. The method can deal with the two major problems restricting the usage of current text mining tools: 1) different names associated with the same gene; and 2) one name associated with multiple genes, or even with non-gene entities. Important, this method does not require training examples.Results: Aliases were considered "" ambiguous"" when their Jaccard distance to the respective official gene symbol was equal or greater than the smallest distance between the official gene symbol and one of the three internal controls (randomly picked unrelated official gene symbols). Otherwise, they were assigned the status of "" synonyms"" . We evaluated the coherence of the results by comparing the frequencies of the official gene symbols in the text corpora retrieved with their respective "" synonyms"" or "" ambiguous"" aliases. Official gene symbols were mentioned in the abstract collections of 42 % (70/165) of their respective synonyms. No official gene symbol occurred in the abstract collections of any of their respective ambiguous aliases. In overall, querying PubMed with official gene symbols and "" synonym"" aliases allowed a 3.6-fold increase in the number of unique documents retrieved.Conclusions: These results confirm that this method is able to distinguish between synonyms and ambiguous gene aliases based exclusively on their vocabulary fingerprint. The approach we describe could be used to enhance the retrieval of relevant literature related to a gene. © 2010 Coimbra et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"acyl coenzyme A desaturase 1; alpha adducin; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; algorithm; article; automation; data mining; DNA fingerprinting; gene cluster; gene expression; human; information retrieval; nomenclature; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; algorithm; data mining; gene; linguistics; Medline; methodology; nomenclature; semantics; Algorithms; Data Mining; Genes; PubMed; Semantics; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled","Coimbra, R.S.; Center for Excellence in Bioinformatics, Research Center René Rachou, FIOCRUZ-MG., Rua Araguari 741, Barro Preto.

Typically, molecular docking algorithms consider receptors as rigid bodies. Receptors are, however, intrinsically flexible in the cellular environment. The use of a time series of receptor conformations is an approach to explore its flexibility in molecular docking computer simulations, but it is extensively time-consuming. Hence, selection of the most promising conformations can accelerate docking experiments and, consequently, the RDD efforts.Results: We previously docked four ligands (NADH, TCL, PIF and ETH) to 3,100 conformations of the InhA receptor from M. tuberculosis. Based on the receptor residues-ligand distances we preprocessed all docking results to generate appropriate input to mine data. Data preprocessing was done by calculating the shortest interatomic distances between the ligand and the receptor's residues for each docking result. They were the predictive attributes. The target attribute was the estimated free-energy of binding (FEB) value calculated by the AutodDock3.0.5 software. The mining inputs were submitted to the M5P model tree algorithm. It resulted in short and understandable trees. On the basis of the correlation values, for NADH, TCL and PIF we obtained more than 95% correlation while for ETH, only about 60%. Post processing the generated model trees for each of its linear models (LMs), we calculated the average FEB for their associated instances. From these values we considered a LM as representative if its average FEB was smaller than or equal the average FEB of the test set. The instances in the selected LMs were considered the most promising snapshots. It totalized 1,521, 1,780, 2,085 and 902 snapshots, for NADH, TCL, PIF and ETH respectively.Conclusions: By post processing the generated model trees we were able to propose a criterion of selection of linear models which, in turn, is capable of selecting a set of promising receptor conformations. As future work we intend to go further and use these results to elaborate a strategy to preprocess the receptors 3-D spatial conformation in order to predict FEB values. Besides, we intend to select other compounds, among the million catalogued, that may be promising as new drug candidates for our particular protein receptor target. © 2010 Machado et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; bacterial protein; InhA protein, Mycobacterium; ligand; oxidoreductase; algorithm; article; computer program; crystal structure; data mining; information processing; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; prediction; protein conformation; statistical model; time series analysis; algorithm; chemical structure; drug design; metabolism; protein conformation; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Algorithms; Bacterial Proteins; Drug Design; Ligands; Linear Models; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Oxidoreductases; Protein Conformation","Norberto de Souza, O.; LABIO - Laboratório de Bioinformática, Modelagem e Simulação de Biossistemas.

Once this structure is built, it is necessary to find labels for each of the obtained clusters. In many cases the labels have to be built using only the terms in the documents of the collection. This paper presents the SeCLAR (Selecting Candidate Labels using Association Rules) method, which explores the use of association rules for the selection of good candidates for labels of hierarchical document clusters. The candidates are processed by a classical method to generate the labels. The idea of the proposed method is to process each parent-child relationship of the nodes as an antecedent-consequent relationship of association rules. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the precision and recall of labels obtained by classical methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","association rules; label hierarchical clustering; text mining","Classical methods; Hierarchical document; Precision and recall; Search and retrieval; Structural representation; Text mining; Classical methods; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical document; Precision and recall; Search and retrieval; Structural representation; Text mining; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation; Soft computing; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Soft computing; Association rules; Association rules","Dos Santos, F.

This parameter acts on generalize rales, especially the ones with low minimum support, preserving their semantic and eliminating redundancy, thus reducing considerably the amount of generated rales.

This knowledge includes the business process itself as well as business rules, and organizational structure aspects, such as actors and roles. However, existent algorithms for extracting business processes neither scale very well when using larger datasets, nor support incremental mining of logs. Process mining can benefit from an incremental mining strategy especially when the information system source code is logically complex, requiring a large dataset of logs in order for the mining algorithm to discover and present its complete business process behavior. Incremental process mining can also pay off when it is necessary to extract the complete business process model gradually by extracting partial models in a first step and integrating them into a complete model in a final step. This paper presents an incremental algorithm for mining business processes. The new algorithm enables the update as well as the enlargement, and improvement of a partial process model as new log records are added to the log file. In this way, processing time can be significantly reduced since only new event traces are processed rather than the complete log data.","Incremental mining; Process mining; Workflow","Application execution; Business Process; Business process model; Business rules; Data sets; Incremental algorithm; Incremental mining; Incremental process; Log data; Log file; Mining algorithms; Organizational structures; Process mining; Process model; Processing Time; Source codes; Workflow; Algorithms; Data processing; Information systems; Management; Management science; Data mining","Kalsing, A.; Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Bento Gonçalves, 91501-970 Porto Alegre, Brazil; email: ackalsing@inf.ufrgs.br",,,,9789898425041,,,"English","ICEIS - Proc.

The main contribution of this algorithm is to present a way to work with geographical and conventional data in data mining tasks. In our approach, each individual in the genetic programming represents a classification rule using a boolean predicate. The adequacy of the individual to the problem is assessed using a fitness function, which determines its chances for selection. In each individual, the predicate combines conventional attributes (boolean, numeric) and geographic characteristics, evaluated using geometric and topological functions. Our prototype implementation of the tool was compared favorably to other classical classification ones. We show that the proposed niched genetic programming algorithm works efficiently with databases that contain geographic objects, opening up new possibilities for the use of genetic programming in geographic data mining problems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Classification rules; data mining; knowledge discovery in geographic databases","Boolean predicates; Classification rules; Data mining tasks; Fitness functions; Geographic characteristics; Geographic data; Geographic database; Geographic objects; Knowledge Discovery; Programming algorithms; Prototype implementations; Boolean predicates; Classification rules; Data mining tasks; Genetic programming algorithms; Geographic characteristics; Geographic database; Geographic objects; Prototype implementations; Algorithms; Biology; Boolean functions; Classification (of information); Database systems; Function evaluation; Genetic programming; Topology; Classification (of information); Database systems; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Data mining; Data mining","De Arruda Pereira, M.; Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais, Av.

The main contribution of this work is to present how LVF data mining technique improves Sarsa(.λ) algorithm combined with tile-coding technique by selecting the most relevant features and actions from reinforcement learning environments. The objective of this selection is to reduce the complexity of the problem and the amount of memory used by the agent thus leading to faster convergence. The motivation of this work was inspired by the rationale behind Occam's razor, which describes that a complex model tends to be less accurate than another with a lower complexity. The difficulty in using data mining techniques in reinforcement learning environments is due to the lack of data in a database, so this paper proposes a storage schema for states visited and actions performed by the agent. In this study, the selection of features and actions are applied to a specific problem of RoboCup soccer, the dribble. This problem is composed of 20 continuous variables and 113 actions available to the agent which results in a memory consumption of approximately 4.5mb when the traditional Sarsa(λ) algorithm is used combined with the tile-coding technique. The experiments' results show that the amount of variables in the environment were reduced by 35% and the amount of actions by 65%, which resulted in a reduction in memory consumption of 43% and an increase in performance of up to 23%, according to the relative frequency distribution of agent's success. The approach proposed here is both easy to use and efficient. ©2010 IEEE.","Data mining; Feature and action selection; Intelligent agents; Reinforcement learning; RoboCup","Action selection; Coding techniques; Complex model; Continuous variables; Data mining techniques; Faster convergence; Large amounts of data; Lower complexity; Memory consumption; Occam's razor; Relative frequencies; RoboCup; RoboCup soccer; Specific problems; Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Intelligent agents; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Data mining","Vieira, D.

FCF is based on the fuzzy partitioning of features into clusters. The number of clusters is automatically estimated from data. After the clustering process, FCF selects a subset of features from the obtained clusters. To do so, we study four different strategies that are based on the information provided by the fuzzy partition matrix. We also show that these strategies can be combined for better performance. Empirical results illustrate the performance of FCF, which in general has obtained competitive results in classification tasks when compared to a related filter that is based on the hard partitioning of features. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,"Better performance; Classification tasks; Clustering process; Data mining algorithm; Fuzzy partition; Fuzzy partitioning; Number of clusters; Redundant features; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Data processing; Fuzzy clustering; Knowledge based systems; Information management","Computer Science Department, University of São Paulo (USP) at São CarlosBrazil","Hullermeier E.Kruse R.Hoffmann F.",,18650929,9783642140549,,,"English","Commun.

Moreover, databases are becoming increasingly larger, thus requiring a higher computing power to mine them in reasonable time. At the same time, the advances in high performance computing platforms are transforming them into hierarchical parallel environments equipped with multi-core processors and many-core accelerators, such as GPUs. Thus, fully exploiting these systems to perform FIM tasks poses as a challenging and critical problem that we address in this paper. We present efficient multi-core and GPU accelerated parallelizations of the Tree Projection, one of the most competitive FIM algorithms.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining of EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the representation of time-frequency patterns of the signal's information content by WC qualiatative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions in timefrequency spectrum during the specified task of BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns are classified using a Nä?ve Bayes Classifier (NBC). This innovative characteristic of the process justifies the feasibility of the proposed approach to other data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches in this field and on non stationary time series analysis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Brain computer Interface; Classification; Pattern analysis; Signal processing","brain computer interface; classifier; conference paper; continuous wavelet transformation; controlled study; data mining; electroencephalography; methodology; Naive Bayes Classifier; priority journal; quantitative analysis; signal processing; statistical analysis; time series analysis; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; brain; brain mapping; computer interface; electroencephalography; human; physiology; signal processing; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Brain; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; User-Computer Interface","Cesar Nievola, J.; PUCPR, PPGIa (Programa de Pós-Graduaç Ão em Informática)Brazil; email: nievola@ppgia.pucpr.br","Hussain A.Cutsuridis V.Smith L.S.Aleksander I.Barros A.K.Chrisley R.",,00652598,9780387790992,AEMBA,"20020346","English","Adv.

Thus, plant operators have to identify an event based upon the evaluation of several distinct process variables, which might difficult operators' actions and decisions. Transient identification systems have been proposed in order to support the analysis with the aim of achieving successful or effective courses of action, as well as to reduce the time interval for a decision and corrective actions. This article presents a system for accident and transient identification in a pressurized water nuclear reactor whose optimization step of the classification algorithm is based upon the paradigm of the Quantum Computing. In this case, the optimization metaheuristic Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) was implemented and works like a data mining tool. The system is able to identify anomalous events, without the use of an initiating event (reactor scram, for instance) as the start point of a time dependence related to postulated transients. The results of the classification of transients are compared with other results in the literature.","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis systems; Nuclear power plant; Quantum computer transient identification","Anomalous events; Classification algorithm; Corrective actions; Courses of actions; Data-mining tools; Diagnosis systems; Event-based; Initiating events; Optimization metaheuristic; Plant operators; Pressurized water; Process Variables; Quantum Computing; Quantum evolutionary algorithms; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Start point; Time dependence; Time interval; Transient identification; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Data mining; Mathematical operators; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Optimization; Quantum computers; Teaching; Transients; Evolutionary algorithms","Dos Santos Nicolau, A.; Federal University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil",,,17924863,,,,"English","Int.

Keywords corresponding to plant resistance mechanisms to pathogens identified in the literature were used as baits for data mining. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) related to each of these keywords were identified with tools available in the BCGP bioinformatics platform. A total of 11,300 ESTs were mined. These ESTs were clustered and formed 979 EST-contigs with similarities to chitinases, kinases, cytochrome P450 and nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins, as well as with proteins re- lated to disease resistance, pathogenesis, hypersensitivity response (HR) and plant defense responses to diseases. The 140 EST-contigs identified through the keyword NBS-LRR were classified according to function. This classifica- tion allowed association of the predicted products of EST-contigs with biological processes, including host defense and apoptosis, and with molecular functions such as nucleotide binding and signal transducer activity. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the significance of differences in contig expression between libraries representing the re- sponses to biotic stress challenges and other libraries from the BCGP. This analysis revealed seven contigs highly similar to catalase, chitinase, protein with a BURP domain and unknown proteins. The involvement of these coffee proteins in plant responses to disease is discussed. © 2010, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.","Bioinformatics; Coffea; Data mining; ESTs; Genomics; In silico","catalase; catechol oxidase; chalcone synthase; chitinase; complementary DNA; cytochrome P450; glucan glucosidase; glucosyltransferase; heat shock protein; karyopherin; phytoalexin; thaumatin; article; biotic stress; Brazil; coffee; computer analysis; computer model; contig mapping; data analysis software; data mining; disease resistance; DNA library; expressed sequence tag; gene function; gene identification; genetic association; genome analysis; hypersensitivity reaction; nucleotide binding site; pathogenesis; plant defense; plant disease; plant genome; plant pathogen interaction; prediction; protein domain; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; structural bioinformatics; structure analysis; Coffea","Caixeta, E.

There is a need to improve user awareness related to the process and the context in which collaborative artifacts are generated. In this context, conceptual modeling is relevant since conceptual specifications can be used to support understanding, problem-solving, and communication among stakeholders about a given subject domain. This paper presents a conceptual model focused on contextual information for DiSEN, a distributed software engineering environment. Main contributions found on the paper are: (i) the identification of a set of information that compose environment entities context ; and (ii) the definition of a model that facilitates domain semantics comprehension, reducing communication gaps.","Conceptual modeling; Context modeling; Global software development","Communication gaps; Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling; Context modeling; Contextual information; Cooperation and coordination; Distributed software development; Distributed software engineering; Domain semantics; Global software development; Lower cost; Quality software; Data mining; Engineering; Knowledge engineering; Semantics; Software design","Chaves, A.

The self-organizing map (SOM) has been widely applied to tasks including multivariate data visualization and clustering. SOM not only quantizes the input data but also enables visual display of data, a property that does not exist in most clustering algorithms. In the past decade many developments have reported towards to mining useful information from a trained map. Most of them use post-processing methods in a two- or three-step procedure to enable finding clusters as contiguous regions on the map. The basic assumption relies on the data density approximation by the neurons through the unsupervised learning. By analyzing neighboring neurons and their relations and activities it is possible to draw, in many cases, the geometry of clusters. This paper discusses issues related to SOM clustering and segmentation with morphological image processing methods, such as filtering and watershed transform. It also briefly reviews SOM clustering related literature, such as surface-based and clustering (hierarchical and partitioning) algorithms.

However, most of these techniques provide little specific support to the programming. The main cause of this is the fact that these techniques were not developed with the same logic used in simulation models. From this issue, this paper presents an industrial application of a new conceptual modeling technique, named IDEF-SIM (Integrated Definition Methods - Simulation) currently under development by the authors. This adapted IDEF uses logic elements present in techniques such as IDEF0 and IDEF3, but in a way that is similar to the process interpretation logic usually used in simulation projects. This way, it can be noticed an increase in the conceptual model's utility, which might facilitate the simulation model programming, verification and validation and the scenarios creation. Additionally, the paper presents the benefits of using IDEF-SIM to create the conceptual model of a Brazilian tech company manufacturing cell. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling; Definition method; Logic elements; Manufacturing cells; Process Modeling; Simulation model; Simulation projects; Verification and validation; Data mining; Flexible manufacturing systems; Industrial applications; Industry; Computer simulation","Barra Montevechi, J.

This agricultural commodity is important to the country economy, becoming fundamental to improve models that assist the crops monitoring process. Vegetation indexes originated from remote sensing images and agrometeorological indexes can be combined to represent sugar cane fields in a regional scale. However, finding different regions with similar patterns to classify or analyze their characteristics is a non-trivial task. Accordingly, this paper presents a method to find similar sugar cane fields represented by series of vegetation and agrometeorological indexes. The proposed method combines a weighted distance function with an algorithm to find similar objects. Results were coincident in the most cases with the classification done by experts, finding regions with similar characteristics of climate and productivity. Consequently, this approach can help in decision making processes by agricultural entrepreneurs. © 2010 IEEE.","Agrometeoro-logical index; Climate change; Data mining; Ethanol; Vegetation index","Agricultural commodities; Agrometeoro-logical index; Decision making process; Ethanol production; Monitoring process; Non-trivial tasks; Regional scale; Remote sensing images; Renewable sources; Similar pattern; Similarity search; Vegetation index; Weighted distance; Agriculture; Data mining; Decision making; Ethanol; Geology; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Renewable energy resources; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar cane; Time series; Vegetation; Climate change","Romani, L.

When such tools are based on conventional computation, they have shown limitations to approach complex biological problems. In the present study, a computational evolutionary environment (CEE) is proposed as tool to extract classification rules from biological datasets. The main goal of the proposed approach is to allow the discovery of concise, yet accurate, high-level rules (from a biological database) which can be used as a classification system. More than focusing only on the classification accuracy, the proposed CEE model aims at balancing prediction precision, interpretability and comprehensibility.

Now, that approach for binary decision problems has been refined and is presented in this paper as the pRAM n-tuple Classifier. It consists of a single layer neural network inspired by the n-tuple classifier but with advantages in several aspects: 1) it does not need special binary encoding for continuous variables, 2) it generalizes smoothly, and 3) its performance improves with the increase in the amount of training examples without saturating. Experimental comparison carried out on the Proben1 benchmark problems against MultiLayer Perceptrons shows that there is no statistically significant difference between them.

Those rules permit to highlight patterns implicit in the transactions of large databases, which indicate determining causes and effects of supply and trade of bulls. In the analysis, it was considered 19,736 records of traded bulls, 17 farms and 15 attributes related to expected differences on the progenies of sires, place and time of sale. A system with user-driven graphical interface that allows generation and interactive selection of association rules was used. Pareto analysis was applied for the three objective measures (support, trust and lift) that follow each one of the association rules to validate them. It was generated 2,667 association rules, 164 considered to be useful by the user and 107 valid for lift ≥ 1.0505. The farms participating in the Nelore Brasil program present expertise in bull offering according to maternal ability characteristics, weight gain, fertility, sexual precocity, longevity, yield and termination of carcass. The genetic profiles of the bulls are different for standard and Mocho Nellore varieties. Some Brazilian regions are market niche for sires without registered herd. The analysis of evolution of the market suggests that Mérito Genético Total (MGT), the official index of the Program Nelore Brasil has become an important index for commercialization of bulls. By using association rules, it was possible to discover market forces and to identify combinations of genetic, geographical and temporal attributes that determine commercialization of bulls in Nelore Brasil program. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.","Bull trade; Data mining; Genetic improvement; Information technology; Market forces",,"Lôbo, R.B.; FMRP, USPBrazil; email: raysildo@gmail.com",,,15163598,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

Moreover, the results show significant semantic gain in the data patterns mined, which is a consequence of the data analysis performed according to the user view and needs. The proposed method also promotes an increase in productivity during the ontology building phase, since domain experts can analyze several contexts of the modeled domain in a single and straightforward way.","Context ontology; Data mining; Fuzzy ontology; Knowledge representation","Context ontology; Data analysis; Data patterns; Domain experts; Domain ontologies; Dynamic data analysis; Fuzzy ontology; Fuzzy relations; Medical insurance; Ontology building; Semantic associations; User view; Algorithms; Data mining; Data reduction; Dynamic analysis; Insurance; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Software engineering; Ontology","Cerri, M.

As a technique to solve the flood forecasting problem, it uses artificial intelligence, the learning paradigm of connexionist networks. In order to create the Artificial Neural Network - ANN, a database was created through the use of historical series from 2008 and 2009 of the daily pluviometric data (amount of rain accumulated in one day, in millimeters) collected from 21 meteorological stations located in a given Hydrographic Basin. Daily fluviometric data has also been used (river level, in centimeters) collected at the specific location the forecast is wanted. The data has been obtained and made available by the National Agency of Water (ANA - AgÊncia Nacional de Águas). In order to obtain an ANN that had a good generalization possibility and aiming at finding the number of neurons in the hidden layers, a number of experiments has been designed using feedforward network, supervised learning and backpropagation algorithm. The success of the experiments was based on the result of the average square error and linear regression of the network forecast obtained results. It was clear that the use of alternative techniques, such as the connexionist learning, in this case the ANNs to be used in flood forecasting systems, is appropriate and is highly relevant to improve the hydrological modeling techniques. The Itajaí-Açu River Basin has been chosen as the area of interest, with flood forecast for the city of Blumenau, in the State of Santa Catarina - Brazil. © 2010 IADIS.","Artificial Neural Networks; Flood forecast; Hydrographical basins","Area of interest; Artificial Neural Network; Feed-forward network; Flood forecast; Flood forecasting; Hidden layers; Hydrographical basin; Hydrological modeling; Learning paradigms; Meteorological station; River basins; River levels; Specific location; Square errors; Backpropagation algorithms; Data mining; Experiments; Flood control; Floods; Intelligent agents; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Weather forecasting","Bousfield, P.; UNIVILLEBrazil",,,,9789728939236,,,"English","Proc.

They are compared with three classic filters and the features selected by the original C4.5 decision tree algorithm, as an embedded method.

The knowledge about the UoD is obtained from a variety of sources, all of which are mostly expressed in a natural language. It is correct to say that conceptual modeling is much similar to language translation i.e., identifying concepts that are represented by signs of a language, and then representing those same concepts in a different language. Also, the semantic quality of the resulting model (translation) is directly affected by the modeler's (translator's) understanding of the source material. As so, conceptual modeling activities can benefit from an analysis carried out from a linguistic point of view, as well as from the use of a modeling language which constructs allow for a representation that is semantically equivalent to the natural language original descriptions. This work proposes a linguistic approach to conceptual modeling based on the notion of semantic types, and on the use of OntoUML as a modeling language.

Moreover, well-known static analysis algorithms do not support the incremental extraction of information from the legacy code. Large legacy systems can benefit from an incremental analysis strategy in order to provide iterative information extraction as well as to achieve partial results much earlier. This paper discusses a new approach for business knowledge extraction from legacy systems.

However, some problems are computationally intensive when it concerns the evaluation of solutions during the search process, making the optimization by evolutionary algorithms a slow process for situations where a quick response from the algorithm is desired (for instance, in online optimization problems). Several ways to overcome this problem, by speeding up convergence time, were proposed, including Cultural Algorithms and Coevolutionary Algorithms. However, these algorithms still have the need to evaluate many solutions on each step of the optimization process. In problems where this evaluation is computationally expensive, the optimization can take a prohibitive time to reach optimal solutions. This work presents an evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization problems (Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm for Problems based on Numerical Representation - QIEA-R), inspired in the concept of quantum superposition, which allows the optimization process to be carried on with a smaller number of evaluations. It extends previous works by presenting a broader range of tests and improvements on the algorithm.

Current automatic labeling techniques usually scale super linearly with the data size, and/or they fail when only a tiny amount of labeled data is provided. In this paper, we propose QMAS (Querying, Mining And Summarization of Multi-modal Databases), a fast solution to the following problems: (i) low-labor labeling (L3) - given a collection of images, very few of which are labeled with keywords, find the most suitable labels for the remaining ones; and (ii) mining and attention routing - in the same setting, find clusters, the top-NO outlier images, and the top-NR representative images. We report experiments on real satellite images, two large sets (1.5GB and 2.25GB) of proprietary images and a smaller set (17MB) of public images. We show that QMAS scales linearly with the data size, being up to 40 times faster than top competitors (GCap), obtaining better or equal accuracy. In contrast to other methods, QMAS does low-labor labeling (L3), that is, it works even with tiny initial label sets. It also solves both presented problems and spots tiles that potentially require new labels. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Automatic labeling; Data size; Fast solutions; Following problem; Label sets; Labeled data; Multimodal database; Public image; Satellite images; Knowledge based systems; Data mining","Cordeiro, R.

The problem is approached with a reasoning-based strategy that takes into account the relations among the alternatives discovered by means of a data mining technique. The problem of choosing a combination of different vegetables based on the synergistic effects of the combination and considering some socioeconomic variables is taken as a case study. The idea is to identify combinations that lead to gains in productivity, profitability, and lower costs. Experts recognize that some combinations of cultures can generate synergistic effects that can lead to profits or losses, depending on the production variables involved. However, the analysis of the results of the cultivation of multiple varieties involves a space of possibilities whose treatment is not trivial. Among the alternatives available, this study explored the Combinatorial Neural Model (CNM) that assures the hypotheses generation for all possible combinations, within limits defined by the model parameters. The study was carried out on data collected from farms in the Brazilian Federal District. Two approaches to the problem are presented: (i) the first one based on univariate and bi-dimensional data analysis and (ii) a multidimensional analysis based on the CNM results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Data mining; Farming systems; Reasoning-based systems","Data analysis; Data mining techniques; Farming system; Hypotheses generation; Lower cost; Model parameters; Multidimensional analysis; Neural models; Production variables; Reasoning-based systems; Synergistic effect; Univariate; Data reduction; Knowledge based systems; Profitability; Data mining","Do Prado, H.

We describe here the development and use of a bioinformatic pipeline tool, made publicly available under the name of EST2TSE, for the in silico detection of candidate genes with tissue-specific expression. Using this tool we mined the human EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) database for sequences derived exclusively from melanoma. We found 29 UniGene clusters of multiple ESTs with the potential to predict novel genes with melanoma-specific expression. Using a diverse panel of human tissues and cell lines, we validated the expression of a subset of three previously uncharacterized genes (clusters Hs.295012, Hs.518391, and Hs.559350) to be highly restricted to melanoma/melanocytes and named them RMEL1, 2 and 3, respectively. Expression analysis in nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas revealed RMEL1 as a novel melanocytic lineage-specific gene up-regulated during melanoma development. RMEL2 expression was restricted to melanoma tissues and glioblastoma. RMEL3 showed strong up-regulation in nevi and was lost in metastatic tumors. Interestingly, we found correlations of RMEL2 and RMEL3 expression with improved patient outcome, suggesting tumor and/or metastasis suppressor functions for these genes. The three genes are composed of multiple exons and map to 2q12.2, 1q25.3, and 5q11.2, respectively. They are well conserved throughout primates, but not other genomes, and were predicted as having no coding potential, although primate-conserved and human-specific short ORFs could be found. Hairpin RNA secondary structures were also predicted. Concluding, this work offers new melanoma-specific genes for future validation as prognostic markers or as targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat melanoma. © 2010 Sousa et al.",,"short hairpin RNA; article; bioinformatics; cancer inhibition; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell lineage; chromosome 1q; chromosome 21q; chromosome 5q; computer model; controlled study; data base; data mining; drug targeting; exon; expressed sequence tag; gene; gene cluster; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene mapping; genetic conservation; genome; glioblastoma; human; human cell; human tissue; melanocyte; melanoma; metastasis; nevus; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; outcome assessment; prediction; primary tumor; primate; prognosis; RMEL1 gene; RMEL2 gene; RMEL3 gene; RNA structure; upregulation; animal; genetics; information retrieval; primate; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; validation study; Primates; Animals; Expressed Sequence Tags; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Melanoma; Primates; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Up-Regulation","Espreafico, E.

Variable-Length Encryption Method (VLE) was proposed where a alternative algorithm with extra bits is adopted when pre-image computation is not possible. If an adequate secret key is used with VLE it is expected that the final ciphertext length is close to plaintext size. Several CA static parameters were calculated for a set formed by all radius 2 right-toggle rules. A database was generated associating rules performance in VLE ciphering with its parameters. A genetic algorithm-based data mining was performed to discover an adequate key specification based on CA parameters. Using such specification, ciphertext length is short, encryption process returns high entropy and VLE has a good protection against differential cryptanalysis. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Cellular Automata; cryptography; data mining; genetic algorithm; pre-image computation","Alternative algorithms; Cellular automata models; Ciphertexts; Differential cryptanalysis; Encryption methods; Image computation; Plaintext; Secret key; Static parameters; Automata theory; Cellular automata; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Pattern recognition systems; Problem solving; Specifications; Cryptography","Oliveira, G.

When data are endowed with Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort is necessary to compute the needed distances, making multidimensional projection prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data. The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in previous methods. © 2006 IEEE.","Dimensionality Reduction; Projection Methods; Streaming Technique; Visual Data Mining","Cartesian coordinate; Cartesians; Computational effort; Dimensionality reduction; Distance information; High dimensional data; High dimensional spaces; Interactivity; Large datasets; Massive data; Massive data sets; Multivariate data; Phase mappings; Projection method; Projection techniques; Representative sample; Streaming data; Streaming Technique; Visual data mining; Visual space; Data mining; Metadata; Data processing","Paulovich, F.

In part, it is because database designers do not think about data mining during the conceptual design of a database, therefore data are not prepared for mining. This problem increases for spatio-temporal data generated by mobile devices, which involve both space and time. In this paper we propose a novel solution to reduce the gap between databases and data mining in the domain of trajectories of moving objects, aiming to reduce the effort for data preprocessing. We propose a general framework for modeling trajectory patterns during the conceptual design of a database. The proposed framework is a result of several works including different data mining case studies and experiments performed by the authors on trajectory data modeling and trajectory data mining. It has been validated with a data mining query language implemented in PostGIS, that allows the user to create, instantiate and query trajectory data and trajectory patterns. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","conceptual model; data mining; trajectory data; trajectory patterns","Conceptual data models; Conceptual model; Data mining queries; Data preprocessing; Moving objects; Novel solutions; Space and time; Spatio-temporal data; trajectory data; Trajectory pattern; trajectory patterns; Conceptual design; Data mining; Information science; Mobile devices; Query languages; Trajectories","Bogorny, V.; Depto. de Informatica e Estatistica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitario, C.P. 476, Florianopolis, Brazil; email: vania@inf.ufsc.br",,,03029743,3642152996; 9783642152993,,,"English","Lect.

Because flexible-receptor docking simulations generate large amounts of data, their manual analysis is impractical. We intend to apply classification decision trees algorithms to better understand this type of docking results. However, prior to that we need to discretize the target attribute, which in this work is the estimated Free Energy of Binding (FEB) of the flexible receptor-ligand interactions. Here we compare three different discretization methods, by equal frequency (1), by equal width (2) and our proposed method, based on the mode and standard deviation (3) of the FEB values. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","data mining; discretization; flexible receptor; molecular docking","Classification decision; Discretization method; Discretizations; Docking simulations; flexible receptor; Free energy of binding; Intermolecular recognition; Large amounts of data; Manual analysis; Molecular docking; Receptor-ligand interactions; Standard deviation; Trees algorithm; Data mining; Decision trees; Discrete event simulation; Docking; Ligands; Molecular modeling; Bioinformatics","Machado, K.

As computers become cheaper, there is an increase in data storage for the production management process. Data Mining has appeared as a technique to identify new and useful knowledge in databases. The objective of this work was to explore the Decision Tree technique in hatchery databases to identify the best standards of the incubation process. The data set used in this research was supplied by Hy-Line do Brasil Ltda., corresponding to the incubation period of 2002-2006, from the strain Hy-line W-36. Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, values higher than the company's standards for saleable females were identified as relevant to generate the rules. In the second experiment, values below those established by the company were identified as relevant for the generation of rules. Entropy C 4.5 algorithm and the software SAS-Enterprise Miner were used for data analysis. The conclusion is that, with the technique studied, the data used for production management are sufficient to identify new, useful and applicable knowledge in order to increase productivity of hatcheries, catering for the demand with less waste.","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; KDD; Poultry science",,"Rodrigues, L.

The underlying, or hidden, chain is derived from the acronym, where the states in the chain are made by the acronyms characters. The transition between two states happens when the origin state emits a signal. Signals recognizable by the HMM are the tokens extracted from text. Observations are the sequence of tokens also extracted from text. Given a set of observations, the acronym definition will be the observation with the highest probability to emerge from the HMM. Modeling this extraction probabilistically allows us to deal with two difficult aspects of this process: ambiguity and noise. We characterize ambiguity when there is no unique alignment between the characters in the acronym with a token in the expansion, while the feature-characterizing noise is the absence of such alignment. Our experiments have proven that this approach has high precision (93.50%) and recall (85.50%) rates in an environment, where acronym coinage is ambiguous and noisy, such as the biomedical domain. Processing and comparing the approached described in this paper with different others showed that the former reaches the highest F1 score (89.40%) on the same corpus. © 2010 IEEE.","Acronym extraction; biomedical text analysis; hidden Markov models (HMMs); information extraction","Acronym extraction; Biomedical domain; Biomedical text; High precision; Information Extraction; Stochastic process; Two-state; Alignment; Character recognition; Information analysis; Random processes; Stochastic models; Hidden Markov models; accuracy; ambiguity; article; hidden Markov model; language; noise; nomenclature; recall; statistics; data mining; electronic medical record; factual database; human; information retrieval; medical informatics; medical research; methodology; probability; Abbreviations as Topic; Biomedical Research; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Markov Chains; Medical Informatics Applications","Osiek, B.

Proteins containing tetratricopeptide (TPR), pentatricopeptide (PPR) and half-a-TPR (HAT) repeats comprise the TPR-like superfamily in which we have applied MRDM methods (relational association rule discovery and probabilistic relational models) with hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Viterbi algorithm (VA) in genome databases of pathogenic protozoa Leishmania. Such integrated MRDM/HMM/VA approach seeks to capture as much model information as possible in the pattern matching heuristic, without resorting to more standard motif discovery methods (Pfam, SMART, SUPERFAMILY) and it has the advantage of incorporation of optimized profiles, score offsets and distribution to compute probability, as a more recently reported tool (TPRpred) in order to take in account the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem and to be widely distributed along the sequences. Here we compare such currently available resources with our approach (MRDM/HMM/VA) to highlight that the latter performs best into the TPR-like superfamily assignment and it might be applied to other sequence analysis problems in such a way that it contributes to tight-fit motif discoveries and a better probability that a given target sequence is, indeed, a target motif-containing protein. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to predict the cycle time of an injected part according to its molding parameters using a Rough-Neuro Fuzzy Network. The methodology involves the application of Fuzzy Sets to define inference morphology in order to insert the human knowledge about polymer processing into a structured rule bases. The attributes of the molding parameters are described using membership functions and converted on Fuzzy rules. The Rough Sets Theory identified which attributes and Fuzzy relation had more influence on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) surface response. Thus, rule bases filtrate by Rough Sets were used to train a back programmed Radial Basis Function (RBF) and/or a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neuro Fuzzy Network. In order to measure the performance of the proposed Rough-Neuro Fuzzy Network, the responses of the unreduced rule basis are compared with the reduced rule basis.

It usually employs a supervised learning strategy, where we first build a classification model using pre-classified documents and then use this model to classify unseen documents. The majority of supervised algorithms consider that all documents provide equally important information. However, in practice, a document may be considered more or less important to build the classification model according to several factors, such as its timeliness, the venue where it was published in, its authors, among others. In this paper, we are particularly concerned with the impact that temporal effects may have on ADC and how to minimize such impact. In order to deal with these effects, we introduce a temporal weighting function (TWF) and propose a methodology to determine it for document collections. We applied the proposed methodology to ACM-DL and Medline and found that the TWF of both follows a lognormal. We then extend three ADC algorithms (namely kNN, Rocchio and Naïve Bayes) to incorporate the TWF. Experiments showed that the temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains, outperforming (or at least matching) state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2010 ACM.","Classification and clustering; Text mining","Classification and clustering; Classification models; Classified documents; Document Classification; Document collection; Information retrieval problems; Log-normal; Medline; Rocchio; State-of-the-art algorithms; Supervised algorithm; Temporal effects; Temporal weighting functions; Text mining; Algorithms; Data mining; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Information retrieval","Salles, T.; Fed.

These additional terms can be obtained from documents stored in a database. Usually, this task is performed by clustering the documents and then extracting representative terms from the clusters. Afterwards, a new search is performed in the whole database using the expanded set of terms. Recently, the authors have proposed an immune-inspired algorithm, namely BIC-aiNet, to perform biclustering of texts. Biclustering differs from standard clustering algorithms in the sense that the former can detect partial similarities in the attributes. The preliminary results indicated that our proposal is able to group similar texts effectively and the generated biclusters consistently presented relevant words to represent a category of texts. Motivated by this promising scenario, this paper better formalizes the proposal and investigates the usefulness of the whole methodology on larger datasets. The BIC-aiNet was applied to a set of documents aiming at identifying the set of relevant terms associated with each bicluster, giving rise to a query expansion tool. The obtained results were compared with those produced by two alternative proposals in the literature, and they indicate that these techniques tend to generate complementary results, as a consequence of the use of distinct similarity metrics. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial immune systems; Biclustering; Information retrieval; Query expansion","algorithm; automation; controlled study; data base; data extraction; data mining; documentation; immune system; information retrieval; information storage; methodology; review","De Castro, P.

These criteria are endowed with particular features that may make each of them able to outperform others in specific classes of problems. In addition, they may have completely different computational requirements. Then, it is a hard task for the user to choose a specific criterion when he or she faces such a variety of possibilities. For this reason, a relevant issue within the field of clustering analysis consists of comparing the performances of existing validity criteria and, eventually, that of a new criterion to be proposed. In spite of this, the comparison paradigm traditionally adopted in the literature is subject to some conceptual limitations. The present paper describes an alternative, possibly complementary methodology for comparing clustering validity criteria and uses it to make an extensive comparison of the performances of 40 criteria over a collection of 962,928 partitions derived from five well-known clustering algorithms and 1080 different data sets of a given class of interest. A detailed review of the relative criteria under investigation is also provided that includes an original comparative asymptotic analysis of their computational complexities.

The use of remote sensing in many countries and states, where agricultural business is a large part of their gross income, can provide a valuable source to improve their economy. The combination of climate and remote sensing data can reveal useful information, which can help researchers to monitor and estimate the production of agricultural crops. Data mining techniques are the main tools to analyze and extract relationships and patterns. In this context, this paper presents a new algorithm for mining association patterns in Geo-referenced databases of climate and satellite images. The CLEARMiner (CLimatE Association patteRns Miner) algorithm identifies patterns in a time series and associates them with patterns in other series within a temporal sliding window. Experiments were performed with synthetic and real data of climate and NOAA-AVHRR sensor for sugar cane fields. Results show a correlation between agroclimate time series and vegetation index images. Rules generated by our new algorithm show the association patterns in different periods of time in each time series, pointing to a time delay between the occurrences of patterns in the series analyzed, corroborating what specialists usually forecast having the burden of dealing with many data charts. © 2010 ACM.","association rules; image-based information systems; NOAA-AVHRR images","Agricultural business; Agricultural crops; Agroclimate; Association patterns; Climate data; Data charts; Data mining techniques; Image-based; image-based information systems; Large parts; Mining associations; NOAA AVHRR; Remote sensing data; Satellite images; Sensor technologies; Sliding Window; Spatial data acquisition; Synthetic and real data; Vegetation index; Algorithms; Association rules; Associative processing; Crops; Information systems; Java programming language; Remote sensing; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar cane; Technology transfer; Time series; Vegetation; Data mining","Romani, L.

Since generating optimal model trees is a NP-Complete problem, the traditional model tree induction algorithms make use of a greedy heuristic, which may not converge to the global optimal solution. We propose the use of the evolutionary algorithms paradigm (EA) as an alternate heuristic to generate model trees in order to improve the convergence to global optimal solutions.

The analysis of mining patterns for assessing the knowledge they reveal is a critical phase in WUM. The main challenges are: (a) mining algorithms yield a huge number of patterns and (b) there is a significant semantic gap between URLs and events performed by users. In this paper, we describe the pattern analysis mechanisms integrated in O3R (Ontology-based Rules Retrieval and Rummaging), a human-centered environment for the analysis of navigation rules. O3R explores the synergy of mechanisms for retrieving and analyzing patterns. Filtering and clustering allow users to retrieve subsets of patterns with specific characteristics, in order to deal with the large volume of patterns. Rummaging mechanisms are targeted at assessing the meaning and relevance of pattern with regard to the domain, and it is particularly suitable for exploratory analysis. The distinctive feature of O3R is that is dynamically associates meaning to patterns using the concepts and relationships of a domain ontology, as a means of reducing the gap between syntactic URLs and semantic events performed by users. The paper describes the mechanisms in detail, and explores their synergic integration in the O3R prototype. It also reports two case studies that evaluate the use of O3R for the analysis of navigation patterns of a learning site. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such distortion is called ionospheric scintillation. These ionospheric irregularities occur as part of depleted plasma density regions that are generated at the magnetic equator after sunset by equatorial ionospheric plasma instability mechanism. Also known as ionospheric bubbles, they drift upward to high altitudes at the equator and extend/expand to low latitudes along the Earth magnetic field lines. Ionospheric irregularities affect the space weather since they present large variations with the solar cycle and during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. In general, navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System and telecommunications systems are also affected by the scintillation. The aim of this work is to apply data mining for the prediction of ionospheric scintillation. Data mining can be divided into two categories: descriptive or predictive. The first one describes a data set in a concise and summarized way, while the second one, used in this work, analyzes the data to build a model and tries to predict the behavior of a new data set. In this study we employed data series of ionospheric scintillation and other parameters such as the level of solar activity, vertical drift velocity of the plasma at the magnetic equator, and magnetic activity. The results show that prediction of the ionospheric scintillation occurrence during the analyzed period was possible regardless of the high variability of the ionospheric parameters that affect the generation of such irregularities.

In the model, glyphs are defined with multiple network attributes and clustered with the recursive optimization algorithm for dimensional reduction. The user's visual latency time is incorporated into the recursive process so that it updates the display and the optimization model according to the human factor and maximizes the capacity of real-time computation. The interactive search interface is developed to enable the display of similar data points according to their similarity of attributes. Finally, typical network anomalous events are analyzed and visualized such as password guessing, etc. This technology is expected to have an impact on real-time visual data mining for network security, sensor networks and many other multivariable real-time monitoring systems. Our usability study shows a decent accuracy of context-independent glyph identification (89.37%) with a high precision for anomaly detection (94.36%). The results indicate that, without any context, users tend to classify unknown patterns as possibly harmful. On the other hand, in the dynamic clustering (context-dependent) experiment, clusters of very extremely unusual glyphs normally contain fewer packets.

To assess the diversity of this protein family in coffee (Coffea spp.), data mining methods were used on a set of around 200,000 coffee expressed sequence tags. A total of 53 different putative WRKY genes were obtained, but only 22 unigenes encoding a protein with a WRKY domain were identified, eight of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Alignment of WRKY domain sequences of the coffee unigenes and 72 Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY genes showed that the 22 coffee WRKY members were distributed among the main A. thaliana WRKY subgroups and shared conserved peptide domains. To assess the involvement of WRKY genes in coffee defense response pathways, their expression was analyzed under biotic (nematode and rust fungus infection), hormonal (salicylic acid, methyl-jasmonate), and wounding treatments, leaf senescence, and fruit development. Five members of WRKY groups IId and III were regulated only by pathogens and hormone treatments. Although a significant correlation of WRKY genes expression after MeJA and rust treatments was observed, expression of coffee genes involved in JA biosynthesis and lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.12) activity assays did not support the involvement of JA in the early coffee resistance responses to the rust pathogen. The five WRKY transcription factor members identified might play important roles as regulators of pathogen resistance responses and could be useful for improving coffee tolerance to various biotic stresses. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Coffea arabica; Regulator genes; Rust disease","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Coffea; Coffea arabica; Uredinales","Fernandez, D.; UMR 186 IRD-UM2-Cirad Résistance des Plantes aux Bioagresseurs, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, BP64501, Montpellier Cedex 5 34032, France; email: Diana.Fernandez@ird.fr",,,16142942,,,,"English","Tree Genet.

Several single optimality criterion have been proposed for the phylogenetic reconstruction problem. However, different criteria may lead to conflicting phylogenies. In this scenario, a multi-objective approach can be useful since it could produce a set of optimal trees according to multiple criteria. PhyloMOEA is a multi objective evolutionary approach applied to phylogenetic inference using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria. On the other hand, the computational power required for phylogenetic inference of large alignments easily surpasses the capabilities of single machines. In this context, the parallelization of the heuristic reconstruction methods can not only help to reduce the inference execution time but also improve the results quality and search robustness. On the other hand, The PhyloMOEA parallelization represents the next development step in order to reduce the execution time.

If, on one hand, this method has proven to be very efficient for error estimation, on the other hand, little attention has been paid to the resulting sensitivity. Only two scores are normally used and thresholds are explored in a very simplistic way. In this work, a multivariate decoy analysis is described, where many quality parameters are considered. This analysis is treated in our approach as an optimization problem for sensitivity maximization. Furthermore, an efficient heuristic is proposed to solve this problem. Experiments comparing our method, termed MUDE (multivariate decoy database analysis), with traditional bivariate decoy analysis and with Peptide/ProteinProphet showed that our procedure significantly enhances the retrieved number of identifications when comparing the same false discovery rates.

Existing spatial association rule mining algorithms are Apriori-like, and therefore generate a large amount of redundant patterns. For non-spatial data, the closed frequent pattern mining technique has been introduced to remove redundant patterns. This approach, however, does not warrant the elimination of both redundant and well known geographic dependences when mining geographic databases. This paper presents a novel method for pruning both redundant and well known geographic dependences, by pushing semantics into the pattern mining task. Experiments with real geographic databases have demonstrated a significant reduction of the total amount of patterns and the efficiency of the method. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Closed sets; Semantic data mining; Spatial association rules; Spatial data mining","Apriori; Association rule mining; Closed set; Frequent pattern mining; Geographic database; Geographic pattern; Knowledge resource; Novel methods; Pattern mining; Redundant patterns; Semantic data; Spatial association rule mining; Spatial association rules; Spatial data; Spatial data mining; Association rules; Associative processing; Database systems; Ontology; Semantics; Data mining; algorithm; data mining; data set; database; spatial data","Bogorny, V.; Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

This paper addresses the problem of manufacturing cell formation using a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The main modification that this work made to the original PSO algorithm consists in not using the vector of velocities that the standard PSO algorithm does. The proposed algorithm uses the concept of proportional likelihood with modifications, a technique that is used in data mining applications. Some simulation results are presented and compared with results from literature. The criterion used to group the machines into cells is based on the minimization of intercell movements. The computational results show that the PSO algorithm is able to find the optimal solutions in almost all instances, and its use in machine grouping problems is feasible. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, knowledge exchange may often be characterized by miscommunication leading to misinterpretation, ultimately resulting in errors in research and even clinical practice. Though communication has a central role in interdisciplinary collaboration and since miscommunication can have a negative impact on research processes, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explored how data analysis specialists and clinical researchers communicate over time. Methods/Principal Findings: We conducted qualitative analysis of encounters between clinical researchers and data analysis specialists (epidemiologist, clinical epidemiologist, and data mining specialist). These encounters were recorded and systematically analyzed using a grounded theory methodology for extraction of emerging themes, followed by data triangulation and analysis of negative cases for validation. A policy analysis was then performed using a system dynamics methodology looking for potential interventions to improve this process. Four major emerging themes were found. Definitions using lay language were frequently employed as a way to bridge the language gap between the specialties. Thought experiments presented a series of ""what if"" situations that helped clarify how the method or information from the other field would behave, if exposed to alternative situations, ultimately aiding in explaining their main objective. Metaphors and analogies were used to translate concepts across fields, from the unfamiliar to the familiar. Prolepsis was used to anticipate study outcomes, thus helping specialists understand the current context based on an understanding of their final goal. Conclusion/Significance: The communication between clinical researchers and data analysis specialists presents multiple challenges that can lead to errors. © 2010 Zammar et al.",,"article; clinical research; data analysis; interdisciplinary communication; literature; methodology; qualitative analysis; human; medical research; peer review; personnel; public relations; qualitative research; questionnaire; standard; theoretical model; Prolepsis; Biomedical Research; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Interprofessional Relations; Models, Theoretical; Peer Review, Research; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Research Design; Research Personnel","Zammar, G.

The data were used to estimate pairwise genetic distances between the genotypes. A neighbor-joining based dendrogram was used to define clusters and infer possible genetic structuring of the collection. Most microsatellites were polymorphic (73%), with an observed number of alleles per locus ranging from one to eleven. The levels of observed and expected heterozygosity for 51 polymorphic loci varied from 0.00 to 0.85 and from 0.08 to 0.82, averaging 0.19 and 0.59, respectively. Forty-four percent of microsatellites showed polymorphism information content (PIC) higher than 0.50. The compound microsatellites seem to be more informative than dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats in average alleles per locus and PIC. Among dinucleotides, AG/TC or GA/CT repeat motifs exhibited more informativeness than TA/AT, GT/CA and TG/AC repeat motifs. The neighbor-joining analysis based on shared allele distance could differentiate all the papaya accessions and landraces as well as differences in their genetic structure. This set of markers will be useful for examining parentage, inbreeding and population structure in papaya. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Breeding; Germplasm; Microsatellites; Papaya; Polymorphism","Carica papaya","de Oliveira, E.

Such bioentities are often related to biological concepts of interest that are specific of a determined research field. Therefore, the study of the current literature about a selected topic deposited in public databases, facilitates the generation of novel hypotheses associating a set of bioentities to a common context.Results: We created a text mining system (LAITOR: Literature Assistant for Identification of Terms co-Occurrences and Relationships) that analyses co-occurrences of bioentities, biointeractions, and other biological terms in MEDLINE abstracts. The method accounts for the position of the co-occurring terms within sentences or abstracts. The system detected abstracts mentioning protein-protein interactions in a standard test (BioCreative II IAS test data) with a precision of 0.82-0.89 and a recall of 0.48-0.70. We illustrate the application of LAITOR to the detection of plant response genes in a dataset of 1000 abstracts relevant to the topic.Conclusions: Text mining tools combining the extraction of interacting bioentities and biological concepts with network displays can be helpful in developing reasonable hypotheses in different scientific backgrounds. © 2010 Barbosa-Silva et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Bio-entities; Plant response; Protein-protein interactions; Public database; Research fields; Scientific literature; Standard tests; Text mining; Data mining; Proteins; Abstracting; article; biology; computer program; data mining; information retrieval; MEDLINE; methodology; publication; United States; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Information Storage and Retrieval; MEDLINE; Publications; Software; United States","Ortega, J.M.; Laboratório de Biodados, Dpto. de Bioquímica e Imunologia, ICB - UFMG. 31270-901, Belo Horizonte - MG, Brazil; email: miguel@icb.ufmg.br",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"20122157","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949510039

In case of system unavailability, the companies are financially penalized, more severely, on unplanned interruptions. This work presents a domain driven data mining approach for estimating the risk of systems' unavailability based on their component equipments historical data, within one of the biggest Brazilian electric sector companies. Traditional statistical estimators are combined with the concepts of Recency, Frequency and Impact (RFI) for producing variables containing behavioral information finely tuned to the application domain. The unavailability costs are embedded in the problem modeling strategy. Logistic regression models bagged via their median score achieved Max-KS=0.341 and AUC-ROC=0.699 on the out-of-time data sample. This performance is much higher than the previous approaches attempted within the company. The system has been put in operation and will be monitored for the performance re-assessment and maintenance re-planning. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Domain driven data mining; Electrical power grid unavailability; Equipment unavailability penalties; Logistic regression; Model ensembles","Electric power transmission networks; Frequency estimation; Intelligent systems; Regression analysis; Risk perception; Distributing companies; Domain-driven data minings; Electrical power; Logistic regression models; Logistic regressions; Model ensembles; Statistical estimators; System unavailability; Data mining","Adeodato, P.

The large data sets of high dimensionality and the large amount of records inserted into databases are non-trivial problems-when conducting a search for ""knowledge"" through the data. This paper introduces a study using Visual Data Mining (VDM) algorithms integrating Data Mining (DM) techniques with Visualization of Information (VI) techniques to analyze the data collected at Itaipu dam. The main objective was to establish relationships between the variables in order to detect undesirable failures that can compromise the security and integrity of the dam. More information may be more easily extracted when different techniques of Visualization of Information, together with techniques of Data Mining, are applied for data analysis. The visual analysis of the data has proved efficient in detecting patterns of anomalies, and thus it can be considered a valuable tool to support decision making.","Dam monitoring; Data mining; Information visualization; KDD process; Visual Data Mining",,"Neto, M.

Methods: Exploratory research carried out in Curitiba, Southern Brazil, in 2007. It was divided into three phases: the identification of attributes to classify a micro-area; the construction of a database; and the process of discovering knowledge in a database through the use of data mining. The set of attributes included the conditions of infrastructure; hydrography; soil; recreation area; community characteristics; and existence of vectors. The database was constructed with data obtained in interviews by community health workers using questionnaires with closed-ended questions, developed with the essential attributes selected by specialists. Results: There were 49 attributes identified, 41 of which were essential and eight irrelevant. There were 68 rules obtained in the data mining, which were analyzed through the perspectives of performance and quality and divided into two sets: the inconsistent rules and the rules that confirm the knowledge of experts. The comparison between the groups showed that the rules that confirm the knowledge, despite having lower computational performance, were considered more interesting. Conclusions: The data mining provided a set of useful and understandable rules capable of characterizing risk areas based on the characteristics of the physical environment. The use of the proposed rules allows a faster and less subjective area classification, maintaining a standard between the health teams and overcoming the influence of individual perception by each team member.","Artificial intelligence; Databases as topic; Databases, factual; Environmental Indicators; Environmental risks; Knowledge bases; Risk map",,"Malucelli, A.; A/C PPGIa, R.

Supposing that every viewer has a Bluetooth enabled cell phone, each mobile will identify one spectator to the set-top box wirelessly. Since the set-top box used is a Playstation 3, it is a full computer with IBM Cell BE processor capable of executing computer-intensive algorithms. This device was used to store the history of programs watched by every person near the TV connected to the set-top box, and to identify their profile and preferences using data mining algorithms.

Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology in order to automate the sugarcane mapping task when remote sensing data are used. Thus the integration of two major approaches of Artificial Intelligence, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM), were tested in a study area located in São Paulo state, which is well representative of the agriculture of large regions of Brazil and other countries. OBIA was used to emulate the interpreter knowledge in the process of sugarcane mapping, and DM techniques were employed for automatic generation of knowledge model. A time series of four Landsat images was acquired in order to represent the wide variability of the patterns during sugarcane crop season. Definiens Developer® multiresolution segmentation algorithm produced the objects and properly trained decision tree applied to the Landsat data for the generation of the thematic map with sugarcane as the main class of interest. An overall accuracy of 94% (Kappa = 0,87) was obtained, showing that OBIA and DM are very efficient and promising in the direction of automating the sugarcane classification process with Landsat multitemporal time series.","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Landsat images; Object-based image analysis; Sugarcane mapping","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision trees; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Mapping; Maps; Remote sensing; Time series; Trees (mathematics); Automatic Generation; Classification process; Landsat images; Multiresolution segmentation; Object based image analysis; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Overall accuracies; Remote sensing data; Data mining","Formaggio, A.R.; INPE, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas, Espaciais, 12, Brazil","Van Coillie F.M.B.Addink E.A.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing",16821750,,,,"English","Int.

Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate soil chemical attributes and sugarcane yield with the use of geostatistics and data mining by decision tree induction. Sugarcane yield was mapped in a 23ha field, applying the cell criterion, by using a yield monitor that allowed the elaboration of a digital map representing the surface of production of the studied area. To determine the soil attributes, soil samples were collected at the beginning of the harvest in 2006/2007 using a regular grid of 50 x 50m, in the depths of 0.0-0.2m and 0.2-0.4m. Soil attributes and sugarcane yield data were analyzed by using geostatistics techniques and were classified into three yield levels for the elaboration of the decision tree. The decision tree was induced in the software SAS Enterprise Miner, using an algorithm based on entropy reduction. Altitude and potassium presented the highest values of correlation with sugarcane yield. The induction of decision trees showed that the altitude is the variable with the greatest potential to interpret the sugarcane yield maps, then assisting in precision agriculture and, revealing an adjusted tool for the study of management definition zones in area cropped with sugarcane.","Data mining; Precision agriculture; Spatial variability; Yield monitor",,"de Souza, Z.

Knowledge-based interpretation arises as an effective way to interpret remote sensing imagery. In this approach, human's expertise is organized in a knowledge base to be used as input of automated interpretation processes, thus enhancing performance and accuracy, and reducing at the same time the subjectivity in the interpretation process. Some systems such as Definiens, ENVI-FX, and more recently, InterIMAGE, have incorporated useful tools to aid the object-oriented classification. In this context, this work presents a system for object image analysis, called Geographical Data Mining Analyst (GeoDMA), which implements several mechanisms for automatic image interpretation. It performs image segmentation, objects feature extraction, supervised and unsupervised classification with raster, shape and cellular data sets. GeoDMA has been used for intra-urban land cover classification of high spatial resolution images and also to detect deforestation patterns in the Brazilian Amazon. Such different applications warrant the generalist behavior of the system. In this article, we discuss each module implemented in the system, the integration of objects obtained by segmentation to extract texture features and landscape metrics. We also show the main tools for data preprocessing, sample selection and feature visualization. Finally, one application of automatic urban interpretation is shown.","Data mining; Decision trees; Image classification; Neural networks; Self-organizing maps","Classification (of information); Conformal mapping; Data visualization; Decision trees; Deforestation; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image classification; Image segmentation; Knowledge based systems; Mobile security; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Self organizing maps; Trees (mathematics); Automated interpretation; Deforestation patterns; High spatial resolution images; Object oriented classification; Object-oriented analysis; Remote sensing imagery; Supervised and unsupervised classification; Urban land cover classification; Data mining",,"Van Coillie F.M.B.Addink E.A.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing",16821750,,,,"English","Int.

The leaves were collected at regular intervals of 50 m, totaling 332 sampling points. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, geostatistics and induction of decision tree. With the aid of digital elevation model (MDE) and the profile planaltimetric, the area was divided into three different landrelief and sub-strands. The highest values for nutrients from the leaves of citrus were observed at the top (concave area) segments on a half-slope and lower slope. The nutrients from the citrus leaves showed high values of correlation (above 0.5) with the altitude of the study area.

Some software engineering publishers have began to collaborate with research groups to make available repositories of software engineering empirical data. However, these initiatives are limited due to issues related to the available search tools. As a result, many researchers in the area have adopted a semi-automated approach for performing searches for systematic reviews as a mean to extract empirical evidence from published material.

The Segmentation Parameter Tuner system was used for the search of appropriate segmentation parameters. This system uses a genetic algorithm for the optimization of the parameters. For the description of the land cover classes in terms of features and thresholds, a strategy combining a hierarchical structure of classes and the decision tree algorithm C4.5 was elaborated. The classification model was then formatted according to InterIMAGE's image analysis strategy. The proposed methodology has shown to be efficient for the automatic mapping of the land cover in complex urban areas such as those found in the metropolis of São Paulo.

Heat wave prediction and characterization may allow early mitigation actions to be taken. Data Mining is one of the tools used for such a characterization, particularly when a large number of variables is involved. The objective of this study was to classify heat waves that promote broiler chicken mortality in poultry houses equipped with minimal environmental control. A single day of heat, a heat-shock day, is capable of producing high broiler mortality. In poultry houses equipped with fans and evaporative cooling, the characterization of heat waves affecting broiler mortality between 29 days of age and market age presented 89.34% Model Accuracy and 0.73 Class Precision for high mortality. There was no influence on high mortality (HM) of birds between 29 and 31 days of age. Maximum temperature humidity index (THI) above 30.6 °C was the main characteristic of days when there was a heat wave, causing high mortality in broilers older than 31 days. The high mortality of broilers between 31 and 40 days of age occurred when maximum THI was above 30.6 °C and maximum temperature of the day was above 34.4 °C. There were two main causes of high mortality of broilers older than 40 days: 1) maximum THI above 30.6°C and minimum THI equal or lower than 15.5 °C; 2) maximum THI above 30.6 °C, minimum THI lower than 15.5°C, and the time of maximum temperature later than 15:00h.

Potential epitopes can be identified with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding algorithms, and the ability to bind to MHC class I or class II indicates a predominantly CD4+ or CD8+ T cell response. Furthermore, an epitope-based vaccine can circumvent evolutionary events favoring immune escape present in native proteins from pathogens. It can also focus on only the most relevant epitopes (i.e. conserved and promiscuous) recognized by the majority of the target population. Mounting evidence points to the critical role of CD4+ T cells in natural antigen encounter and active immunization. In this paper the need for CD4+ T cell help in vaccine development, the selection of CD4+ T cell epitopes for an epitope-based vaccine, and how the approach can be used to induce a protective effect are reviewed. © 2010 L.

How are they connected? What are the central nodes and the outliers of the graphs? We show that the Radius Plot (pdf of node radii) can answer these questions. However, computing the Radius Plot is prohibitively expensive for graphs reaching the planetary scale. There are two major contributions in this paper: (a) We propose HADI (HAdoop DIameter and radii estimator), a carefully designed and fine-tuned algorithm to compute the diameter of massive graphs, that runs on the top of the HADOOP/MAPREDUCE system, with excellent scale-up on the number of available machines (b) We run HADI on several real world datasets including YahooWeb (6B edges, 1/8 of a Terabyte), one of the largest public graphs ever analyzed. Thanks to HADI, we report fascinating patterns on large networks, like the surprisingly small effective diameter, the multi-modal/bi-modal shape of the Radius Plot, and its palindrome motion over time.

A renewable resource and the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose, chitin is currently used for waste water clearing, cosmetics, medical, and veterinary applications. This work comprises data mining of protein sequences related to the chitin metabolic pathway of completely sequenced genomes of extant organisms pertaining to the three life domains, followed by meta-analysis using traditional sequence similarity comparison and complex network approaches. Complex networks involving proteins of the chitin metabolic pathway in extant organisms were constructed based on protein sequence similarity. Several usual network indices were estimated in order to obtain information on the topology of these networks, including those related to higher order neighborhood properties. Due to the assumed evolutionary character of the system, we also discuss issues related to modularity properties, with the concept of edge betweenness playing a particularly important role in our analysis. Complex network approach correctly identifies clusters of organisms that belong to phylogenetic groups without any a priori knowledge about the biological features of the investigated protein sequences. We envisage the prospect of using such a complex network approach as a high-throughput phylogenetic method. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Chitin; Comparative genomics; Complex networks","chitin; chitin; protein; chitin; comparative study; complexity; genome; genomics; meta-analysis; metabolism; microorganism; phylogenetics; protein; topology; amino acid sequence; article; comparative gene mapping; gene cluster; high throughput screening; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; protein analysis; protein degradation; sequence analysis; archaeon; Bacteria; biological model; chemistry; computer simulation; eukaryote; metabolism; molecular genetics; physiology; sequence homology; signal transduction; species difference; Arthropoda; Amino Acid Sequence; Archaea; Bacteria; Chitin; Computer Simulation; Eukaryota; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity","Góes-Neto, A.; Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana, Departamento de Ciências Biológicas, Bairro Novo Horizonte, Feira de Santana, Av.

This event provides the raw material for the divergence of function in homeologous genes, leading to phenotypic novelty that can contribute to the success of polyploids in nature or their selection for use in agriculture. Mounting evidence underlined the existence of homeologous expression biases in polyploid genomes; however, strategies to analyze such transcriptome regulation remained scarce. Important factors regarding homeologous expression biases remain to be explored, such as whether this phenomenon influences specific genes, how paralogs are affected by genome doubling, and what is the importance of the variability of homeologous expression bias to genotype differences. This study reports the expressed sequence tag assembly of the allopolyploid Coffea arabica and one of its direct ancestors, Coffea canephora. The assembly was used for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms through the identification of high-quality discrepancies in overlapped expressed sequence tags and for gene expression information indirectly estimated by the transcript redundancy. Sequence diversity profiles were evaluated within C. arabica (Ca) and C. canephora (Cc) and used to deduce the transcript contribution of the Coffea eugenioides (Ce) ancestor. The assignment of the C. arabica haplotypes to the C. canephora (CaCc) or C. eugenioides (CaCe) ancestral genomes allowed us to analyze gene expression contributions of each subgenome in C. arabica. In silico data were validated by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific combination TaqMAMA-based method. The presence of differential expression of C. arabica homeologous genes and its implications in coffee gene expression, ontology, and physiology are discussed. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Coffea; Coffea arabica; Coffea canephora; Coffea eugenioides; Magnoliophyta","Pereira, G.

This qualification allows the use of KDD results to train a Bayesian Network (BN). The aim of the proposed BN is to support the performance diagnostic of electrical networks, promoting an indirect identification of forced outage causes. The analysis of the collected data during a forced outage indicates that the main purpose of field crews is a quick restoration of the network and, several times, the causes surrounding the outage events have a high level of subjectivity and uncertainty, turning impossible its direct identification. To illustrate the methodology, is presented a case with 570.000 events, where KDD provides a new environment - with a significant amount of data - more suitable to train and validate a BN to identification of forced outage causes.","Bayesian Network; Data mining; Database; Forced outage cause identification; Knowledge discovery in databases","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Database systems; Decision making; Investments; Restoration; Uncertainty analysis; Direct identifications; Distribution systems; Distribution utilities; Forced outages; Indirect identification; Knowledge discovery in database; Operation and maintenance; Performance diagnostics; Knowledge management","Tronchoni, A.

Some protein structure prediction methods utilize structural information from protein templates in order to build the structure of unknown proteins. Examining structural protein motifs in detail is highly difficult since the task of mapping from a local sequence of amino acid residues to a local 3-D protein structure is very complex. This study presents a new statistical fragment-based method to acquire structural information from small protein template samples (A3N - Artificial Neural Network n-gram-based). Structural data obtained from protein templates were used in order to train an artificial neural network. Afterwards, approximative 3-D polypeptides structures are built through the use of a sequence-to-structure mapping function. The efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated in four case studies of polypeptides whose sizes vary from 19 to 34 amino acids residues. As indicated by the RMSD values and Ramachandran Plot values, the results show that the predicted structures adopt a fold similar to the experimental structures. Thus, they can be used as input structures in refinement methods based on molecular mechanics (MM), e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The search space is expected to be greatly reduced and the ab initio methods can demand a much reduced computational time to achieve a more accurate polypeptide structure. We also discuss the results, future works and limitations of the proposed method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
