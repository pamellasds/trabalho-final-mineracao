However, the domain of knowledge contained in these games is large, which makes it difficult to discover and predict the course of a match. The present work proposes the application of classification algorithms to determine the team with more chances to win a match. Two classifications procedures were used, one based on the composition of heroes in each team and another considering the duration of the match. The experiments were performed on data collected from 123,326 matches of Dota 2, showing that it was possible to achieve approximately 77% accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the application when using techniques assisted by computers, and when using the methodology described in championships or other similar games that require the definition of strategies.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975774","Data Mining;Classification;Strategic Games","Games;Valves;Software;Creep;Monte Carlo methods;Classification algorithms;Computers","computer games;data mining;pattern classification","MOBA game winner prediction;multiplayer online battle arena games;e-sport scenario;team heroes;Dota 2;classification algorithms","","","8","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We used artificial fiducial markers to feed the visual controller. Therefore, three different methods for imaging enhancing were applied to the raw image aiming to increase the detection rate of the marker detector. Since the performance of the visual controller also depends on the detection time, this was also considered in the comparison. Finally, the algorithm that caused the best improvement in marker detection was tested in a visual servoing mission. The proposed methods have shown a significantly improvement in the marker detection rates and reasonable detection times for visual servoing of autonomous underwater vehicles. In terms of visual servoing missions, this work shows that the proposed methods not only increased the controller frequency, but also made visual servoing possible when water condition is not favorable and no marker can be detected without a pre-processing layer.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232222","","Visual servoing;Visualization;Detectors;Image resolution;Inspection","autonomous underwater vehicles;image enhancement;marine control;mobile robots;object detection;robot vision;visual servoing","visual servoing tasks;underwater image enhancement;image processing;visual servoing capability;autonomous underwater vehicle;image quality;artificial fiducial markers;visual controller;marker detection rates;preprocessing algorithms;underwater image formation","","","21","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These improved land cover classified images were named conditioned classified images. We aimed to classify one Synthetic Aperture Radar image and an optical one, both from June 2010, using two land cover legends in different level of detail for a region in the Brazilian Amazon. We used both a classified image from 2008 (also in two legends levels) and the data from the Programme for the Estimation of Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon (PRODES) from 2008 as base maps, and presented the likelihood of transitions between the considered classes. The proposed methodology resulted in conditioned classified images with higher Overall Accuracy than the one that does not consider the base maps and the likelihood of transitions. The conditioned classified images presented unlabeled areas due to classification errors in the input data.

Different techniques to extract information from polarimetric data, using an adequate statistical distribution are currently available. A region-based classifier for PolSAR data - named PolClass - uses a supervised approach to compare stochastic distances between scaled complex Wishart distributions and hypothesis tests to associate confidence levels into the classification results. In this paper, the integrated use of these distances together with the uncertainty maps is applied for the first time to detect oil slicks. A quad-pol Radarsat-2 data, acquired during one open-water controlled exercise, was used to perform this test. The PolClass achieved similar overall accuracies for four stochastic distances, reaching 96.54% of global accuracy, the best result obtained by the Hellinger distance. A comparison between the full- and dual-pol matrices indicated that the results obtained with the VV-HH-HV, HH-HV, and VV-HV polarizations are statistically equivalent, but different from that obtained using the HH-VV. Therefore, the exclusion of the HV channel affected the detection of only mineral oils. The classifier demonstrated the potential to detect the three types of oils released, being more effective in detecting biogenic oils rather than mineral oils. The uncertainty levels increase from the center to the border of the mineral oil slicks, indicating the presence of transition regions, possibly related to different weathering mechanisms. The proposed approach will contribute to the understanding of where different physical and chemical processes may be acting, associating confidence levels to the classification results.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2628325","CNPQ; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819529","Information theory;oil slicks detection;polarimetry;region-based classification;stochastic distances;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);uncertainty maps","Oils;Synthetic aperture radar;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Backscatter;Sea surface;Minerals","geophysical image processing;oils;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","oil slicks detection;polarimetric data;stochastic distances;complex Wishart distributions;polarimetric synthetic aperture radars;PolSAR data;PolClass;quad-pol Radarsat-2 data;mineral oils;biogenic oils;weathering mechanisms","","5","57","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the proper choice of systems parameters, high performance with respect to the suppression of range ambiguity and low range sidelobes can be achieved, indicating their high suitability for several applications. Furthermore, the random nature that underpins such technology evidences their inherent low probability of interception property, specially necessary in military systems. Despite such features, their usage in surveillance related applications, where targets velocity are unknown, is still limited, because they often present a near thumbtack ambiguity function, and, as a consequence, low Doppler tolerance. The latter becomes more critical in long range applications, where the transmission of long duration pulses are often desired to meet the system's power requirements. Within this context, relying on the referred waveforms stochastic properties, a subpulse processing technique is proposed, allowing the detection of fast targets in long range surveillance Noise Radars.","","978-1-78561-672-3","10.1049/cp.2017.0536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367621","Noise radar;Doppler tolerance;surveillance","","Doppler radar;military radar;probability;pulse compression;radar detection;radar interference;radar resolution;radar signal processing;random noise;search radar;stochastic processes;waveform analysis","military systems;thumbtack ambiguity function;long duration pulses;referred waveforms stochastic properties;subpulse processing technique;long range surveillance Noise Radars;general term;pulse compression radar systems;range ambiguity;low range sidelobes;interception property;Doppler tolerance;stochastic process","","2","","","28 May 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Relying on its stochastic properties, with the proper choice of system s parameters, high performance with respect to the suppression of range ambiguity and low range sidelobes can be achieved. Many works have been published in the literature addressing systems that transmit carriers modulated in amplitude by a given stochastic process, generally generated by a hardware noise source. Nevertheless, the characterization of random frequency modulation (more suitable for several applications) is still an on going subject matter. Within this context, in this paper closed form expressions of the narrowband ambiguity function of random frequency modulated signals are presented, and, as a consequence, its Doppler tolerance is better addressed.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944226","Noise radar;random waveform;ambiguity function","Frequency modulation;Doppler effect;Doppler radar;Stochastic processes;Narrowband","Doppler effect;FM radar;radar signal processing;random processes;stochastic processes;waveform analysis","near-thumbtack ambiguity function;random frequency modulated signals;noise radar;transmit waveforms;stochastic properties;range ambiguity suppression;low range sidelobes;transmit carriers;hardware noise source;closed form expressions;narrowband ambiguity function;Doppler tolerance","","6","11","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such cases, most subproblems can be solved independently by different processors. However, parallel processing is not suitable for some problems solved by nested Benders decomposition, due to the hierarchy between subproblems related to different time steps. In particular, for the deterministic case, parallel programming has been restricted to thread processing in lower-level machine computation and optimization solver codes. This paper proposes a new nested Benders decomposition strategy that is suitable for parallel processing, where time-coupled stages are solved simultaneously and an alternative procedure is employed to share initial conditions for the next stages as well as Benders cuts for the previous stages. The methodology is applied to the deterministic short term hydrothermal scheduling problem for the real large-scale Brazilian system, where the advantages of the proposed approach become more evident. In order to show the applicability of the method in low-budget and small parallel environments, the case study was processed with up to 24 process on multi-core computers.","1944-9933","978-1-5386-2212-4","10.1109/PESGM.2017.8274148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8274148","","Optimization;Scheduling;Parallel programming;Instruction sets;Processor scheduling","hydrothermal power systems;optimisation;parallel processing;parallel programming;power generation scheduling;stochastic programming","optimization strategies;parallel processing;mathematical-programming based decomposition strategies;parallel programming;thread processing;nested benders decomposition strategy;deterministic short term hydrothermal scheduling problem;parallel environments;two-stage Benders decomposition","","","","","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The knowledge base in this case is formed by the models of a function of distribution of droplet mean, ranges of the sprayer operating conditions for each nozzle and also by the drops classification standards. The previously obtained results from the knowledge base are thus organized in terms of the operating conditions in a controlled environment. The electrohydraulic operating conditions of the sprayer which includes speed and flow measurements are used to define experimental tests, perform calibration of the spray booms and select nozzle types. The evaluation of the quality of the application is based on the analysis of the normal distributions of volumetric mean diameters along with the information obtained from the knowledge base. Therefore, integrating measurements to a knowledge base can improve the decision-making in the adjustments required in agricultural spraying process, making possible the representation of the mean drop rates and the fitting of the drops mean diameters to a distribution function. The consistency of the analyzed data base and the independence between the data of each test were evaluated using the Grubbs test and the quartilequartile plot. Results show that the use of advanced models can help in the semantic interpretation of the quality of the agricultural sprayers and to improve decision-making processes.","","978-1-5090-4284-5","10.1109/ICSC.2017.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889576","Advanced modeling;quality of agricultural application;drop size distribution;agricultural sprayers","Standards;Spraying;Knowledge based systems;Agriculture;Databases;Bars","agriculture;decision making;normal distribution","knowledge base integration method;agricultural sprayers;decision making processes;electrohydraulic operating conditions;normal distributions;volumetric mean diameters;Grubbs test;quartilequartile plot","","","14","","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the scope of the maritime nautical charts, paper charts have been evolved into electronic navigational charts (ENC), vector data comprising the environment features relevant to navigation. Regarding the river nautical charts, following same tendency, another product specification was created: the Inland ENC, similar to the maritime ENC, but adapted to the fluvial environment. This paper aims to compare an Inland ENC derived from a singlebeam survey, using traditional cartographic approach and another Inland ENC produced directly from multibeam survey data in the Paraguay River, which was chosen as a study area for the first Brazilian Inland ENCs.

In this application domain, units are spread and the distance between the sources of data and the decision makers may be very large. In the case of video streaming, the demand for high network throughput poses some extra requirements on the network. Considering the mobility patterns of the military units and the diversity of the new generations of sensors, especially those used by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), the configuration and the management of the network must be so dynamic and so sensitive to data flow parameters that manual configuration is not acceptable. For this reason, the capability of the network to configure itself to offer the necessary Quality of Service is a must.

An essential aspect of collaboration is trust and in order to establish it there is need for human-machine mutual understanding (HMMU). We argue that achieving HMMU will require evolving from an approach that reduces human factors as uncontrollable environmental elements, to one that repositions human emotions not only as a central part of an integrated control paradigm, but also as interpretable and steerable through appropriate information flows and mutual learning cycles. On the strategic decision-making side, we argue conflict resolution will require anticipating multiple trade-off situations that include human factors. On the operational level, symbiotic human-machine cognitive architectures should embed detected human emotions as inputs in shared machine control models. Trust measurements will play the role of mediating task coordination by pinpointing and dynamically composing appropriate situation-aware interaction protocols. In addition to a vision for HMMU, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary research strategy that attempts to unify the isolated efforts of different communities. The proposed vision is contextualized within a high-level research roadmap to support near and long-term activities in HMMU.","2379-1675","978-1-5090-6380-2","10.1109/COGSIMA.2017.7929606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929606","Human-Machine Interaction;Autonomous Systems;Situation-Awareness;Cognitive Agents;Trust;Shared Control","Collaboration;Hidden Markov models;Autonomous systems;Robots;Man-machine systems;Human factors;Computer architecture","decision making;groupware;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);software architecture","human-machine mutual understanding;trust establishment;human-machine interactions;collaborative-oriented use cases;HMMU;information flows;mutual learning cycles;strategic decision making;symbiotic human-machine cognitive architectures;situation-aware interaction protocols","","3","21","","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper reports the results of recent experiments aimed at investigating the potentials of TanDEM-X in characterizing quantitatively the spatial variability of the canopy top and phase center height, which is a proxy to horizontal structure.

Therefore, they were chosen two types of semiconductor switches. First is explained the operation of the inverter used, then the study of conduction and switching losses on the switches and diodes in antiparallel. The analysis of the conduction losses, is used for voltage at the nominal power curves module operation. Whereas the switching losses is used the energy dissipated curves during the ligament and the shutdown of the switches. These losses are displayed in simulation blocks, which are detailed building blocks implemented through a didactic approach.

In such cases, most subproblems can be solved independently by different processors. However, parallel processing is not suitable for some problems solved by nested Benders decomposition, due to the hierarchy between subproblems related to different time steps. In particular, for the deterministic case, parallel programming has been restricted to thread processing in lower-level machine computation and optimization solver codes. This paper proposes a new nested Benders decomposition strategy that is suitable for parallel processing, where time-coupled stages are solved simultaneously and an alternative procedure is employed to share initial conditions for the next stages as well as Benders cuts for the previous stages. The methodology is applied to the deterministic short term hydrothermal scheduling problem for the real large-scale Brazilian system, where the advantages of the proposed approach become more evident. In order to show the applicability of the method in low-budget and small parallel environments, the case study was processed with up to 24 process on multi-core computers.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2593402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516724","Parallel processing;multi stage Benders decomposition;short term hydrothermal scheduling","Power transmission lines;Reservoirs;Optimization;Planning;Power grids;Mathematical model;Parallel processing","hydrothermal power systems;mathematical programming;power generation scheduling","nested Benders decomposition strategy;parallel processing;hydrothermal scheduling problem;optimization strategies;mathematical-programming based decomposition strategies;two-stage Benders decomposition;parallel programming;large-scale Brazilian system","","10","20","","19 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the instant the aircraft Flight Data Recorder (FDR), or the ship Voyage Data Recorder (VDR), comes in contact with water, a locating device called ULB (Underwater Locator Beacon) starts a continuous emission of acoustic signals, or pings, for a minimum period of 30 days. After the crash of the Air France 447, in 2009, a discussion began about the effectiveness of the pingers in assisting in the location of “black boxes” and whether they should undergo some kind of modification to improve its capabilities. In order to understand the propagation of the pulses emitted by the ULBs in regions of past accidents, two fundamental aspects of the irradiated signal quality are analyzed: the components and specifications of pingers used in “black boxes” - as for example the acoustic intensity and the emitted waveform shape - and the physical characteristics of the medium and in what form it influences in the transmission of the pulses during its propagation by the ocean. This work has as main objective to contribute to the quantification of the detection capability of ULBs emitted pings in different scenarios /configurations and hopefully being able to clarify major issues regarding ULBs signal propagation assisting in the improvement of search and rescue (SAR) operational methodologies and in the development of “black box” acoustic signals detection instruments.","","978-1-5090-5010-9","10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2017.8349738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8349738","ULB;pinger;black box;FDR;VDR;SAR;Underwater acoustic propagation","Acoustics;Numerical models;Computational modeling;Aircraft;Oceans;Propagation losses;Absorption","aircraft;data recording;geophysical signal processing;marine accidents;oceanographic techniques;ships;underwater acoustic propagation","ULBs signal propagation;black box;acoustic signals detection instruments;Locator Beacon signal propagation;tropical waters;commercial aircraft;sea-crashes;maritime accidents;sunken vessels;Air France 447;acoustic intensity;AD 2009;signal quality;aircraft flight data recorder;ship voyage data recorder;underwater locator beacon;AD 2009","","","12","","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method can be split in two stages: the retrieval of the canonical scattering mechanisms present in an image cell and their parameterization. The association of the coherence matrix eigenvectors to the most dominant scattering mechanisms in the analyzed pixel introduces unfeasible regions in the H/α plane. This constraint can compromise the performance of detection, classification, and geophysical parameter inversion algorithms that are based on the investigation of this feature space. The independent component analysis (ICA), recently proposed as an alternative to eigenvector decomposition, provides promising new information to better interpret non-Gaussian heterogeneous clutter (inherent to highresolution SAR systems) in the frame of polarimetric ICTDs. Not constrained to any orthogonality between the estimated scattering mechanisms that compose the clutter under analysis, ICA does not introduce any unfeasible region in the H/α plane, increasing the range of possible natural phenomena depicted in the aforementioned feature space. This paper addresses the potential of the new information provided by the ICA as an ICTD method with respect to Cloude and Pottier H/α feature space. A PolSAR data set acquired in October 2006 by the E-SAR system over the upper part of the Tacul glacier from the Chamonix Mont Blanc test site, France, and a RAMSES X-band image acquired over Brétigny, France, are taken into consideration to investigate the characteristics of pixels that may fall outside the feasible regions in the H/α plane that arise when the eigenvector approach is employed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2735992","Brazilian Army; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048339","H/α feature space;independent component analysis (ICA);polarimetric incoherent target decomposition (ICTD)","Clutter;Entropy;Coherence;Algorithm design and analysis;Independent component analysis;Clustering algorithms","data analysis;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","unsupervised polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data classification;incoherent target decomposition;canonical scattering mechanisms;coherence matrix eigenvectors;dominant scattering mechanisms;unfeasible region;geophysical parameter inversion algorithms;independent component analysis;ICA;eigenvector decomposition;nonGaussian heterogeneous clutter;estimated scattering mechanisms;aforementioned feature space;ICTD method;PolSAR data analysis;Cloude and Pottier H-alpha feature space;H-alpha plane;polarimetric ICTD;H-alpha feature space provided","","4","58","","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its success comes from the abstract features learned by the deep architecture that are ultimately well separated in the feature space. The great amount of parameters to be learned requires the training data set to be very large, otherwise the risk of overfitting appears. Alternatively, one can resort to features selection in order to decrease the architecture's number of parameters to be learnt. For that purpose, this work proposes a simple feature selection method, based on single-layer neural networks, which select the most distinguishing features for each class. Then, the data will be classified by a deep neural network. The accuracy results for the testing data are higher for the lower dimensional data set when compared to the full data set, indicating less overfitting for the reduced data. Besides, a metric based on scatter matrices shows that the classes are better separated in the reduced feature space.","","978-1-78561-652-5","10.1049/cp.2017.0140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362080","Feature Selection;Deep Learning;Overfitting Problem;Hyperspectral Images","","feature selection;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;neural nets","feature selection;single-layer neural networks;hyperspectral image classification;deep learning technique;abstract feature learning;deep architecture;feature space;parameter learning;deep neural network;scatter matrices","","","","","24 May 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Because of the computational complexity and demanding interaction among agents, the high execution times and the volume of communication are open problems. To address these problems, we propose a Lightweight Coordination Multi-Agent Planning (LCMAP) approach that includes modules to compute unsolvability and independent plans detection, before the actual planning phase. The unsolvability detection is employed to avoid searching for planning tasks without solution, whereas the independent plans detection identifies goals that can be carried out independently by certain agents. The latter minimizes the interaction among agents, resulting in a low communication load and lightweight coordination during the actual planning phase. With the proposed modules, LCMAP can perform the coordination process and transform the MAP into multiple single-agent planning problems. The experimental results, initially focused on loosely coupled domains, show that LCMAP is up to 1.48× faster than the Distributed Cooperative Multi Agent Planning (FMAP) approach. Compared to the FMAP performance, LCMAP attained a reduction of up to 777× in the number of messages exchanged among agents during the planning process. In addition, using the benchmarks available at Unsolvability International Competition, LCMAP detected four instances as unsolvable problems. Therefore, the LCMAP unsolvability module proved its efficiency considering different number of actions and predicates.","","978-1-5386-2407-4","10.1109/BRACIS.2017.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247037","Multi-agent planning;multi-agent systems;automated planning","Planning;Complexity theory;Transforms;Privacy;Tools;Sensors","computational complexity;multi-agent systems;planning (artificial intelligence)","independent plans detection;actual planning phase;unsolvability detection;multiple single-agent planning problems;planning process;unsolvable problems;LCMAP unsolvability module;improving multiagent planning;independent plan detection;computational complexity;distributed cooperative multiagent planning approach;lightweight coordination multiagent planning approach","","","17","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The regulatory framework of different countries is then analyzed and compared with the theoretical definitions. Subsequently, different reactive power measurement methods are analyzed and their outputs are again compared with the definitions. Simulations performed with typical nonsinusoidal voltage and current signals show that several measurement techniques can easily be used for fundamental reactive power measurement, whereas the measurement of nonactive power requires more effort. Finally, a regulatory comparison of the pros and cons of each reactive power quantity is conducted. It is concluded that the surplus of reactive power in electricity grids should be controlled via fundamental reactive power (or displacement power factor), since it is independent of the harmonic distortion, the responsibility for it can be easily assigned, and it is easy to be measured with the use of several simple electronic measurement techniques.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2017.2673058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879815","Harmonic distortion;Q measurement;reactive power;wavelet transforms","Reactive power;Power measurement;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Harmonic analysis;Power system harmonics;Distortion measurement","harmonic distortion;power measurement;reactive power;wavelet transforms","reactive power billing;low-voltage systems;nonsinusoidal conditions;reactive power measurement;harmonic distortion;wavelet transforms","","4","28","","16 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the proposed method allows the decomposition of the total cost of transmission in two installments: the first, referring to the utilized capacity of the network (estimated at a predetermined operating point), and the second, to the transmission capacity still available in the system. A subsystem decomposition technique of the nodal tariffs also ensures the applicability of the method in interconnected markets. From the decomposition rates, it is possible to assess the responsibility of each participant on the cost of use of any specified set of transmission elements. The flexibility of the method enables an allocation via postage stamp costs (i.e., pro-rata), related to interconnection lines and/or high systemic importance circuits. After the presentation of the mathematical formulation, a procedure for the consideration of multiple operating points (dispatching scenarios) is proposed to evaluate nodal prices and also a new algorithm to determine zonal tariffs, i.e., applicable to all generators or loads at the zone.

A two-dimensional (2-D) parametric model using the Friis equation in a two-ray approximation is obtained. The model is applied to the problem of optimizing the reading time of the moving tag as a function of all system parameters. In particular, we consider the reading zone optimization as a function of all of a structure's position angles and relative distances. We find optimal positioning angles and apply a statistical model for predicting the reading failure probability as a function of electromagnetic parameters in addition to speed and reading rates. Measurements taken in an open environment over paved ground confirm the model predictions.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2017.2706650","Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7945526","","Antenna measurements;Radiofrequency identification;Radio frequency;Geometry;Couplings;Reflection;Electromagnetics","backscatter;optimisation;probability;radiofrequency identification","radiofrequency identification zones;high-speed tag reading probability;backscattered signal reading zone;radiation features;Friis equation;reading zone optimization;reading failure probability;electromagnetic parameters","","","57","","9 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Use of AUV with side scan sonar embedded to testify targets in anchoring areas","V. B. Pimentel; C. Florentino; G. A. G. Nascimento; R. C.

This is feasible due to the efforts on the improvement methods and technologies geared to the hydrographic surveys practices and nautical cartographic sciences. In this sense, there is an increasing number of researches exploring the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in ocean mapping activities. This equipment, with sensors such as Side Scan Sonar (SSS) embedded, is capable to carry out the imaging, ensonification, dimensioning and acquirement of oceanographic data in an autonomous and simultaneous way, through predetermined AUV parameters. Its application allows the data collection on areas with hard access characteristics, which caters a higher security conditions for the survey vessels, but still preserves the information quality. Moreover, the SSS associated to the AUV enables a closer scanning of the seabed. This sensor generates a better representation of the underwater features as well as a high accuracy on angular and distance disambiguation. This sort of operation aims to correlate objects detected on the seafloor to current information on nautical charts. Thus, it would be possible to testify the existence of a target previously reported. In this sense, concerning about the navigation safety, stands out the acknowledge of the submarine ground in anchoring areas. Therefore, the present fieldwork had as object of research the anchoring area number 2, a section reserved for warships, located inside the Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro-RJ), next to the Brazilian Navy Graduating School (Villegagnon Island). On that zone, an investigation was conducted in order to verify the presence of submarine features pointed by Notice to Mariners to the Nautical Charts 1511 (4th ed., 2000) and 1512 (4th ed., 2000) and reported in the Bathymetric Database of the CHM (Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center). The AUV system used was the Remus 100S, equipped with an interferometric side scan sonar, operating at a frequency of 100-500 KHz and an MSTL Side Scan Sonar, at a frequency of 900 KHz. The reference data, extracted from the Bathymetric Database of the CHM, were acquired by an EM3000 multibeam echosounder during a hydrographic survey carried out in 2014. Two another points of interest were also included on this research. On those spots, Brazilian warships reported potential navigation hazards while anchored in 2003 and 2005. It is worth mentioning, however, that these additional objects have never been detected in previous hydrographic surveys. At the end of this research, a joint analysis of the reference bathymetric data and the side scan sonar images obtained by AUV confirmed the presence of the objects loaded in the Bathymetric Database and those informed in Nautical Charts 1511 and 1512. This study provides a pathway for future uses of side scan sonar attached to AUV platforms in order to investigate cartographic representation of targets not identified by other methods.","","978-1-5090-5010-9","10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2017.8349707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8349707","AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle);side scan sonar;submerged target;hydrographic research;nautical charts","Sonar navigation;Sonar;Sensors;Acoustics;Safety;Marine vehicles;Underwater autonomous vehicles","bathymetry;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;seafloor phenomena;sonar;underwater sound;underwater vehicles","Rio de Janeiro;Guanabara Bay;Villegagnon Island;data collection;predetermined AUV parameters;oceanographic data;ocean mapping activities;nautical cartographic sciences;hydrographic surveys practices;national nautical documents;hydrographie information;AUV platforms;side scan sonar images;hydrographic survey;MSTL Side Scan Sonar;interferometric side scan sonar;AUV system;Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center;Bathymetric Database;Nautical Charts 1511;submarine features;Brazilian Navy Graduating School;anchoring area number;angular distance disambiguation;underwater features;information quality;survey vessels","","1","15","","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
