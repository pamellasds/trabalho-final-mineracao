Current approaches to the clustering of sparse gene expression data with temporal information suffer from their at least quadratic complexity in the number of clusters, the number of genes, or both, and are not distributed. In this paper, we present the first distributed and density-based approach to short time series clustering, called DTSCluster, which is suitable for gene expression data. DTSCluster identifies dense patterns in the distributed datasets and uses them to generate the time series clusters. The comparative experimental results revealed that DTSCluster is scalable in the dataset size with linear complexity in time and space, and outperforms other representative approaches in terms of cluster validation with the silhouette index as well. The distributed scenario also opens up the opportunity for collaborative data mining between different gene expression data holders. © 2017 IEEE.","distributed data clustering; short time series; Time series clustering","Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Learning systems; Time series; Collaborative data minings; Density-based approaches; Distributed data; Gene Expression Data; Gene expression data analysis; Short time series; Temporal information; Time series clustering; Gene expression",,"Palade V.Chen X.Luo F.Wani M.A.Luo B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538614174,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this context, the GISSA framework, an intelligent governance framework for Brazilian health system, emerges as a smart system for the Federal Government program, called Stork Network. Its main objective is to improve the healthcare for pregnant women as well as their newborns. This application aims to generate alerts focusing on the health status verification of newborns and pregnant woman to support decision-makers in preventive actions that may mitigate severe problems. Therefore, this paper presents the LAIS, an Intelligent health analysis system that uses data mining (DM) to generate newborns death risk alerts through probability-based methods. Results show that the Naïve Bayes classifier presents better performance than the other DM approaches to the used pregnancy data set analysis of this work.

Considering scenarios with a multitude of virtual environments hosting educational activities, accessible through a common infrastructure, we devised a reference model where data generated from interaction between users and among users and the environment itself, are selected, organized and stored in local ""baskets"". Local baskets are then collected and grouped in a global basket. Organization resources like item modeling are used in both levels of basket construction. Using this reference upon a client-server architectural style, a reference architecture was developed and has been used to carry out a project for an official foundation linked to Brazilian Ministry of Education, involving educational data mining and sharing of 100+ higher education institutions and their respective virtual environments. In this architecture, a client-collector inside each virtual environment collects information from database and event logs. This information along with definitions obtained from item models are used to build local baskets. A synchronization protocol keeps all item models synced with client-collectors and server-collectors generating global baskets. This approach has shown improvements on ETL like: parallel processing of items, economy on storage space and bandwidth, privacy assurance, better tenacity, and good scalability. © 2017 IEEE.","Distance education; Educational data mining; Learning analytics","Architecture; Digital storage; Distance education; Linked data; Virtual reality; Common infrastructures; Educational activities; Educational data mining; Higher education institutions; Learning analytics; Ministry of Education; Reference architecture; Synchronization protocols; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781509059195,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

Paulista, SP, Brazil","AIMS: The many miRNAs discovered so far have been divided into biologically representative families, aiming at organizing and systematizing their study so to promote, mainly, a better understanding of their functionalities. Clustering miRNA sequences can corroborate the family-based organizations as well as helping to explore sequences belonging to the same cluster as potentially having similar biological functions.OBSERVATIONS: Considering that members of the same miRNA family tend to biologically function in similar ways, a well-structured family can help detecting miRNA functions which have not been associated yet with any existing family.METHODS: The work described in this paper empirically investigates the suitability of organizing miRNAs as families, using a clustering algorithm based on a particular type of graph i.e., minimal spanning tree (MST), for clustering miRNA sequences. Seven miRNA families stored in the online miRBase database have been used as input to the MST-based clustering algorithm and clustering results have been compared to assess the suitability of identirying them.RESULTS: The motivations for the experiments were to identify refinements in miRNA family organizations that could be pursued and, also, investigate how the chosen graph-based clustering algorithm would perform in miRNA related domains.CONCLUSION: Interesting and useful results, particularly related to detecting information based on the visualization of the final induced graphs, and their induced connected components (clusters), are presented and discussed. Particularly, experiments results suggested the possibility of refining some miRNA families by grouping some of their miRNAs as sub-families.

Recently, some studies have been showing new ways of obtaining data through location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare, which could revolutionize the study of urban social behavior. We use Foursquare check-ins to represent user preferences regarding eating and drinking habits. Considering datasets differing in terms of volume of data and observation window size, our results indicate that spatio-temporal eating and drinking habits of users voluntarily expressed in LBSNs has the potential to explain cultural habits of the users. From this, we propose a methodology to identify cultural boundaries and similarities across populations at different scales, e.g., countries, cities, or neighborhoods. This methodology is extensively evaluated in several aspects. For instance, by proposing some variations of it disregarding some of the considered dimensions, as well as analyzing the results using datasets from different periods and window of observation. The results indicate that our proposed methodology is a promising approach for automatic cultural habits separation, which could enable new urban services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-cultural study; Foursquare; Large scale assessment; Location-based social network; Urban data mining","Hardware; Information systems; Cross-cultural study; Cultural boundaries; Cultural difference; Foursquare; Large scale assessment; Large-scale studies; Location-based social networks; Observation window; Data mining","Silva, T.H.; Department of Informatics, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do ParanáBrazil; email: thiagoh@utfpr.edu.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064379,,INSYD,,"English","Inf.

As a consequence of the growth of data volume, there is an increasing need to obtain knowledge from these large datasets that are very difficult to handle and process with traditional methods. Software agents can play a significant role performing data mining processes in ways that are more efficient. For instance, they can work to perform selection, extraction, preprocessing, and integration of data as well as parallel, distributed, or multisource mining.

The goal of the current study is to recognize non-obvious patterns in a mass of data for road freights of selected grain: soy and corn. As such, the data mining technique, known as the Apriori algorithm, is used to generate association rules that describe such patterns. Among the varied rules identified by this technique, we highlight those that enable us to conclude that: i. Soy and corn production in the state of Mato Grosso is carried via the port of Santos; ii. The grain storage silos located in the state of Mato Grosso mainly receive shipments from the same state; iii. The port of Sao Francisco do Sul, mainly receives corn; iv. In the state of Minas Gerais there is an intermodal route that receives the grain originating mostly from Mato Grosso and transfers it to the rail system, which then carries the load to its next destination. © 2017, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

The techniques for comparing conferences use familiar similarity measures and a new measure based on co-authorship communities, called co-authorship network community similarity index. The experiments reported in the article indicate that the technique based on the new measure performs better than the other techniques for comparing conferences, which is therefore the first contribution of the article. Then, the article focuses on three families of techniques for conference recommendation. The first family adopts collaborative filtering based on the conference similarity measures investigated in the first part of the article. The second family includes two techniques based on the idea of finding, for a given author, the strongest related authors in the co-authorship network and recommending the conferences that his co-authors usually publish in. The first member of this family is based on the Weighted Semantic Connectivity Score—WSCS, which is accurate but quite costly to compute for large co-authorship networks. The second member of this family is based on a new score, called the Modified Weighted Semantic Connectivity Score—MWSCS, which is much faster to compute and as accurate as the WSCS. The third family includes the Cluster-WSCS-based and the Cluster-MWSCS-based conference recommendation techniques, which adopt conference clusters generated using a subgraph of the co-authorship network. The experiments indicate as the best performing conference recommendation technique the Cluster-WSCS-based technique. This is the second contribution of the article. Finally, the article includes experiments that use data extracted from the DBLP repository and a web-based application that enables users to interactively analyze and compare a set of conferences. © 2017, The Author(s).","Co-authorship networks; Conference comparison; Conference recommendation; Linked data; Recommender systems; Social network analysis","Collaborative filtering; Recommender systems; Semantics; Social networking (online); Co-authorship networks; Co-authorships; Conference comparison; Conference recommendation; Linked datum; Recommendation techniques; Similarity measure; Web-based applications; Data mining","Casanova, M.A.; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: casanova@inf.puc-rio.br",,"Springer London",01046500,,,,"English","J.

Beyond the traditional recommender strategies, there is a growing effort to incorporate users’ reviews into the recommendation process, since they provide a rich set of information regarding both items’ features and users’ preferences. This article proposes a recommender system that uses users’ reviews to produce items’ representations that are based on the overall sentiment toward the items’ features. We focus on exploiting the impact that different feature extraction techniques, allied with sentiment analysis, cause in an item attribute-aware neighborhood-based recommender algorithm. We compare four techniques of different granularities (terms and aspects) in two recommendation scenarios (rating prediction and item recommendation) and elect the most promising technique. We also compare our techniques with traditional structured metadata constructions, which are used as the baseline in our experimental evaluation. The results show that the techniques based on terms provide better results, since they produce a larger set of features, hence detailing better the items. © 2017, The Author(s).","Feature extraction; Item representation; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis","Data mining; Extraction; Recommender systems; Different granularities; Experimental evaluation; Feature extraction techniques; Information overloads; Item representation; Personalized content; Recommender algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Feature extraction","D’Addio, R.M.; Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, Sao Paulo UniversityBrazil; email: rdaddio@icmc.usp.br",,"Springer London",01046500,,,,"English","J.

With the sophistication of vehicle instrumentation, reckless maneuvers, such as abrupt turns, acceleration, and deceleration, can now be accurately detected by analyzing data related to the driver-vehicle interactions. Such analysis usually requires very specific in-vehicle hardware and infrastructure sensors (e.g. loop detectors and radars), which can be costly. Hence, in this paper, we investigated if off-the-shelf smartphones can be used to online detect and classify the driver’s behavior in near real-time. To do so, we first modeled and performed an intrinsic evaluation to assess the performance of three outlier detection algorithms formulated as a data stream processing network which receives as input and processes data streams of smartphone and vehicle sensors. Next, we implemented a novel scoring mechanism based on online outlier detection to quantitatively evaluate drivers’ maneuvers as either cautious or reckless. Thus, we adapted a data mining mechanism which takes into account a sensor’s data rates and power to determine driver behavior in the scoring process. Finally, as the intrinsic evaluation does not necessarily reveal how well an algorithm will perform in a real-world scenario, we evaluated the algorithm that achieved the best result in a real-world case study to assess drivers’ driving behavior. Our results indicate that the algorithm performs quickly and accurately; the algorithm classifies driver behavior with 95.45% accuracy. Moreover, such results are obtained within 100 milliseconds of processing time on average. © 2017, The Author(s).","In-Vehicle sensing; Online driving behavior detection; Online outlier detection; Smartphone","Accidents; Data communication systems; Data handling; Data mining; Smartphones; Statistics; Vehicles; Complex event processing; Data stream processing; Driving behavior; Outlier Detection; Outlier detection algorithm; Real-world scenario; Reckless driving; Vehicle interactions; Behavioral research","Vasconcelos, I.; Department of Informatics, University Tiradentes (UNIT)Brazil; email: ivasconcelos@inf.puc-rio.br",,"Springer London",18674828,,,,"English","J.

Treatments that can ameliorate UVB-induced skin damage include natural extracts, which can act as skin photochemoprotective agents. Byrsonima crassifolia is widely used in the folk medicine. Previously studies have shown high antioxidant activity of BC leaves extracts. In this study we described the first photochemoprotective potential of Byrsonima crassifolia extract (BCP) and fraction (BCF) against UVB-induced damage in keratinocytes and the ability of topical formulations with BCP or BCF to increase the antioxidant activity in pig ear skin. The results of characterization of BCP and BCF indicate that the phenolic content was increased two-fold after an enrichment process for obtaining BCF. Despite differences in the phenolic content, both BCP and BCF exhibited similar IC50 values for lipid peroxidation and the DPPH[rad] method during the antioxidant activity study. However, for the chemiluminescence assay using the xanthine/luminol/XOD, BCF exhibited higher antioxidant activity than BCP. The different phenolic content in BCP and BCF did not influence their photochemoprotective activity in HaCaT cells, and both samples exhibited similar levels of protection. After treatment with BCP and BCF (1.2–5 μg/mL) and UVB irradiation exposure, the effect of lipid peroxidation in vitro was maintained in cell culture, and both IL-6 and TNF-α secretion and NF-κB activation were suppressed. After the development of the different formulations, BCP and BCF increased the antioxidant activity on skin and the formulation containing BCF showed higher skin retention, especially for (+) catechin, which was able to pass through the stratum corneum. Based on these findings, BCF could be topically applied to prevent/treat the damage induced by UVB radiation in the skin. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Catechin; Cytokine; Cytotoxicity; Franz cell; Photochemoprotection; Topical formulation","Antioxidants; Cell culture; Chemiluminescence; Cytotoxicity; Dermatology; Flavonoids; Irradiation; Lipids; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; Phenols; Catechin; Cytokines; Franz cell; Photochemoprotection; Topical formulations; Data mining; antioxidant; carcinogen; cells and cell components; induced response; irradiation; lesion; phenolic compound; photochemistry; pig; plant extract; shrub; skin; ultraviolet B radiation; Byrsonima crassifolia; Suidae","de Souza, R.O.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Av. do Café s/n, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil; email: reoliveiradesouza@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09266690,,ICRDE,,"English","Ind.

The objective of this research is to discover useful knowledge amidst water monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2011, in a specific region of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The research was performed in three steps: discovery of classification rules of ecotoxicity in water samples using predictive modelling; investigation of the presence of strong relationships between water quality parameters by associative analysis; and discovery of sampling sites, which are similar with respect to their quality parameters, by applying a clustering method. The knowledge discovery process employed in this work was divided into four phases: selection of study area and data, pre-processing of the selected data, mining of the pre-processed data, and interpretation and evaluation of the results. The data mining step was supported by different algorithms, each one focused on a particular issue of the research: sequential coverage algorithm for classification of ecotoxicity; Apriori algorithm for identifying associations between quality parameters, and Prim’s algorithm and pruning algorithm for clustering of water sampling sites. We observed the association of certain quality parameters to water ecotoxicity, the existence of correlations between some of the quality parameters, and the presence of homogeneous groups amidst the sampling sites. These results may provide valuable input to the field of water quality monitoring, from the technical activities, such as the laboratorial analysis of water samples, to the decision makers responsible for defining the future public policies for water resources management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Associative analysis; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Environmental management systems; Knowledge discovery in databases; Predictive modeling; Water resources management","Cluster analysis; Data handling; Data mining; Decision making; Environmental management; Environmental management systems; Information management; Quality control; Water quality; Water resources; Associative analysis; Computational resources; Knowledge discovery in database; Knowledge discovery process; Predictive modeling; Water quality monitoring; Water quality parameters; Water resources management; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; cluster analysis; data mining; database; ecotoxicology; environmental management; environmental modeling; environmental monitoring; environmental research; resource management; social policy; water quality; water resource; Brazil","Bertholdo, L.; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of São PauloBrazil; email: l.bertholdo@ifsp.edu.br",,"Springer Basel",21987491,,,,"English","Environ.

The application of software engineering for Big Data is recent and emerging, so in the literature we find a number of challenges and opportunities related to Big Data, but few practical approaches. Objective In this paper, we propose a practical approach based on MDE (Model Driven Engineering) to support the semi-automated development of software systems for Big Data platform that use MapReduce model. Method The proposed approach consists of framework, process, metamodels, visual Alf, transformation definitions written in ATL and Eclipse IDE plug-in. The proposed framework uses concepts of MDE, Weaving and software development based on Y. Our proposed process guides the use of our approach. A graphical notation and extended metamodel for Alf (i.e. visual Alf) assign executable behavior for UML or DSLs. An Eclipse IDE plug-in implements our approach. Results We show the applicability of the proposed approach through an illustrative example. Conclusion Our approach brings a contribution because the development of software systems is assisted by models which preserves the business logic and adds Big Data features throughout the development process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big Data; Framework; Metamodels; Model Driven Engineering","Application programs; Computer software; Data mining; Digital storage; Integrodifferential equations; Java programming language; Software design; Software engineering; Development process; Extracting information; Framework; Graphical notation; MapReduce models; Meta model; Model-driven Engineering; Software systems; Big data","Lopes, D.; Federal University of Maranhão - UFMABrazil; email: denivaldo.lopes@ufma.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025631316

Many works report on the use of data mining techniques to predict the future direction of stock prices and to discover patterns in the time series data to provide decision support for trading operations. Traditional optimization methods do not take into account the possibility that the function to be optimized, namely, the final financial balance for operations considering some stock, may have multiple peaks, i.e., be represented by multimodal functions. However, multimodality is a known feature of real-world financial time series optimization problems. To deal with this issue, this article proposes the PAA-MS-IDPSO-V approach (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation - Multi-Swarm of Improved Self-adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization with Validation). The proposed method aims to find patterns in financial time series to support investment decisions. The approach uses multi-swarms to obtain a better particle initialization for the final optimization phase since it aims to tackle multimodal problems. Furthermore, it uses a validation set with early stopping to avoid overfitting. The patterns discovered by the method are used together with investment rules to support decisions and thus help investors to maximize the profit in their operations in the stock market. The experiments reported in this paper compare the results obtained by the proposed model with the Buy-and-Hold, PAA-IDPSO approaches and another approach found in the literature. We report on experiments conducted with S&P100 index stocks and using the Friedman Non-Parametric Test with the Nemenyi post-hoc Test both with 95% confidence level. The results show that the proposed model outperformed the competing methods and was able to considerably reduce the variance for all stocks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Multi-swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Pattern discovery; Stock market; Time series representation","Aggregates; Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Finance; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series; Adaptive particle swarm optimizations; Financial time series; Investment decisions; Multi modal function; Multi-swarms; Optimization problems; Pattern discovery; Piecewise aggregate approximation; Electronic trading","Oliveira, A.L.I.; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Centro de Informática, Av.

With the increasing use of smartphones to access social media platforms, a new wave of applications that explore sentiment analysis in the mobile environment is beginning to emerge. However, there are various existing sentiment analysis methods and it is unclear which of them are deployable in the mobile environment. In this paper, we provide the first of a kind study in which we compare the performance of 14 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods in the mobile environment. To do that, we adapted these methods to run on Android OS and then, we measure their performance in terms of memory, CPU, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory. We hope our effort provides a guide to developers and researchers interested in exploring sentiment analysis as part of a mobile application and can help new applications to be executed without the dependency of a server-side API. We also share the Android API that implements all the 14 sentiment analysis methods used in this paper. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Android; Mobile; Performance evaluation; Sentiment analysis","Application programming interfaces (API); Data mining; Mobile devices; Online systems; Social networking (online); Android; Battery consumption; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile environments; Performance evaluation; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Android (operating system)","Messias, J.; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG)Brazil; email: johnnatan@dcc.ufmg.br",,"Springer-Verlag Wien",18695450,,,,"English","Soc.

In this context, nanotechnology may be alternatively used to provide an additional protection for these compounds, avoiding degradative reactions. Different formulation parameters (eg. particle size, zeta potential, internal phase fraction) were assayed to maximize a local antioxidant action. Firstly, the extraction procedure for obtaining increased concentrations of antioxidant compounds was optimized. High stirring speed and ethanol as extractor liquid were defined as key parameters. Nanoparticles were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Polycaprolactone-based nanoparticles showed to be more stable than poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based nanoparticles. Instead of poly(vinyl alcohol), Pluronic® was selected as surfactant because it avoids aggregate formation and provides smaller particle size. While higher polymer content contributes positively to maintaining both reduced size particle and distribution, an increased extract concentration impacted negatively on these parameters. Stability studies were also performed using skin extracts and homogenates and confirmed that nanostructures provide an additional protection. Moreover, the incorporation of Ilex extract in nanoparticles significantly reduced the amount of chlorogenic acid permeated through the skin (no ex vivo permeation until 12 h for this system), extending its topical antioxidant effect. © 2017","Chemical stability; Ilex paraguariensis; Polymer nanoparticles; Topical delivery","Antioxidants; Chemical compounds; Chemical stability; Emulsification; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Particle size; Polymers; Polyvinyl alcohols; Anti-oxidant activities; Antioxidant compounds; Double emulsion-solvent evaporation; Ilex paraguariensis; Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid; Polymer nanoparticles; Polymeric nanoparticles; Topical delivery; Data mining; antioxidant; ethanol; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; particle size; plant extract; polymer; shrub; solvent; surfactant; Ilex; Ilex paraguariensis","de Campos, A.M.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Farmácia (PGFAR), Departamento de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Universitário, TrindadeBrazil; email: angela.campos@ufsc.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09266690,,ICRDE,,"English","Ind.

Its results were based on 1693 studies, selected among 3984 studies identified in five digital libraries. The produced mapping gives a general summary of the subject, points some areas that lacks the development of primary or secondary studies, and can be a guide for researchers working with semantics-concerned text mining.

The goal of this Practical Experience Report is to evaluate the accuracy and per-formance impact of data anonymization on data mining classifiers results. This is done through comparisons of their execution using original and anonymized data. A sample of real data generated by a Brazilian city transportation system associated to fictitious users was anonymized at different stages and classification algorithms, such as ZeroR, KNN (k - Nearest Neighbor), and Naive Bayes, were applied. Contrary to expectations, when the anonymization techniques were introduced in some classes, the accuracy was raised, as well as performance, reducing execution time. These results demonstrate that data anonymization techniques, when properly applied, can contribute to the effectiveness of data mining classifiers. © 2017 IEEE.","Anonymization; Classification; Data Mining; Data utility; Privacy","Barium compounds; Classification (of information); Data privacy; Nearest neighbor search; Anonymization; Classification algorithm; Data anonymization; Data mining process; Data utilities; K-nearest neighbors; Practical experience; Transportation system; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538606025,,,"English","Proc. - Eur.

Test Zone Search (TZS) is the state-of-the-art fast ME algorithm, currently deployed in the reference HEVC encoder due to its great coding efficiency. However, ME is still one of the main sources of complexity in HEVC. This paper proposes an early-termination scheme for TZS, called e-TZS, based on an extensive data mining process on ME attributes. The data mining process allowed identifying the most relevant information during the encoding process to build a set of decision tree models that terminate TZS in different steps of its execution. The e-TZS scheme was implemented in the HEVC reference software and achieved average decision precision of 94.2%. Experimental results showed an average complexity reduction of 62.53% in TZS, with a negligible BD-rate increase of only 0.49%, in comparison to the original algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Data mining; Decision trees; Early termination; Motion estimation; Test zone search","Decision trees; Efficiency; Image coding; Image compression; Motion estimation; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Multimedia signal processing; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Trees (mathematics); Video signal processing; Complexity reduction; Decision tree models; Early termination; Early termination schemes; Fast motion estimation; High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC); Test zone; Video compression standards; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509036493,,,"English","IEEE Int.

An extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method is presented, including an analysis of the performance of predictive models built using the selected subsets of features. The results show the competitiveness of the method in comparison with six feature selection algorithms. As an additional contribution, we conducted a pioneer, rigorous, and replicable systematic review on related work. As a result, a summary of 93 related papers strengthens features of our method. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"Combinatorial optimization; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Combinatorial optimization problems; Experimental evaluation; Feature selection algorithm; Importance measure; Important features; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Pareto multi-objective genetic algorithms; Simultaneous optimization; Feature extraction","Spolaôr, N.; Laboratory of Bioinformatics (LABI), Western Paraná State University (UNIOESTE), Presidente Tancredo Neves Avenue, 6731, Brazil; email: newtonspolaor@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",08839514,,AAINE,,"English","Appl Artif Intell",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042911854

For this reason, it is necessary to obtain mathematical and computational tools that enable power systems engineers to make decisions that reduce harmonic distortions in accordance with international standards. This paper presents a total harmonic distortion (THD) assessment based on full knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) using power quality (PQ) standards and computational intelligence tools. The materials and methods of THD assessment consist of load and layout analysis; choice and installation of PQ analyzers; and the application of the full KDD process, including collection, selection, cleaning, integration, transformation and reduction, mining, interpretation, and evaluation of the data. This research methodology was used in an electrical and electronic industry; the results obtained have characteristics that can be used as a reference for other types of analyses. The results indicate that these methods can be applied to several industrial applications such as: 1) the description of the complete KDD process for THD assessment of the point of common coupling; 2) simultaneous collection using five PQ analyzers at several points in the electrical network; and (3) the use of a decision tree classifier. © 2013 IEEE.","computational intelligence; data mining; decision tree; Harmonic distortion; KDD; power quality","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Electric fault currents; Electric network analysis; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic distortion; Metadata; Power quality; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree classifiers; Electronic industries; Industrial production; International standards; Knowledge discovery in database; Point of common coupling; Research methodologies; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Data mining","De Oliveira, E.F.; Post-Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Para-UFPABrazil; email: edsonfarias2007@hotmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035755903

Processing, exploring and visualizing the inconceivable volumes of such images has turned out to be progressively troublesome. The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains an important issue that finds potential applications, given the place that retrieving digital images similar to a user-defined specification or pattern in huge databases now occupies in the day-to-day. CBIR systems use visual information like color, shape and texture to represent images in feature vectors. In general, there is an inconsistency in the evaluation of similarity between images according to human perception and the results computed by CBIR systems, which is called Semantic Gap. One way to improve CBIR systems is by the addition of techniques to visualize and interact with CBIR regarding similarity and diversity criteria, where the user can participate more actively in the process and steer the results according to its needs. In this paper we present the Visual-Interactive k-NDN Method (ViK): a novel approach to visualize and interact with Content-Based Image Retrieval systems. This paper aims at making use of Visual Data Mining techniques applied to queries in CBIR systems, improving the interpretability of the measure of diversity, applied using fractal analysis, as well as the relevance of results according to the prior knowledge of the user. Therefore, the user takes an active role in the content-based image retrieval, guiding its result and, consequently, reducing the Semantic Gap. Additionally, a better understanding of the diversity and similarity factors involved in the query is supported by visualization and interaction techniques. © 2017 IEEE.","Content-based image retrieval; Diversity; Visual data mining","Content based retrieval; Data mining; Information retrieval; Medical imaging; Search engines; Semantics; Visualization; Weather forecasting; Content based image retrieval; Content based image retrieval systems; Diversity; Interaction techniques; Shape and textures; Similarity factors; Visual data mining; Visual information; Image retrieval",,"Ivanova M.Temperini M.McK.

In this context, the classification of chart images becomes important because it allows various types of graphs to be detected automatically in different contexts, allowing a more specific processing for each type of visualization, for example, data extraction. Several techniques of image classification can be used, where the most common are based on the extraction of features of the images, and a later classification using these features. However, one technique that has been gaining prominence in the context of image classification is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This technique is based on deep learning and, in a way, encapsulates the feature extraction process. In this way, the proposal of this article is to use an architecture of a client-server based model to do the chart image classification and later data extraction from this image. The main advantage is doing the CNN processing on the server side, so the application does not rely on client device limitations. For this, an image dataset was generated from the web, and it has ten classes of graphs. From the experiments done, it was seen that the use of this technique was feasible, and modifications in the architecture can be made as a proposal to improve the accuracy of the model. © 2017 IEEE.","Chart image classification; Convolutional neural network; Data extraction","Classification (of information); Convolution; Data mining; Data visualization; Extraction; Image classification; Information systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Visualization; Client devices; Client server; Computational system; Convolutional neural network; Data extraction; Image datasets; Information visualization; Server sides; Image processing",,"Ivanova M.Temperini M.McK.

This language embeds a number of ontological patterns that reflect the micro-theories comprising a particular foundational ontology named UFO. We here (re)define OntoUML as a formal graph grammar and demonstrate how the models of this language can be constructed by the combined application of ontological patterns following a number of graph transformation rules. As a result, we obtain a version of this language fully defined as a formal Ontology Pattern Grammar. In other words, this paper presents a formal definition of OntoUML that is both explicit in terms of the ontological patterns that it incorporates and is completely independent of the UML meta-model. © 2017 PTI.",,"Context sensitive grammars; Data mining; Formal languages; Graph theory; Information systems; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Conceptual modeling languages; Formal definition; Formal ontology; Foundational ontologies; Graph grammar; Graph transformation rules; Meta model; Ontology patterns; Modeling languages",,"Ganzha M.Maciaszek L.Paprzycki M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9788394625375,,,"English","Proc.

An analysis of these data streams can supply valuable insights to improve the monitoring of the patients. The volume, frequency and complexity of data, which come unlabeled, make their analysis a challenging task. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been successfully employed for mining data streams to extract useful knowledge for health care monitoring. It includes the detection of changes in the behavior of sensors, failures on machines or systems, and data anomalies. Anomaly (or outlier) detection is a ML task that aims to find exceptions or abnormalities in a dataset. These exceptions, in a medical context, can represent a new disease pattern, an event to be further investigated, behavior changes or potential health complications. Despite of its analysis in data streams is a challenging task, temporal abstractions techniques should help due to they deal with the management and abstraction of time based data, offering high level of visualization of each data object in its context.

The amount of information generated in this environment has led to an unprecedented increase in data collection. One of the major challenges for its development lies in the storage and the processing of this huge volume of data into acceptable measurements and analysis parameters. This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO). © 2017 IEEE","Hadoop Architecture; Internet of Things; Sensor Data Mining; Smart Cities","Batch data processing; Carbon monoxide; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data mining; Data visualization; Digital storage; Information use; Internet of things; Smart city; Transmission control protocol; Amount of information; Carbon monoxide sensor; Exploratory analysis; International standards; Internet of Things (IOT); Sensor-data mining; Transmission control protocol/internet protocols; World Health Organization; Big data",,"Khan L.Palanisamy B.Zhang C.Sarvestani S.S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538615621,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The method predicts the epitope activity ϵq(cqj) of one query peptide (q-peptide) under a set of experimental query conditions (cqj). The method uses as input the sequence of the q-peptide. The method also uses as input information about the sequence and epitope activity ϵr(crj) of a peptide of reference (r-peptide) assayed under similar experimental conditions (crj). The model proposed here is able to classify 1raquo;048raquo;190 pairs of query and reference peptide sequences from the proteome of many organisms reported on IEDB database. These pairs have variations (perturbations) under sequence or assay conditions. The model has accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between 71 and 80% for training and external validation series. The retrieved information contains structural changes in 83raquo;683 peptides sequences (Seq) determined in experimental assays with boundary conditions involving 1448 epitope organisms (Org), 323 host organisms (Host), 15 types of in vivo process (Proc), 28 experimental techniques (Tech), and 505 adjuvant additives (Adj). Afterward, we reported the experimental sampling, isolation, and sequencing of 15 complete sequences of Bm86 gene from state of Colima, Mexico. Last, we used the model to predict the epitope immunogenic scores under different experimental conditions for the 26raquo;112 peptides obtained from these sequences. The model may become a useful tool for epitope selection toward vaccine design.

Ionospheric scintillation is a rapid variation in the amplitude and/or phase of radio signals traveling through the ionosphere. This spatial and time-varying phenomenon is of great interest since it affects the reception quality of satellite signals. Specialized receivers at strategic regions can track multiple variables related to this phenomenon, generating a database of observations of regional ionospheric scintillation. We introduce a visual analytics solution to support analysis of such data, keeping in mind the general applicability of our approach to similar multivariate data analysis situations. Taking into account typical user questions, we combine visualization and data mining algorithms that satisfy these goals: (i) derive a representation of the variables monitored that conveys their behavior in detail, at multiple user-defined aggregation levels; (ii) provide overviews of multiple variables regarding their behavioral similarity over selected time periods; (iii) support users when identifying representative variables for characterizing scintillation behavior. We illustrate the capabilities of our proposed framework by presenting case studies driven directly by questions formulated by collaborating domain experts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data visualization; Ionospheric scintillation; Time-varying multivariate data; Visual analytics; Visual feature selection","Data handling; Data mining; Ionosphere; Ionospheric measurement; Multivariant analysis; Scintillation; Visualization; Behavioral similarities; Data mining algorithm; Interactive approach; Ionospheric scintillation; Multivariate data; Multivariate data analysis; Satellite signals; Visual analytics; Data visualization","Soriano-Vargas, A.; Instituto de Ciências Matemticas e de Computação (ICMC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos, SP, 13566-590, Brazil; email: asoriano@icmc.usp.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",00978493,,COGRD,,"English","Comput Graphics (Pergamon)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028943956

The industries are not always interested in the most accurate technique for a given problem, but most appropriate for the expected results, there must be a balance between accuracy and computational cost. This paper investigates the classification of the quality of wood boards based on their images. For such, it compares the use of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks, with the combination of texture-based feature extraction techniques and traditional techniques: Decision tree induction algorithms, Neural Networks, Nearest neighbors and Support vector machines. Reported studies show that Deep Learning techniques applied to image processing tasks have achieved predictive performance superior to traditional classification techniques, mainly in high complex scenarios. One of the reasons pointed out is their embedded feature extraction mechanism. Deep Learning techniques directly identify and extract features, considered by them to be relevant, in a given image dataset. However, empirical results for the image data set have shown that the texture descriptor method proposed, regardless of the strategy employed is very competitive when compared with Convolutional Neural Network for all the performed experiments. The best performance of the texture descriptor method could be caused by the nature of the image dataset. Finally are pointed out some perspectives of futures developments with the application of Active learning and Semi supervised methods. © 2017","Deep learning; Image classification; Machine learning; Wood classification","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image texture; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Classification technique; Convolutional neural network; Decision tree induction; Extraction mechanisms; Feature extraction techniques; Predictive performance; Semi-supervised method; Traditional techniques; Image classification","Affonso, C.; UNESP - Universidade Estadual Paulista, Julio de Mesquita Filho, Brazil; email: affonso@itapeva.unesp.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019578783

Nevertheless, the accurate estimation of permeability in carbonate rock reservoirs is considered a challenging task. This is due to two main reasons: (i) the extreme heterogeneity typically contained in these kinds of rocks; (ii) the fact that the permeability of carbonate rocks can vary enormously (from 0.01 mD to more than 1000 mD). In this paper, we explore a methodology to estimate permeability, from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, based on the combination of classification and regression techniques. This proposal works in two steps. First, data preprocessing and classification algorithms are applied to the original target dataset in order to build a classification model that is able to identify the permeability class zone – among four possible ranges – of a new rock sample. In the second step, according to the predicted permeability class zone, a specialized regression model is selected and will be responsible for determining the final permeability continuous value of the new rock sample. We evaluated this approach over a dataset formed by 1H NMR relaxation responses of 78 rock samples and their respective laboratory-measured permeability values. The obtained results revealed that the proposed approach, which combines classification and regression, led to more uniform and accurate predictions (RMSE = 0.413 and r2 = 0.888) compared with the use of regression in a stand-alone manner (RMSE = 0.641 and r2 = 0.735). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data mining; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Permeability; Regression","Carbonates; Classification (of information); Data mining; Mechanical permeability; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Regression analysis; Rocks; Sedimentary rocks; Carbonate rock reservoir; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Improving permeabilities; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Regression; Regression techniques; Petroleum reservoir engineering; carbonate rock; classification; data mining; hydrocarbon reservoir; nuclear magnetic resonance; permeability; regression analysis; reservoir rock","da Silva, P.N.; Universidade Federal Fluminense, Instituto de Computação, Av.

However, efficient methods for systemic organization of digital libraries are required, since users need to classify the available music files. When an automatic classification is desired, the extraction of input attributes and an efficient system, able to process them, are needed. In this context, the use of decision trees as a tool to predict musical genres classes allows the monitoring of the ramification, since nodes and branches of the tree can be accessed in this process. Decision tree is a technique very useful in data mining to extract information of a data set, normally using a TDIDT (Top-Down Induction Decision Tree) algorithm. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to propose an automatic classification method for Latin musical genres, by applying decision tree approach. The real database used is named Latin Music Database [20]. Two algorithms are executed: CART (Classification and Regression Tree) [2] and C4.5 [18], which have constructive criteria distinguished.

The active fire data were screened to prevent extraction of unrepresentative burned area samples and combined with surface reflectance bi-weekly composites to produce burned area maps. The procedure was applied over the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, validated with reference maps obtained from Landsat images and compared with the Collection 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area product (MCD64A1) Results show that the algorithm developed improved the detection of small-sized scars and displayed results more similar to the reference data than MCD64A1. Unlike active fire-based region growing algorithms, the proposed approach allows for the detection and mapping of burn scars without active fires, thus eliminating a potential source of omission error.

We found a better number of two clusters within the data, which can refer to the approximated number of sources of the drug which supply the cities of seizures. The C4.5 model was capable of differentiating the ecstasy samples from the two clusters with high prediction accuracy using the leave-one-out cross-validation. The model used only Nd, Ni, and Pb concentration values in the classification of the samples. © 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","chemometrics; clustering; data mining; ecstasy; forensic science; forensic toxicology; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry","midomafetamine; street drug; algorithm; Brazil; chemistry; cluster analysis; decision tree; drug contamination; drug traffic; human; mass spectrometry; procedures; tablet; Algorithms; Brazil; Cluster Analysis; Decision Trees; Drug Contamination; Drug Trafficking; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Street Drugs; Tablets","Barbosa, R.M.; Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal de GoiásBrazil; email: rommel@inf.ufg.br",,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",00221198,,JFSCA,"28205217","English","J.

In general, the process of reading the value of a variable might involve some cost. This cost should be taken into account when deciding the next variable to read. The goal is to design a strategy for evaluating the function incurring little cost (in the worst case or in expectation according to a prior distribution on the possible variables’ assignments). Our algorithm builds a strategy (decision tree) which attains a logarithmic approximation simultaneously for the expected and worst cost spent.

Usually, these interactions trigger very particular accident sequences, which are hard to predict but capable of producing exacerbated societal reactions and impair communication channels among stakeholders. Thus, the purpose of this work is to convert high-dimensional accident data into a convenient graphical alternative, in order to overcome barriers to communicate risk and enable stakeholders to fully understand and learn from major accidents. This paper first discusses contemporary views and biases related to human errors in major accidents. The second part applies an artificial neural network approach to a major accident dataset, to disclose common patterns and significant features.

Accordingly, efforts to control these hazards and manage risks are increasingly made, supported by improved computational capabilities and the application of sophisticated safety and reliability models. Recent events, however, have revealed that apparently rare or seemingly unforeseen scenarios, involving complex interactions between human factors, technologies and organisations, are capable of triggering major catastrophes. The purpose of this work is to enhance stakeholders’ trust in risk management by developing a framework to verify if tendencies and patterns observed in major accidents were appropriately contemplated by risk studies. This paper first discusses the main accident theories underpinning major catastrophes. Then, an accident dataset containing contributing factors from major events occurred in high-technology industrial domains serves as basis for the application of a clustering and data mining technique (self-organising maps – SOM), allowing the exploration of accident information gathered from in-depth investigations. Results enabled the disclosure of common patterns in major accidents, leading to the development of an attribute list to validate risk assessment studies to ensure that the influence of human factors, technological issues and organisational aspects was properly taken into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Human factors; Learning from accidents; MATA-D; Organisations; Risk studies validation; Self-organising maps","Accidents; Computation theory; Data mining; Disasters; Hazards; Human engineering; Risk management; Self organizing maps; Societies and institutions; Computational capability; Contributing factor; High technology; Learning from accidents; Major accidents; Organisational aspects; Organisations; Reliability model; Risk assessment; accident; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; biotechnology; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data mining; human; priority journal; reliability; risk assessment; risk management; safety; self organising maps; validation study","Moura, R.; Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, University of Liverpool, Chadwick Building, Peach Street, United Kingdom",,"Elsevier B.V.",09257535,,SSCIE,,"English","Saf.

These objects usually generate larges amount of data, transferring the bottleneck of data processing from sensors to communication systems. For example, analyzing IoT data often demands data centralization before running a mining algorithm. Thus, in order to reduce the data transference commonly required by the data clustering task, this paper proposes a grid-based data summarization approach. The proposed approach uses a single uniform grid to partition the space into cells and to summarize data before centralization. Summarization ensures the reduction of the amounts of data transferred. This approach also includes a data clustering algorithm that deals with the summarized and centralized data. Our preliminary experiments revealed good results in terms of data compression and quality of clustering with a two-dimensional benchmark dataset. © 2017 ACM.","Clusterization; Data summarization; Distributed data mining; Internet of things","Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Data handling; Data mining; Internet of things; Benchmark datasets; Clusterization; Data centralization; Data clustering algorithm; Data summarizations; Distributed data mining; Internet of thing (IOT); Quality of clustering; Clustering algorithms",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450350969,,,"Portuguese","WebMedia - Proc.

Site owners can use this kind of information in order to understand more their public preferences. Sentiment Analysis can help in this task, providing methods to infer the polarity of the reviews. In these methods, the classifier can use hints about the polarity of the words and the subject being discussed in order to infer the polarity of the text. However, many of these texts are short and, because of that, the classifier can have difficulties to infer these hints. We here propose a new sentiment analysis method that uses topic models to infer the polarity of short texts. The intuition of this approach is that, by using topics, the classifier is able to better understand the context and improve the performance in this task. In this approach, we first use methods to infer topics such as LDA, BTM and MedLDA in order to represent the review and, then, we apply a classifier (e.g. Linear SVM, Random Forest or Logistic Regression). In this method, we combine the results of classifiers and text representations in two ways: (1) by using single topic representation and multiple classifiers; (2) and using multiple topic representations and a single classifier.

Users often need to analyze domain-specific data based on related data elements from multiple files during the execution of computer simulations. In a raw data analysis, one should identify regions of interest in the data space and retrieve the content of specific related raw data files. Existing solutions, such as FastBit and RAW, are limited to a single raw data file analysis and can only be used after the execution of computer simulations. Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWMS) can manage the dataflow of computer simulations and register related raw data files at a provenance database. This paper aims to combine the advantages of a dataflow-aware SWMS and the raw data file analysis techniques to allow for queries on raw data file elements that are related, but reside in separate files. We propose a component-based architecture, named as ARMFUL (Analysis of Raw data from Multiple Files) with raw data extraction and indexing techniques, which allows for a direct access to specific elements or regions of raw data space. ARMFUL innovates by using a SWMS provenance database to add a dataflow access path to raw data files. ARMFUL facilitates the invocation of ad-hoc programs and third party tools (e.g., FastBit tool) for raw data analyses. In our experiments, a real parallel computational fluid dynamics is executed, exploring different alternatives of raw data extraction, indexing and analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dataflow; Index raw data; Raw data analysis; Scientific workflows","Computational fluid dynamics; Data flow analysis; Data handling; Data mining; Extraction; Fluid dynamics; Indexing (of information); Information analysis; Work simplification; Analysis techniques; Component-based architecture; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Dataflow; Index raw data; Indexing techniques; Scientific workflow managements; Scientific workflows; Information management","Silva, V.; Department of Computer Science, COPPE, Federal University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: silva@cos.ufrj.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009830332

Many vibration-based techniques aiming at detecting small structural changes or even damage have been developed or enhanced through successive researches. Lately, several studies have focused on the use of raw dynamic data to assess information about structural condition. Despite this trend and much skepticism, many methods still rely on the use of modal parameters as fundamental data for damage detection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that modal identification procedures are performed with a sufficient level of precision and automation. To fulfill these requirements, this paper presents a novel automated time-domain methodology to identify modal parameters based on a two-step clustering analysis. The first step consists in clustering modes estimates from parametric models of different orders, usually presented in stabilization diagrams. In an automated manner, the first clustering analysis indicates which estimates correspond to physical modes. To circumvent the detection of spurious modes or the loss of physical ones, a second clustering step is then performed. The second step consists in the data mining of information gathered from the first step. To attest the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methodology, numerically generated signals as well as experimental data obtained from a simply supported beam tested in laboratory and from a railway bridge are utilized. The results appeared to be more robust and accurate comparing to those obtained from methods based on one-step clustering analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automated modal identification; Clustering; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring","Automation; Composite beams and girders; Damage detection; Data mining; Modal analysis; Parameter estimation; Patient monitoring; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring; Clustering; Clustering analysis; Modal identification; Modal parameters; Parametric models; Simply supported beams; Stabilization diagrams; Structural condition; Time domain analysis","Cury, A.; Department of Applied Computational Mechanics, University of Juiz de Fora, Rua José Lourenço Kelmer, Campus Universitário, Brazil; email: alexandre.cury@ufjf.edu.br",,"Academic Press",08883270,,MSSPE,,"English","Mech Syst Signal Process",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018763654

Most previous approaches are typically based on descriptors designed to work with images uniquely captured in the visible light spectrum. In contrast, this letter proposes a descriptor termed a multispectral feature descriptor (MFD) that is especially developed, such that it can be employed with image data acquired at different frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum. The performance of the MFD is evaluated by using three data sets composed of images obtained in visible light and infrared spectra, and its performance is compared with those of state-of-the-art algorithms, such as edge-oriented histogram (EOH) and log-Gabor histogram descriptor (LGHD). The experimental results indicate that the computational efficiency of MFD exceeds those of EOH and LGHD, and that the precision and recall values of MFD are statistically comparable to the corresponding values of the forementioned algorithms. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Image matching; local feature descriptor; log-Gabor filters; multispectral images","Bandpass filters; Computational efficiency; Data mining; Feature extraction; Filtration; Gabor filters; Graphic methods; Image matching; Light; Remote sensing; Standards; Electromagnetic spectra; Histograms; Image edge detection; Local feature descriptor; Log-gabor filter; Multispectral images; Edge detection","Nunes, C.F.G.; Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnologica de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: cfgnunes@dri.cefetmg.br",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1545598X,,,,"English","IEEE Geosci.

DPs aims to identify the sets of characteristics that better differentiate a target group from the others (e.g. successful vs. unsuccessful medical treatments). It becomes more natural to extract information from high dimensionality data sets with the increase in the volume of data stored in the world (30 GB/s only in the Internet). There are several evolutionary approaches for DP mining, but none focusing on high-dimensional data. We propose an evolutionary approach attributing features that reduce the cost of memory and processing in the context of high-dimensional data. The new algorithm thus seeks the best (top-k) patterns and hides from the user many common parameters in other evolutionary heuristics such as population size, mutation and crossover rates, and the number of evaluations. We carried out experiments with real-world high-dimensional and traditional low dimensional data. The results showed that the proposed algorithm was superior to other approaches of the literature in high-dimensional data sets and competitive in the traditional data sets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Discriminative patterns; Evolutionary algorithms; High dimensional data; Subgroup discovery","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Population statistics; Discriminative patterns; Evolutionary approach; Evolutionary heuristics; Extract informations; High dimensional data; High dimensionality; Medical treatment; Subgroup discovery; Evolutionary algorithms","Lucas, T.; Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Av.

The extractive solution may also be obtained from the propolis by-product (BP), transforming this waste material into a pharmaceutical active ingredient. Even if propolis does not show toxicity, when used as an extract over harmed skin or mucosa, the present ethanol content may be harmful to the tissue recovering, besides hindering the drug release. This study describes the development of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) as topical propolis delivery systems and the investigation of their in vitro and in vivo activities. The extracts were evaluated to guarantee their quality, and the lipid dispersions were characterized with respect to morphology (cryo-TEM), size and diffractometry (X-ray) properties. The occlusive capacity of formulations was also evaluated by an in vitro technique, which determines the occlusion factor. The drug entrapment efficiency (EE), as well as the in vitro drug release profile from the nanoparticulate systems was investigated as well. The size analysis performed through 90 days was favorable to a topical administration and the polydispersity index, though not ideal in all cases due to the high content of resins and gums from the extracts, were relatively stable for the SLN. The propolis extract contributes to the occlusive potential of the formulations. The human immortalized keratinocytes presented good cell viability when tested with both extracts (propolis and BP) freely or entrapped in the systems. SLN modified with propolis material provided an acceleration of the in vivo wound healing process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Formulation; Materials science; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured lipid carriers; Nanotechnology; Propolis by-product; Propolis byproduct","Byproducts; Controlled drug delivery; Data mining; Dispersions; Materials science; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Protective coatings; Targeted drug delivery; Ethanolic extracts; Formulation; Nanoparticulate system; Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC); Nanostructured lipid carriers; Polydispersity indices; Solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN); Wound healing process; Quality control; nanomaterial; natural product; propolis; solid lipid nanoparticle; lipid; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; propolis; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell viability; controlled study; drug design; drug determination; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; keratinocyte; mouse; nanomedicine; neutron diffraction; nonhuman; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; physical chemistry; priority journal; wound healing; X ray diffraction; chemistry; drug delivery system; nanotechnology; physiology; procedures; wound healing; Drug Delivery Systems; Lipids; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Propolis; Wound Healing","Bruschi, M.L.; Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Laboratory of Research and Development of Drug Delivery Systems, Department of Pharmacy, State University of MaringaBrazil; email: mlbruschi@uem.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09277765,,CSBBE,"28728086","English","Colloids Surf.

The Brazilian conventional citrus crop requires repeated application of agrochemicals to achieve satisfactory levels of productivity. The organic citriculture is an alternative production system, which is environmentally friendly and offers a safe food to consumers. However, it is difficult to determine if a food or plant was cultivated in organic or conventional system by just common observation, which makes the customers of organic food market vulnerable against fraudulent entrepreneurs. In this study, we present a data mining approach for the study of Brazilian organic citrus leaves which can aid in the certification of authenticity of the citrus leaves. The elemental composition is determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We developed classification models based on support vector machines and artificial neural networks capable of predicting whether a citrus leaf is organic or conventional through analysis of the concentration levels of the 14 chemical elements (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Rb, Si, Sr, and V) found in both types of leaves. Feature selection filter methods are used to determine the most relevant elements for the classification process. Our best model obtained was a support vector machine with approximately 88% prediction accuracy. The elements Mn, Mg, and Rb were evaluated as the most significant for the classification decision. This is the first paper which addresses the problem of classification of organic orange leaves based on chemical composition. The presented methodology is useful for attesting authenticity of organic citrus leaves and can be adapted for other organic food or substances. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Citrus leaves; classification; data mining; feature selection; inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)",,"Barbosa, R.M.; Alameda Palmeiras, Quadra D, Câmpus Samambaia, Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal de GoiásBrazil; email: rmbweb@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",00032719,,ANALB,,"English","Anal.

Association rules learning is a data mining technique that has been frequently used to discover evolutionary couplings. These couplings constitute a fundamental piece of modern change prediction techniques. However, using association rules to detect evolutionary coupling requires a number of configuration parameters, such as measures of interest (e.g. support and confidence), their cut-off values, and the portion of the commit history from which co-change relationships will be extracted. To accomplish this set up, researchers have to carry out empirical studies for each project, testing a few variations of the parameters before choosing a configuration. This makes it difficult to use association rules in practice, since developers would need to perform experiments before applying the technique and would end up choosing non-optimal solutions that lead to wrong predictions. In this paper, we propose a fitness function for a Genetic Algorithm that optimizes the co-change recommendations and evaluate it on five open source projects (CPython, Django, Laravel, Shiny and Gson). The results indicate that our genetic algorithm is able to find optimized cut-off values for support and confidence, as well as to determine which length of commit history yields the best recommendations. We also find that, for projects with less commit history (5k commits), our approach produced better results than the regression function proposed in the literature. This result is particularly encouraging, because repositories such as GitHub host many young projects. Our results can be used by researchers when conducting co-change prediction studies and by tool developers to produce automated support to be used by practitioners. © 2017 ACM.","Association Rules; Change Recommendation; Genetic Algorithm","Couplings; Data mining; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Open source software; Automated support; Change Recommendation; Configuration parameters; Empirical studies; Fitness functions; Open source projects; Regression function; Support and confidence; Association rules",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353267,,,"Portuguese","ACM Int.

To automatically cope with these tasks, usually classification models are generated through supervised learning techniques. Unfortunately, this type of learning usually demands a huge human effort to label large volume of texts to build accurate classification models. Since collecting unlabeled texts is easy and inexpensive in several domains, the generation of classification models through inductive semi-supervised learning has been highlighted in recent years. Inductive semi-supervised learning allows to build a classification model using labeled and unlabeled texts. In this scenario, the goal is to augment the set of labeled documents with unlabeled documents to better discriminate class patterns. Hence, fewer texts must be previously labeled. However, semi-supervised learning algorithms that consider texts represented in a vector space model usually obtain unsatisfactory classification performances and are surpassed by semi-supervised learning algorithms that consider texts represented in a network. Nevertheless, despite the classification performances, effective approaches based on networks are generated through the similarities among documents and the classification of a new document are also based on the computation of similarities. This implies to set parameters and compute similarities to both generation the networks and classification of new documents. This approach is not feasible to generate fast responses and consequently to classify a huge volume of texts. In this article, we propose an approach to induce a classification model through semi-supervised learning considering text collections represented by bipartite heterogeneous networks. Bipartite networks are easily and quickly generated, leading to classification performance equivalent or better than other approaches based on network or vector space model and allows a fast classification of new documents. The results presented in this article demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to (i) speed up semi-supervised learning, (ii) speed up the classification of new documents and (iii) surpass classification performance of other existing inductive semi-supervised learning techniques. © 2017","Bipartite heterogeneous network; Graph-based learning; Label propagation; Text classification; Transductive learning","Classification (of information); Data mining; Education; Heterogeneous networks; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Text processing; Vector spaces; Automatic text categorization; Classification performance; Graph-based learning; Label propagation; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning techniques; Text classification; Transductive learning; Supervised learning","Geraldeli Rossi, R.; Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Três Lagoas Campus Ranulpho Marques Leal, 3484, ZIP 79620-080, P.O.

In particular, its application in public healthcare is a crucial management task that can improve the quality of the health services and avoid loss of huge amounts of money. In this work we propose and evaluate, in a real scenario, a method for anomaly detection in healthcare based on a provider-consumer model. Our method is divided into two phases. In the first phase it assigns anomaly scores to the cities (consumers) as a function of their demand, then, in the second phase, it transfers the scores from cities to hospitals (providers). We applied the method to a real database from the Brazilian public healthcare that records medical procedures which cost more than $8.5 billion from 2008 to 2012, and demonstrated our method's ability to find potentially fraudulent hospitals. The method is being adopted by the Brazilian government for selecting anomalous hospitals to be investigated. Our main contributions are (i) a simple and effective method for anomaly detection in healthcare; (ii) our method does not require information about the providers nor medical rules; (iii) the analysis from the consumer perspective allows the detection of anomalies that could not be detected with traditional methods; and (iv) we applied the method to a real database and performed a detailed validation. © 2017 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Data mining; Healthcare management","Data mining; Hospitals; Anomaly detection; Health services; Health-care managements; Health-care system; ITS applications; Management tasks; Medical procedures; Public healthcares; Health care",,"Cummins M.Facelli J.Meixner G.Giraud-Carrier C.Nakajima H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509048816,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The Big Data Era brought a new challenge to data acquisition: The need for eliminating user intervention. In this context, the domain-centric data extraction (DCDE) methods arose through replacing user intervention with content redundancy. The DCDE methods extract the attribute values of entities of the web that are restricted to a specific application domain. A research gap was identified from various analyzed methods, i.e., the DCDE methods are not effective in extracting attribute values that are differently presented within the same website. We have responded to this research gap by proposing the R-Extractor method, which extends a state-of-the-art DCDE method by adding a reinforcement stage for the treatment of attribute values that are differently presented within the same website. The R-Extractor method re-analyzes the extraction rules to identify those that can be combined to extract the values of a given attribute from all the pages that describe entities on a website. This identification is based on a novel score function that takes into account different features of the extraction rules. We carried out experiments on a dataset with more than 50k web pages from different real-world websites of a wide range of application domains. The R-Extractor method reached 98% of precision. Our method was compared with two baselines (an XPath-based method and a tree-based method) and outperformed them with an increase in precision up to 14%. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Data Extraction; Entity-Page","Application programs; Big data; Computer software; Data acquisition; Extraction; Websites; Attribute values; Data extraction; Entity-Page; Extraction rule; State of the art; Structured data; Tree-based methods; User intervention; Data mining",,"Demartini C.Conte T.Nakamura M.Lung C.-H.Zhang Z.Hasan K.Reisman S.Liu L.Claycomb W.Takakura H.Yang J.-J.Tovar E.Cimato S.Ahamed S.I.Akiyama T.","IEEE Computer Society",07303157,9781538603673,PSICD,,"English","Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031938570

To help in this task, we find in the literature an increasing number of software reliability models (SRMs). However, none has proved to perform well considering different contexts. Due to this, the selection of the best model for a particular case is an important task. Most existing works on SRM selection need to test different models and decide based on how well the model fits the data and predicts the future events. Moreover, in general, they do not consider search-based models. Considering this fact, this paper introduces a Meta-learning approach for SRM selection. In such approach, some meta-features are used to indicate the best performing model. The approach is independent of the type of models to be selected, and can be used with different data mining algorithms. It includes the following activities: meta-knowledge extraction, meta-learning and classification. The activities meta-knowledge extraction and meta-learning are performed just once and generate a meta-classifier. Therefore, the meta-classifier is used to select the most adequate model for new projects (classification activity). The approach is evaluated in a set of experiments and the results do not show statistical difference between the Meta-learning approach and the choice of the best performing model. Otherwise, the results point out statistical difference between the Meta-learning approach and the choice of the worst performing model with a large stochastic difference according to the Vargha and Delaney Effect Size. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data mining; Meta-learning; Software reliability models","Algorithms; Data mining; Extraction; Reliability; Software testing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Adequate models; Data mining algorithm; Meta-classifiers; Meta-learning approach; Metalearning; Selection of software; Software reliability models; Statistical differences; Software reliability","Vergilio, S.R.; Computer Science Department, Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), CP 19:081, Brazil; email: silvia@inf.ufpr.br",,"Springer New York LLC",09288910,,ASOEE,,"English","Autom Software Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961782172

However, despite the growing popularity of these applications, some experiences can be frustrating when users are unable to correctly recognize Points of Interest (POI), objects, or places they want to visit or obtain more information. The misleading recognition can occur due to imprecise Global Positioning System (GPS) data or a lack of QR codes for interaction. Hence, this article presents a proposal that combines pattern recognition in images with geolocation information to improve the accuracy of the identification of POIs. The usage scenario is the identification of azulejos (tiles) on the facades of historic buildings in the city of Belém of Pará, Brazil. This issue is relevant based on similarities between azulejos and its huge amount of different types, whose variety of designs and colors of geometric forms can make the identification a hard task. The used methods to extract the azulejos' features were the co-occurrence matrix combined with color percentage, and the global positioning data to increase the accuracy of classification because similar azulejos can be geographically far apart. Tests were conducted using six machine learning algorithms (neural network, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machine) of different paradigms. The first results show that the pattern recognition in images combined with geolocation information is a promising approach for better identification of the POIs in MAR applications. © Rinton Press.","Azulejos; Image Recognition; Machine Learning Algorithms; Mobile Augmented Reality","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Building materials; Buildings; Computer vision; Data mining; Decision trees; Global positioning system; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image recognition; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Accuracy of classifications; Azulejos; Co-occurrence-matrix; Global positioning; Historic buildings; K-nearest neighbors; Mobile augmented reality; Points of Interest(POI); Learning algorithms",,,"Rinton Press Inc.",15504646,,,,"English","J.Mob.

Ordinarily, the data in web pages represent records from a database and are obtained using a web search. One of the most important steps for extracting records from a web page is identifying out of the different data regions, the one containing the records to be extracted. An incorrect identification of this region may lead to an extraction of incorrect records. This process is followed by the equally important step of detecting and correctly splitting the necessary records and their attributes from the main data region. In this study, we propose a method for data extraction based on rendering information and an n-gram model (DERIN) that aims to improve wrapper performance by automatically selecting the main data region from a search results page and extracting its records and attributes based on rendering information. The proposed DERIN method can detect different record structures using techniques based on an n-gram model. Moreover, DERIN does not require examples to learn how to extract the data, performs a given domain independently and can detect records that are not children of the same parent element in the DOM tree. Experimental results using web pages from several domains show that DERIN is highly effective and performs well when compared with other methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data extraction; Main data region; N-gram; Path expression; Rendering information; Visual information; Wrapper","Extraction; Trees (mathematics); Websites; Data extraction; Data regions; N-grams; Path expressions; Rendering information; Visual information; Wrapper; Data mining","Ferreira, A.A.email: ferreira@iceb.ufop.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064573,,IPMAD,,"English","Inf.

Users of such services have the power to share opinions and influence others. This creates an interesting scenario, where brands and institutions can have a digital presence to interact directly with their target audience. Universities around the world are also using those platforms for reaching out their students and staff, acting as a new channel for services and public relations. Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) principles can be applied in this scenario, for universities, and help them on the management of this relationship with their public. Thus, this work aims to apply SCRM methodology for a university Facebook fan page, through techniques of Sentiment Analysis (SA) and topic modeling (TM) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in order to find topics people are complimenting or complaining about in their comments. The main goal is to improve SCRM processes through the results and insights provided by those techniques.

We quantify this difficulty with a coefficient that measures the distance between the observed final results of sports leagues and idealized perfectly balanced competitions in terms of skill. This indicates the relative presence of luck and skill. We collected and analyzed all games from 198 sports leagues comprising 1503 seasons from 84 countries of 4 different sports: basketball, soccer, volleyball and handball. We measured the competitiveness by countries and sports. We also identify in each season which teams, if removed from its league, result in a completely random tournament. Surprisingly, not many of them are needed. As another contribution of this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to learn about the teams' skills and to decompose the relative weights of luck and skill in each game. We break down the skill component into factors associated with the teams' characteristics. The model also allows to estimate as 0.36 the probability that an underdog team wins in the NBA league, with a home advantage adding 0.09 to this probability. As shown in the first part of the paper, luck is substantially present even in the most competitive championships, which partially explains why sophisticated and complex feature-based models hardly beat simple models in the task of forecasting sports' outcomes. © 2017 ACM.","Graphical model; Sports analytics; Uncertainty quantification","Data mining; Forecasting; Graphic methods; A-coefficient; Feature-based model; GraphicaL model; Probabilistic graphical models; Relative weights; Sports events; Sports prediction; Uncertainty quantifications; Sports",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348874,,,"English","Proc.

Structural identity has been studied in theory and practice over the past decades, but only recently has it been addressed with representational learning techniques. This work presents struc2vec, a novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations for the structural identity of nodes. struc2vec uses a hierarchy to measure node similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes. Numerical experiments indicate that state-of-the-art techniques for learning node representations fail in capturing stronger notions of structural identity, while struc2vec exhibits much superior performance in this task, as it overcomes limitations of prior approaches. As a consequence, numerical experiments indicate that struc2vec improves performance on classification tasks that depend more on structural identity. © 2017 ACM.","Feature learning; Node embeddings; Structural identity","Information management; Classification tasks; Embeddings; Feature learning; Learning techniques; Numerical experiments; State-of-the-art techniques; Structural identity; Structural similarity; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348874,,,"English","Proc.

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students’ academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence in education; Automatic instructional planner; Automatic prediction; Educational data mining; Interactive learning environment; Learner modeling","Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Distance education; Failure analysis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Students; Artificial intelligence in education; Automatic instructional planner; Automatic prediction; Educational data mining; Interactive learning environment; Learner model; Education; academic failure; artificial intelligence; comparative effectiveness; data mining; human; human experiment; learning environment; model; prediction; student; support vector machine; university","Costa, E.B.; Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL)Brazil; email: evandro@ic.ufal.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",07475632,,CHBEE,,"English","Comput.

Statistical parameters are used to draw conclusions in a vast number of fields such as finance, weather, industrial, and science. These parameters are also used to identify variability patterns on photometric data to select non-stochastic variations that are indicative of astrophysical effects. New, more efficient, selection methods are mandatory to analyze the huge amount of astronomical data. Aims. We seek to improve the current methods used to select non-stochastic variations on non-correlated data. Methods. We used standard and new data-mining parameters to analyze non-correlated data to find the best way to discriminate between stochastic and non-stochastic variations. A new approach that includes a modified Strateva function was performed to select non-stochastic variations. Monte Carlo simulations and public time-domain data were used to estimate its accuracy and performance. Results. We introduce 16 modified statistical parameters covering different features of statistical distribution such as average, dispersion, and shape parameters. Many dispersion and shape parameters are unbound parameters, i.e. equations that do not require the calculation of average. Unbound parameters are computed with single loop and hence decreasing running time. Moreover, the majority of these parameters have lower errors than previous parameters, which is mainly observed for distributions with few measurements. A set of non-correlated variability indices, sample size corrections, and a new noise model along with tests of different apertures and cut-offs on the data (BAS approach) are introduced. The number of mis-selections are reduced by about 520% using a single waveband and 1200% combining all wavebands. On the other hand, the even-mean also improves the correlated indices introduced in Paper I. The mis-selection rate is reduced by about 18% if the even-mean is used instead of the mean to compute the correlated indices in the WFCAM database. Even-statistics allows us to improve the effectiveness of both correlated and non-correlated indices. Conclusions. The selection of non-stochastic variations is improved by non-correlated indices. The even-Averages provide a better estimation of mean and median for almost all statistical distributions analyzed. The correlated variability indices, which are proposed in the first paper of this series, are also improved if the even-mean is used. The even-parameters will also be useful for classifying light curves in the last step of this project. We consider that the first step of this project, where we set new techniques and methods that provide a huge improvement on the efficiency of selection of variable stars, is now complete. Many of these techniques may be useful for a large number of fields. Next, we will commence a new step of this project regarding the analysis of period search methods. © ESO, 2017.","Astronomical databases: miscellaneous; Infrared: general; Methods: data analysis; Methods: statistical; Stars: variables: general; Techniques: photometric","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Photometry; Stars; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Astronomical databases: miscellaneous; Infrared: general; Methods:data analysis; Methods:statistical; Stars: variables: general; Techniques: photometric; Time domain analysis","Ferreira Lopes, C.E.; SUPA (Scottish Universities Physics Alliance) Wide-Field Astronomy Unit, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory, Blackford Hill, United Kingdom; email: ferreiralopes1011@gmail.com",,"EDP Sciences",00046361,,AAEJA,,"English","Astron.

Due to its high incidence rate and several complications, the study of this disorder has been subject of numerous investigations in an attempt to determine its prevention and improve the treatment conduction. In this context, this paper uses a data mining (DM) technique, named random forest (RF), applied to health care to early identification of these disorders. It also presents the modeling, performance assessment, and comparison with other DM methods to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Results showed that the RF classifier had a regular performance, presenting the best values for true positive Rate (TP Rate) and recall in the prediction of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension compared to the other experimented classifiers. Even finding a good performance to predict hypertensive disorders, other tree-based methods need to be evaluated, as well as other DM techniques. Discovering reliable information of pregnant women suffering from the hypertensive disease is an important path to reduce the high rate of deaths, mainly, in developing countries where 99% of these deaths occur. © 2017 IEEE.","Data mining; Decision support systems (DSS); e-Health; Hypertension; Pregnancy",,,"Debbah M.Gesbert D.Mellouk A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15503607,9781467389990,,,"English","IEEE Int Conf Commun",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028319020

In these simulations, the type, location and fault impedance were used as parameters.

The MapReduce programing model provides the scalability needed, alongside with portability as well as automatic data safety and management. k-means is one of the most popular algorithms in data mining and can be easily adapted to the MapReduce model. Nevertheless, k-means has drawbacks, such as the need to provide the number of clusters (k) in advance and the sensitivity of the algorithm to the initial cluster prototypes. This paper presents two evolutionary scalable metaheuristics in MapReduce that automatically seek the solution with the optimal number of clusters and best clustering structure for scalable datasets. The first consists in an algorithm able to iteratively enhance k-means clusterings through evolutionary operators designed to handle distributed data. The second consists in applying evolutionary k-means to cluster each distributed portion of a dataset in an independent way, combining the obtained results into an ensemble afterwards. The proposed techniques are compared asymptotically and experimentally with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms also developed in MapReduce. The results are analyzed by statistical tests and show that the first proposed metaheuristic yielded results with the best quality, while the second achieved the best computing times. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; k-means; MapReduce; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Scalability","Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Iterative methods; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Scalability; Cluster prototype; Data mining algorithm; Distributed data; Evolutionary operators; K-means; Map-reduce; Meta heuristics; Number of clusters; Clustering algorithms; Article; automation; cluster analysis; combination fast evolutionary algorithm for clustering; computer heuristics; data analysis; data mining; evolutionary algorithm; k means; mathematical computing; metaheuristics; scalable fast evolutionary algorithm for clustering","Oliveira, G.V.; Institute of Exact and Technological Sciences-Federal University of Viçosa, Rodovia BR 354, km 310, P.O.

After the application of the classification algorithms, it was verified that the KNN classifier obtained the best accuracy before the use of the new attribute, but the best algorithm to predict avoidance in the context of this research was the Decision Tree J4.8, since the Even allows the interpretation of the factors that led to the final result.

However, the domain of knowledge contained in these games is large, which makes it difficult to discover and predict the course of a match. The present work proposes the application of classification algorithms to determine the team with more chances to win a match. Two classifications procedures were used, one based on the composition of heroes in each team and another considering the duration of the match. The experiments were performed on data collected from 123,326 matches of Dota 2, showing that it was possible to achieve approximately 77% accuracy.

This is because their data are generated in great quantity, and intermittently, besides that, the data are from a wide variety, and it is widely available to users. Through such data, it is desired to extract knowledge or information that can be used in decision-making activities. In this context, we have identified the lack of methods that apply data mining techniques to the task of analyzing the professional profile of employees. The aim of such analyses is to detect competencies that are of greater interest by being more required and also, to identify their associative relations. Thus, this work introduces MineraSkill methodology that deals with methods to infer the desired profile of a candidate for a job vacancy. In order to do so, we use keyword detection via natural language processing techniques; which are related to others by inferring their association rules.

Moreover, it provides support in setting up a plan for on-site quality surveys.

Extracting topics from short text is challenging because of the dependence of conventional methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in words co-occurrence, which in short text is rare and make these methods suffer from severe data sparsity. This paper proposes a general framework for topic modeling of short text by creating larger pseudo-document representations from the original documents. In the framework, document components (e.g., words or bigrams) are defined over a metric space, which provides information about the similarity between them. We present two simple, effective and efficient methods that specialize our general framework to create larger pseudo-documents. While the first method considers word co-occurrence to define the metric space, the second relies on distributed word vector representations. The pseudo-documents generated can be given as input to any topic modeling algorithm. Experiments run in seven datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods for extracting topics by generating pseudo-documents or modifying current topic modeling methods for short text show the methods significantly improve results in terms of normalized pointwise mutual information. A classification task was also used to evaluate the quality of the topics in terms of document representation, where improvements in F1 varied from 1.5 to 15%. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Pseudo-documents; Short text; Topic modeling; Word vector representation","Encoding (symbols); Information retrieval systems; Quality control; Set theory; Statistics; Topology; Vector spaces; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Pointwise mutual information; Pseudo-documents; Short texts; State-of-the-art methods; Topic Modeling; Topic modeling algorithms; Word vectors; Data mining","Pappa, G.L.; Computer Science Department, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: glpappa@dcc.ufmg.br",,"Elsevier Inc.",00200255,,ISIJB,,"English","Inf Sci",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013108572

Existing process assessment methods, although widely used, have limitations such as: dependence on the competencies of appraisers; high amount of effort and resources required; subjectivity to analyze data and to judge on the implementation of practices; low confidence in sampling and its representativeness. Currently, due to the increasing use of information systems to support process execution, detailed information on the implementation of processes are recorded as event logs, transaction logs, etc. This fact enables the usage of process mining techniques as a powerful tool for process analysis. It allows using a significant amount of data with agility and reliability for process assessments. Objective The objective of this paper is to present the development and application of a feasible, usable and useful method, which reduces the limitations of current SCAMPI method and defines how to apply process mining techniques in SCAMPI-based process appraisals. Method Research method comprises nine steps that were performed in a manner that raised questions in the first four steps were answered by the last four steps of the research design. Results The method “Process Mining Extension to SCAMPI” was designed, developed, applied in two cases and submitted for review by experts who judged it viable, usable, and useful. Conclusions As per this research, process mining techniques are suitable to be applied in software process assessments since they are aligned with the purposes of data collection and analysis tasks. In addition to that, the resulting method was judged by experts as something that reduces identified limitations of one of the most used process assessment method. © 2017","Data collection and analysis; Process mining; Process Mining Extension to SCAMPI; SCAMPI; Software process assessment","Data acquisition; Data collection; Development and applications; Process assessments; Process execution; Process mining; research methods; SCAMPI; Software process assessment; Data mining","M.

The ionosphere is a specific layer of the Earth's atmosphere located approximately between 50 km and 1000 km above the Earth's surface. As Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) – such as GPS, Galileo, BDS and GLONASS – use radio signals, these variations degrade their positioning service quality. Due to its location, Brazil is one of the places most affected by scintillation in the world. For that reason, ionosphere monitoring stations have been deployed over Brazilian territory since 2011 through cooperative projects between several institutions in Europe and Brazil. Such monitoring stations compose a network that generates a large amount of monitoring data everyday. GNSS receivers deployed at these stations – named Ionospheric Scintillation Monitor Receivers (ISMR) – provide scintillation indices and related signal metrics for available satellites dedicated to satellite-based navigation and positioning services. With this monitoring infrastructure, more than ten million observation values are generated and stored every day. Extracting the relevant information from this huge amount of data was a hard process and required the expertise of computer and geoscience scientists. This paper describes the concepts, design and aspects related to the implementation of the software that has been supporting research on ISMR data – the so-called ISMR Query Tool. Usability and other aspects are also presented via examples of application. This web based software has been designed and developed aiming to ensure insights over the huge amount of ISMR data that is fetched every day on an integrated platform. The software applies and adapts time series mining and information visualization techniques to extend the possibilities of exploring and analyzing ISMR data. The software is available to the scientific community through the World Wide Web, therefore constituting an analysis infrastructure that complements the monitoring one, providing support for researching ionospheric scintillation in the GNSS context.

Data mining supported by machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to find patterns and to build classifiers for the data. In order to make it possible, data should be represented in an appropriate format, e.g. attribute-value table, which can be built by feature extraction approaches, such as the cross-correlation (CC) method, which uses one signal as reference and correlates it with other signals. However, the reference is commonly selected randomly and, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate whether this choice can affect the ML method performance. Thereby, this work aims to verify whether the choice of an epileptic EEG segment as reference can affect the performance of classifiers built from data. Also, a CC with artificial reference (CCAR) method is proposed in order to reduce possible consequences of the random selection of a signal as reference. Two experimental evaluations were conducted in a set of 200 EEG segments to induce classifiers using ML algorithms, such as J48, 1NN, naive Bayes, BP-MLP, and SMO. In the first study, each epileptic EEG segment was selected as reference to apply CC and ML methods. The evaluation found extremely significant difference, evidencing that the choice of an EEG segment as reference can influence the performance of ML methods. In the second study, the CCAR method was performed, in which statistical tests, only in comparisons involving the SMO classifier, showed not-so-good results. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cross-correlation; EEG; Epilepsy; Machine learning; Predictive models; Signal processing","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Neurology; Signal processing; Attribute values; Cross correlations; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Experimental evaluation; Neurological disorders; Performance of classifier; Predictive models; Biomedical signal processing","Oliva, J.T.; Bioinspired Computing Laboratory, Computer Science Department, University of São Paulo, Avenida Trabalhador São-Carlense, 400, Brazil; email: jeffersontalesoliva@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",0924669X,,APITE,,"English","Appl Intell",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014013181

In Brazil, the health insurance companies implement a claim authorization process which assists in the detection of fraud and abuse. This process consists of a prior analysis of the services requested by providers, allowing them to detect patterns linked to fraud and abuse. This analysis is commonly performed manually, making the execution expensive and non-scalable. Health insurance companies have invested in the use of data mining and machine learning techniques to detect suspicious fraudulent patterns. However, the use of these techniques in claim authorization process is affected by the class imbalance problem, due to the fact that there are much more authorized service requests than unauthorized ones. This paper presents the investigation results of the effects of class imbalance in health insurance claims authorization domain. By means of an experiment, the performance loss of several classifiers was measured in different class distributions and also the performance recovery provided by treatment methods. The results show that the studied classification algorithms are affected differently by class imbalance. They also show that the recovery performance is lower the higher the class imbalance. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer system recovery; Crime; Data mining; Health care; Insurance; Learning systems; Class imbalance problems; Classification algorithm; Health care costs; Health care markets; Insurance companies; Machine learning techniques; Performance recovery; Recovery performance; Health insurance",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061815,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031025128

Epileptic seizures are the result of temporary electrical disturbances in the brain. This disorder can be diagnosed by electroencephalograms (EEG). Accordingly, data mining supported by machine learning (ML) methods can be used to find patterns in EEG and to build classifiers. However, the presence of physiological abnormalities is considered rare in medical data. Also, rhythmic activities in an EEG of a healthy person varies in different situations, such as with closed or opened eyes. Other issue is that normal and interictal epileptic EEG can contain similar patterns. In this work, we developed classifiers in order to differentiate EEG of healthy volunteers, with opened and closed eyes, from epileptic EEG. This approach was applied in an EEG set with 500 segments, in which cross-correlation and power spectrum methods were performed for feature extraction. Subsequently, predictive models based on one-class classification were built using the one-class support vector machine (OSVM) technique in addition to traditional ML methods, such as nearest-neighbor, artificial neural network, and two-class support vector machine (TSVM). The polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels were applied in OSVM and TSVM. To enable the use of traditional ML methods, the OCC was converted to two-class classification problem through assignment of negative (abnormal) class to each EEG segment that does not belong to normal (positive) class. In the evaluation, it was found that the OSVM classifier with RBF kernel reached the best values for all confusion matrix parameters, such as accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and false positive rate. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bioelectric phenomena; Data mining; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Neural networks; Neurology; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Electrical disturbances; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); One-class Classification; One-class support vector machine; Positive predictive values; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Two-class classification problems; Two-class support vector machines; Electroencephalography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061815,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030988162

Cross-language sentiment analysis is usually performed through machine translation approaches that translate a given source language into the target language of choice. Machine translation is expensive and the results that are provided by theses strategies are limited by the quality of the translation that is performed. In this paper, we propose a language-agnostic translation-free method for Twitter sentiment analysis, which makes use of deep convolutional neural networks with character-level embeddings for pointing to the proper polarity of tweets that may be written in distinct (or multiple) languages. The proposed method is more accurate than several other deep neural architectures while requiring substantially less learnable parameters. The resulting model is capable of learning latent features from all languages that are employed during the training process in a straightforward fashion and it does not require any translation process to be performed whatsoever. We empirically evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in tweet corpora based on tweets from four different languages, showing that our approach comfortably outperforms the baselines. Moreover, we visualize the knowledge that is learned by our method to qualitatively validate its effectiveness for tweet sentiment classification. © 2017 IEEE.","Character-based Embedding; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Convolution; Data mining; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Character-based Embedding; Convolutional neural network; Machine translations; Neural architectures; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Translation process; Twitter; Translation (languages)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061815,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029793143

We found significant differences among NFRs related-builds statuses. Thus, tools can be proposed to improve CI with focus on new ways to prevent failures into CI, specially for efficiency and usability related builds.

With the advance of sentiment analysis tools, software engineering researchers have investigated the interplay between developers' sentiment and software engineering tasks such as issue fixing times. However, there is a lack of studies analyzing whether there is a relation between developers' sentiment and builds performed by continuous integration servers. Build breakage is not desired as it represents a signal that something went wrong in the software development activity and that extra work or rework should be done. In this paper, we report an empirical assessment over Travis CI builds and the corresponding commits in order to understand a potential association between developers' sentiment and build breakage. We found evidence that negative sentiment both affects and is affected by the result of the build process, although the influence seems to be small. Also, we found that developers tend to be more positive when writing about the CI server in commit messages. © 2017 IEEE.","Continuous Integration; Human factors on Software Engineering; Sentiment Analysis","Data mining; Human engineering; Software engineering; Continuous integrations; Development activity; Empirical assessment; Human-to-human interactions; Negative sentiments; Potential effects; Sentiment analysis; Software design",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21601852,9781538615447,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Cervicalcancer incidence has significantly decreased in countries thatdeveloped systems for organized screening engaging medicalpractitioners, laboratories and patients. The system automaticallyidentifies individuals at risk of developing the disease and invitesthem for a screening exam or a follow-up exam conducted bymedical professionals. A triage algorithm in the system aims toreduce unnecessary screening exams for individuals at low-riskwhile detecting and treating individuals at high-risk. Despite thegeneral success of screening, the triage algorithm is a one-sizefitsall approach that is not personalized to a patient. This caneasily be observed in historical data from screening exams. Oftenpatients rely on personal factors to determine that they are eitherat high risk or not at risk at all and take action at their owndiscretion. Can exploring patient trajectories help hypothesizepersonal factors leading to their decisions?

No studies have assessed the reference standards for a Latin American population. Our aim was to establish the normal ranges of the ECG for pediatric and adult Brazilian primary care patients. Methods: This retrospective observational study assessed all the consecutive 12-lead digital electrocardiograms of primary care patients at least 1 year old in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, recorded between 2010 and 2015. ECGs were excluded if there were technical problems, selected abnormalities were present or patients with selected self-declared comorbidities or on drug therapy. Only the first ECG from patients with multiple ECGs was accepted. The University of Glasgow ECG analysis program was used to automatically interpret the ECGs. For each variable, the 1st, 2nd, 50th, 98th and 99th percentiles were determined and results were compared to selected studies. Results: A total of 1,493,905 ECGs were recorded. 1,007,891 were excluded and 486.014 were analyzed. This large study provided normal values for heart rate, P, QRS and T frontal axis, P and QRS overall duration, PR and QT overall intervals and QTc corrected by Hodges, Bazett, Fridericia and Framingham formulae. Overall, the results were similar to those from other studies performed in different populations but there were differences in extreme ages and specific measurements. Conclusions: This study has provided reference values for Latinos of both sexes older than 1 year. Our results are comparable to studies performed in different populations. © 2017 The Author(s).","Computers; Electrocardiogram; Epidemiology; Intervals; Waves","adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; Brazil; Brazilian; child; comorbidity; controlled study; data base; digital imaging; electrocardiogram; female; Framingham risk score; Glasgow outcome scale; heart rate; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; P wave; pediatrics; population differentiation; preschool child; primary medical care; priority journal; QRS interval; retrospective study; school child; T wave; treatment indication; very elderly; young adult; age distribution; automated pattern recognition; cardiovascular disease; data mining; electrocardiography; factual database; heart rate; infant; newborn; pathophysiology; predictive value; primary health care; procedures; reference value; sex difference; sex ratio; signal processing; software; standards; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brazil; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Predictive Value of Tests; Primary Health Care; Reference Values; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Software; Young Adult","Ribeiro, A.L.P.; Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Av.

Information collected from manual or electronic health records can also be used for purposes not directly related to patient care delivery, in which case it is termed secondary use. EHR systems facilitate the collection of this secondary use data, which can be used for research purposes like observational studies, taking advantage of improvement in the structuring and retrieval of patient information. However, some of the following problems are common when conducting a research using this kind of data: (i) Over time, systems and data storage methods become obsolete; (ii) Data concerns arise since the data is being used in a context removed from its original intention; (iii) There are privacy concerns when sharing data about individual subjects; (iv) The partial availability of standard medical vocabularies and natural language processing tools for non-English language limits information extraction from structured and unstructured data in the EHR systems. A systematic approach is therefore needed to overcome these, where local data processing is performed prior to data sharing. Method The proposed study describes a local processing method to extract cohorts of patients for observational studies in four steps: (1) data reorganization from an existing local logical schema into a common external schema over which information can be extracted; (2) cleaning of data, generation of the database profile and retrieval of indicators; (3) computation of derived variables from original variables; (4) application of study design parameters to transform longitudinal data into anonymized data sets ready for statistical analysis and sharing. Mapping from the local logical schema into a common external schema must be performed differently for each EHR and is not subject of this work, but step 2, 3 and 4 are common to all EHRs. The external schema accepts parameters that facilitate the extraction of different cohorts for different studies without having to change the extraction algorithms, and ensures that, given an immutable data set, can be done by the idempotent process. Statistical analysis is part of the process to generate the results necessary for inclusion in reports. The generation of indicators to describe the database allows description of its characteristics, highlighting study results. The set extraction/statistical processing is available in a version controlled repository and can be used at any time to reproduce results, allowing the verification of alterations and error corrections. This methodology promotes the development of reproducible studies and allows potential research problems to be tracked upon extraction algorithms and statistical methods Results This method was applied to an admissions database, SI3, from the InCor-HCFMUSP, a tertiary referral hospital for cardiovascular disease in the city of São Paulo, as a source of secondary data with 1116848 patients records from 1999 up to 2013. The cleaning process resulted in 313894 patients records and 27698 patients in the cohort selection, with the following criteria: study period: 2003–2013, gender: Male, Female, age: ≥ 18 years old, at least 2 outpatient encounters, diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (ICD-10 codes: I20-I25, I64-I70 and G45).

This disease has symptoms often confused with other febrile syndromes, such as dengue fever, influenza and viral hepatitis, often making diagnosis challenging. Improving the accuracy of early diagnosis of patients with leptospirosis will increase the speed of appropriate antibiotic treatment delivery, and both will improve clinical outcomes for this potentially fatal disease. The authors conducted an analysis of clinically and epidemiologically defined leptospirosis cases to predict disease using data mining classification algorithms They conducted four sets of experiments to evaluate the performance of the algorithms assessing their predictive accuracy of using different training and test datasets. The JRIP algorithm achieved 84% sensitivity using a dataset of only confirmed leptospirosis cases, and a specificity of 99% using a dataset of only confirmed dengue cases Therefore, the approach successfully predicted leptospirosis cases, differentiated them from similar febrile illnesses, and may represent a new tool to assist health professionals, particularly in endemic areas for leptospirosis, accelerating targeted treatment and minimising disease exacerbation and mortality. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Classification (of information); Data mining; Diagnosis; Patient treatment; Antibiotic treatment; Classification algorithm; Clinical outcome; Data mining classification algorithms; Health professionals; Potentially fatal; Predictive accuracy; Targeted treatment; Diseases",,,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518806,,,,"English","IET Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022224588

The advent of this field occurred in the early 2000s, and it has since become an interesting and growing area of interdisciplinary research, although the number of publications in Environmental Metalloprotemics is still very low compared to other metallomic areas. In this context, the evolution of Environmental Metalloprotemics in the last decades was evaluated herein through the use of bibliometric techniques, identifying variables that may aid researchers in this area to form collaborative networks with established scientists in this regard, such as main authors, published articles, institutions, countries and established collaborations involved in academic research on this subject. Results indicate a growing trend of publications over time, reflecting the interest of the scientific community in Environmental Metalloprotemics, but also demonstrated that the research interactions in this field are still country- and organization-specific. Higher amounts of publications are observed from the late 2000's onwards, related to the increasing technological advances in the area, such as the development of techniques combining atomic spectroscopy and biochemical or proteomic techniques. The retrieved publications also indicate that the recent advances in genomic, proteomic and metallomic areas have allowed for extended applications of Environmental Metalloprotemics in non-model organisms. The results reported herein indicate that Environmental Metalloprotemics seems to now be reaching a more mature stage, in which analytical techniques are now well established and can be routinely applied in environmental scenarios, benefitting researchers and allowing for further insights into this fascinating field. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bibliometrics; Data mining; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Metalloprotemics","academic research; atomic force microscopy; biochemistry; data mining; ecotoxicology; proteomics; analytic method; bibliometrics; data mining; ecotoxicology; human; publication; scientist; spectroscopy; cooperation; ecotoxicology; environment; medical research; proteomics; publishing; trends; United States; metal; Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Cooperative Behavior; Ecotoxicology; Environment; Humans; Metals; Proteomics; Publications; Publishing; United States","Hauser-Davis, R.A.; Centro de Estudos da Saúde do Trabalhador e Ecologia Humana, Fundação Oswaldo CruzBrazil; email: rachel.hauser.davis@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",01476513,,EESAD,"28319889","English","Ecotoxicol.

This broad availability of algorithms that perform the Feature Selection task gives rise to the difficulty of choosing, a priori, between the algorithms at hand, the most promising one for a particular problem. In this paper, we present the proposal and evaluation of a new architecture for the recommendation of Feature Selection algorithms based on the use of Metalearning. Our framework is very flexible since the user can adapt it to its proper needs. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of our proposal over other approaches in the literature, which involve steps that cannot be adapted to the user's local requirements. Furthermore, it combines several concepts of intelligent systems, including Machine Learning and Data Mining, with topics derived from expert systems, as user and data-driven knowledge, with meta-knowledge. This set of solutions coupled with leading-edge technologies allows our architecture to be integrated into any information system, which impact on the automation of services and in reducing human effort during the process. Regarding the Metalearning process, our framework considers several types of properties inherent to the data sets, as well as, Feature Selection algorithms based on many information, distance, dependence and consistency measures. The quality of the methods for Feature Selection was estimated according to a multicriteria performance measure, which guided the ranking process of these algorithms for the construction of data metabases. Proposed by the authors of this work, this multicriteria performance measure combines any three measurements on a single one, creating an interesting and powerful tool to evaluate not only FS algorithms but also to assess any context where it is necessary a combination to maximize a measure or minimize it. The recommendation models, represented by decision trees and induced from the training metabases, allowed us to see in what circumstances a Feature Selection algorithm outperforms the other and what aspects of the data present greater influence in determining the performance of these algorithms. Nevertheless, if the user wishes, any other learning algorithm may be used to induce the recommendation model. This versatility is another strong point of this proposal. Results show that with the characterization of data, through statistical, information and complexity measures, it is possible to reach an accuracy higher than 90%. Besides yielding recommendation models that are interpretable and robust to overfitting, the developed architecture is less computationally expensive than approaches recently proposed in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithm recommendation; Data quality; Machine learning; Symbolic metamodels","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Expert systems; Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Trees (mathematics); Complexity measures; Consistency measures; Data quality; Feature selection algorithm; Leading edge technology; Meta model; Performance measure; Pre-processing step; Learning algorithms","Parmezan, A.R.S.; Laboratory of Computational Intelligence, Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação, Universidade de São Paulo, Av.

Fast and weak methods, like ranking, are placed on the top of the cascade to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature set. Thus, strong and computationally demanding methods, placed on the bottom of the cascade, have to deal with less features. Three cascade combinations are tested with the Extreme Learning Machine as the underlying classification architecture. The Tennessee Eastman chemical process simulation software and one high-dimensional data set are used as sources of the benchmark data. Experimental results suggest that the cascade arrangement can produce smaller final feature subsets, expending less time, with higher classification performances than a feature selection based on a Genetic Algorithm. Many works in the literature have proposed mixed methods with specific combination strategies. The main contribution of this work is a concept able to combine any existent method using a single strategy. Provided that the Cascade Feature Selection requirements are fulfilled, the combinations might reduce the time to select features or increase the classification performance of the classifiers trained with the selected features. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme Learning Machine; Fault diagnosis; Feature selection; Tennessee Eastman process","Clustering algorithms; Computer software; Data mining; Electric fault currents; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Automatic fault diagnosis; Classification performance; Combination strategies; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; High dimensional data; Tennessee Eastman; Tennessee Eastman process; Classification (of information); Article; benchmarking; cascade feature selection; classification; classifier; controlled study; data processing; fault diagnosis; genetic algorithm; information processing; machine learning; software","de Assis Boldt, F.email: fboldt@inf.ufes.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013096190

Moreover, the similarity to a regular execution that can occur in these cases, especially in silent data corruption, makes distinction from normal executions difficult. In this paper, we develop a mechanism that can detect such anomalous executions based on changes in the memory access pattern of an application. We analyze memory patterns using a two-level machine learning approach. First, we classify the behavior of different memory access periods within applications using Gaussian mixtures. Then, based on these classifications, we construct matrix representations of Markov chains to obtain information regarding the temporal behavior of these memory accesses. Based on metrics of matrix similarity, we can classify whether the application behaves as expected or anomalously. Using gradient boosting on the metrics of matrix similarity, our technique correctly classifies more than 85% of all executions, identifying instances of the same application and different applications. We can also detect a range of faulty executions caused by benign or malicious permanent bit flips in the code section. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The negative LMPs are grouped by the K-means technique and then taken as a target. Starting from a large set of potential variables that influence the price of energy, a feature selection technique is applied to identify the most relevant attributes in pricing.

Geminiviruses are divided into nine genera, according to their insect vector, host range, genome organization, and phylogeny reconstruction. Using rolling-circle amplification approaches along with high-throughput sequencing technologies, thousands of full-length geminivirus and satellite genome sequences were amplified and have become available in public databases. As a consequence, many important challenges have emerged, namely, how to classify, store, and analyze massive datasets as well as how to extract information or new knowledge. Data mining approaches, mainly supported by machine learning (ML) techniques, are a natural means for high-throughput data analysis in the context of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Results: Here, we describe the development of a data warehouse enriched with ML approaches, designated geminivirus.org. We implemented search modules, bioinformatics tools, and ML methods to retrieve high precision information, demarcate species, and create classifiers for genera and open reading frames (ORFs) of geminivirus genomes. Conclusions: The use of data mining techniques such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to feed our database, as well as algorithms based on machine learning for knowledge extraction, allowed us to obtain a database with quality data and suitable tools for bioinformatics analysis. The Geminivirus Data Warehouse (geminivirus.org) offers a simple and user-friendly environment for information retrieval and knowledge discovery related to geminiviruses. © 2017 The Author(s).","Data mining; Data Warehouse; Geminivirus; Knowledge discovery; Machine learning; Random Forest","Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Biology; Classification (of information); Data warehouses; Decision trees; DNA; Genes; Learning systems; Losses; Molecular biology; Quality control; Throughput; Viruses; Bioinformatics analysis; Geminivirus; High-throughput sequencing; Machine learning approaches; Monocotyledonous plants; Phylogeny reconstruction; Random forests; Rolling circle amplifications; Data mining; bioinformatics; classifier; data analysis; data base; data mining; extract; extraction; Geminiviridae; genome; genomics; human; information retrieval; knowledge discovery; metabolomics; nonhuman; open reading frame; proteomics; random forest; species; transcriptomics; algorithm; biology; Geminiviridae; genetic database; genetics; machine learning; phylogeny; plant; procedures; virology; single stranded DNA; virus DNA; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; DNA, Single-Stranded; DNA, Viral; Geminiviridae; Machine Learning; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Plants","Fontes, E.P.B.; Universidade Federal de Viçosa, National Institute of Science and Technology in Plant-Pest Interactions/BIOAGROBrazil; email: bbfontes@ufv.br",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712105,,BBMIC,"28476106","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018788915

Existing solutions to build adaptive middleware usually concentrate on the use of software technologies like aspect oriented programming and computational reflection to face with the how issue. In this paper, we propose a solution to build middleware that is adapted at runtime 'when', whose adaptation decisions and actions are moved from the middleware to an external component 'where' and whose adaptation makes use of process mining techniques and software architecture 'how'. The adaptation process is triggered based on the verification of the middleware event log.

Furthermore, rock typing activity has been shown to be of key importance in several steps of formation evaluation, such as the study of sedimentary series, reservoir zonation and well-to-well correlation. In this paper, a methodology based exclusively on the analysis of 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation responses – using data mining algorithms – is evaluated to perform the automatic classification of carbonate samples according to their rock type. We analyze the effectiveness of six different classification algorithms (k-NN, Naïve Bayes, C4.5, Random Forest, SMO and Multilayer Perceptron) and two data preprocessing strategies (discretization and feature selection). The dataset used in this evaluation is formed by 78 1H-NMR T2 distributions of fully brine-saturated rock samples from six different rock type classes. The experiments reveal that the combination of preprocessing strategies with classification algorithms is able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 97.4%. © 2017","Classification; Data mining; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Rock typing","Carbonates; Carbonation; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Rocks; Sedimentary rocks; Automatic classification; Classification algorithm; Data mining algorithm; Data preprocessing; Discretizations; Formation evaluation; Petrophysical properties; Prediction accuracy; Data mining; algorithm; carbonate rock; data mining; nuclear magnetic resonance; rock mass classification","da Silva, P.N.; Universidade Federal Fluminense, Instituto de Computação, Av.

Given their ephemeral nature, data stream sources are expected to undergo changes in data distribution, a phenomenon called concept drift. This paper focuses on one specific type of drift that has not yet been thoroughly studied, namely feature drift. Feature drift occurs whenever a subset of features becomes, or ceases to be, relevant to the learning task; thus, learners must detect and adapt to these changes accordingly. We survey existing work on feature drift adaptation with both explicit and implicit approaches. Additionally, we benchmark several algorithms and a naive feature drift detection approach using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results from our experiments indicate the need for future research in this area as even naive approaches produced gains in accuracy while reducing resources usage. Finally, we state current research topics, challenges and future directions for feature drift adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Data stream mining; Feature drift; Feature selection","Data communication systems; Data mining; Surveys; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Data stream mining; Detection approach; Feature drift; Real-world datasets; Real-world problem; Research topics; Feature extraction","Barddal, J.P.; Graduate Program in Informatics (PPGIa), Pontifícia Universidade Católica do ParanáBrazil; email: jean.barddal@ppgia.pucpr.br",,"Elsevier Inc.",01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002827336

The aims here were to develop and validate predictive models for detecting undiagnosed diabetes using data from the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) and to compare the performance of different machine-learning algorithms in this task. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of machine-learning algorithms to develop predictive models using data from ELSA-Brasil. METHODS: After selecting a subset of 27 candidate variables from the literature, models were built and validated in four sequential steps: (i) parameter tuning with tenfold cross-validation, repeated three times; (ii) automatic variable selection using forward selection, a wrapper strategy with four different machine-learning algorithms and tenfold cross-validation (repeated three times), to evaluate each subset of variables; (iii) error estimation of model parameters with tenfold cross-validation, repeated ten times; and (iv) generalization testing on an independent dataset. The models were created with the following machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, artificial neural network, naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor and random forest. RESULTS: The best models were created using artificial neural networks and logistic regression. These achieved mean areas under the curve of, respectively, 75.24% and 74.98% in the error estimation step and 74.17% and 74.41% in the generalization testing step. CONCLUSION: Most of the predictive models produced similar results, and demonstrated the feasibility of identifying individuals with highest probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, through easily-obtained clinical data. © 2017, Associacao Paulista de Medicina.

In the post-genomic era, the growing number of sequences deposited in databases has been the reason why these databases have become a resource for novel biological information. In recent years, the identification of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in databases has gained attention. The identification of unannotated AMPs has shed some light on the distribution and evolution of AMPs and, in some cases, indicated suitable candidates for developing novel antimicrobial agents. The data mining process has been performed mainly by local alignments and/or regular expressions. Nevertheless, for the identification of distant homologous sequences, other techniques such as antimicrobial activity prediction and molecular modelling are required. In this context, this review addresses the tools and techniques, and also their limitations, for mining AMPs from databases. These methods could be helpful not only for the development of novel AMPs, but also for other kinds of proteins, at a higher level of structural genomics. Moreover, solving the problem of unannotated proteins could bring immeasurable benefits to society, especially in the case of AMPs, which could be helpful for developing novel antimicrobial agents and combating resistant bacteria. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Antimicrobial activity prediction; Data mining; Local alignments; Molecular modelling; Profile-HMM; Regular expression; Structural genomics","Antimicrobial agents; Biology; Database systems; Microorganisms; Molecular modeling; Pattern matching; Peptides; Proteins; Anti-microbial activity; Local alignment; Profile-HMM; Regular expressions; Structural genomics; Data mining; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; bioinformatics; biotechnology; data mining; database; exploration; gene expression; genetic analysis; genomics; molecular analysis; peptide; antimicrobial cationic peptide; biology; chemistry; data mining; genetic database; genetics; metabolism; molecular model; procedures; sequence alignment; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Models, Molecular; Sequence Alignment","Franco, O.L.; Centro de Análises Proteômicas e Bioquímicas, Pós-Graduação em Ciências Genômicas e Biotecnologia Universidade Católica de BrasíliaBrazil; email: ocfranco@pos.ucb.br",,"Elsevier Inc.",07349750,,BIADD,"28216008","English","Biotechnol.

In such a complex environment, the participation of authors became more specialized, hampering the task of evaluating authors according to their contributions. While some metrics were adapted to account for the order (or rank) of authors in a paper, many journals are now requiring a description of their specific roles in the publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationships between credited contributions and author's rank has been limited to a few studies. Here we analyzed such a kind of data and show, quantitatively, that the regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in papers follow three general patterns according to the nature of their contributions: (i) the total contribution increases with author's rank; (ii) the total contribution decreases with author's rank; and (iii) the total contribution is symmetric, with most of contributions being performed by first and last authors. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data retrieved from PLoS One and by devising a measurement of the effective number of authors in a paper. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the first and last authors being more likely to contribute more diversely in a scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in specific roles, such as collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of scientific contributions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Authorship contributions; Entropy; Science of science; Text mining","Data mining; Entropy; Authorship contributions; Complex environments; General patterns; Science of science; Scientific contributions; Text mining; Paper","Amancio, D.R.; Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of São Paulo, PO Box 668, Brazil; email: diego@icmc.usp.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",17511577,,,,"English","J.

Serum from non-infected healthy controls (NI) and HTLV-1-infected patients, categorized as asymptomatic (AS), putatively progressing to HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis - HAM/TSP (pHAM) or with clinical diagnosis of HAM/TSP (HT) were assayed in two-parallel flow cytometry platforms, referred as: Fix and Fix&amp;Perm protocols. Operating-characteristics analysis indicated that a single pair of attributes (“serum dilution/cut-off”) for Fix and Fix&amp;Perm protocols presented excellent performance for the diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection. Conversely, Fix and Fix&amp;Perm protocols displayed weak/moderate overall performances when applied with prognosis purposes of HTLV-1 infection. A panoramic snapshot provided by the reactivity boards revealed clearly the higher sensitivity of Fix&amp;Perm protocol for detecting seropositivity for HT, suggesting that stepwise combinatory criteria would improve the global performance of using a single pair of attributes. Three data mining strategies were tested, including endpoint titer analysis, heatmap assemblage and decision tree analysis. Bi-dimensional heatmap analysis demonstrated that, while the clustering profile of NI vs HTLV-1+ revealed segregation in opposite poles, AS vs HT presented discrete segregation but still displaying an intertwined distribution pattern. The combination of methods for segregating AS from HT displayed a moderate but superior global accuracy (85.7%; LOOCV = 71.4%). The comprehensive data analysis support that the combination of methods have improved the performance to the differential diagnosis of AS and HT, with direct association with laboratorial records, including serum cytokine levels and proviral load. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical follow-up; Diagnosis; Flow cytometry; HAM/TSP; HTLV-1","gamma interferon; immunoglobulin G1; interleukin 10; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; cytokine; Human T cell leukemia virus antibody; immunoglobulin G; Article; blood sampling; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; flow cytometry; follow up; HTLV-1 infection; human; major clinical study; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; asymptomatic disease; blood; case control study; cell line; cluster analysis; data mining; decision tree; differential diagnosis; disease course; high throughput screening; HTLV-I Infections; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; immunology; indirect fluorescent antibody technique; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; time factor; virology; virus load; Algorithms; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cell Line; Cluster Analysis; Cytokines; Data Mining; Decision Trees; Deltaretrovirus Antibodies; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; High-Throughput Screening Assays; HTLV-I Infections; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Viral Load","Coelho-dos-Reis, J.G.Av.

However, the lack of resources for languages other than English is even more critical for emotion mining. In this article, we investigate whether Multilingual Sentiment Analysis delivers reliable and effective results when applied to emotions. For this purpose, we developed experiments involving machine translations over corpora originally written in two languages. Our experimental framework for emotion classification assesses variations on (i) the language of the original text and its translations; (ii) strategies to combine multiple languages to overcome losses due to translation; (iii) options for data pre-processing (tokenization, feature representation and feature selection); and (iv) classification algorithms, including meta-classifiers. The results show that emotion classification performance improve significantly with the use of texts in multiple languages, particularly by adopting a stacking of weak monolingual classifiers. Our study also sheds light into the impacts of data preparation strategies and their combination with classification algorithms, and compares differences between polarity and emotion classification according to the same experimental settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emotion mining; Multilingual sentiment analysis; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Data handling; Data mining; Translation (languages); Classification algorithm; Comparative experiments; Data preprocessing; Emotion classification; Feature representation; Machine translations; Multiple languages; Sentiment analysis; Text processing","Becker, K.; Institute of Informatics, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre – RS, Brazil; email: karin.becker@inf.ufrgs.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064573,,IPMAD,,"English","Inf.

For this purpose, serum chemokine/cytokine levels were measured by cytometric-bead-array in HCV patients, categorized according to immunotherapy response as: non-responder/NR, relapser/REL and sustained-virologic-responder/SVR. The results demonstrated an overall increase of serum chemokine/cytokine levels in HCV patients. In general, therapeutic failure was associated with presence of a predominant baseline proinflammatory pattern with enhanced CCL5/RANTES, IFN-α, IFN-γ along with decreased IL-10 levels in NR and increased IL-6 and TNF in REL. SVR displayed lower baseline proinflammatory status with decreased CXCL8/IL-8, IL-12 and IL-17 levels. The inability to uphold IFN-α levels during immunotherapy was characteristic of NR. Serum chemokine/cytokine signatures further support the deleterious effect of proinflammatory baseline status and the critical role of increased/persistent IFN-α levels to guarantee the sustained virologic response. The prominent baseline proinflammatory milieu observed in NR and REL yielded a restricted biomarker network with small number of neighborhood connections, whereas SVR displayed a network with integrated cytokine connectivity. Noteworthy was that SVR presented a shift towards a proinflammatory pattern upon immunotherapy, assuming a pattern similar to that observed in NR and REL at baseline. Moreover, the immunotherapy guided REL towards a profile similar to SVR at baseline. Analysis of baseline-fold changes during treatment pointed out IFN-α and TNF as high-performance biomarkers to monitor immunotherapy outcome. This knowledge may contribute for novel insights into the treatment and control of the continuous public health threat posed by HCV infection worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Chemokines; Cytokines; HCV; IFN-α","alanine aminotransferase; alpha interferon; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; CXCL9 chemokine; cytokine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; RANTES; ribavirin; tumor necrosis factor; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; chemokine; cytokine; IL8 protein, human; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 8; macrogol derivative; peginterferon alpha2b; pharmacological biomarker; recombinant protein; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; blood analysis; controlled study; data mining; decision tree; female; flow cytometry; follow up; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; human; immunotherapy; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; parallel design; priority journal; protein blood level; sustained virologic response; systems biology; treatment response; virus load; blood; chronic hepatitis C; drug effects; drug monitoring; immunotherapy; middle aged; procedures; young adult; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Chemokines; Cytokines; Drug Monitoring; Female; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Immunotherapy; Interferon-alpha; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-17; Interleukin-8; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Recombinant Proteins; Viral Load; Young Adult","Teixeira-Carvalho, A.; Grupo Integrado de Pesquisa em Biomarcadores, Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou, FIOCRUZ/MG, Av.

This has led to the development of ontology-based conceptual modeling techniques whose modeling primitives reflect the conceptual categories defined in a foundational ontology. The ontology-based conceptual modeling language OntoUML, for example, incorporates the distinctions underlying the taxonomy of types in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) (e.g., kinds, phases, roles, mixins, etc.). This approach has focused so far on the support to types whose instances are individuals in the subject domain, with no provision for types of types (or categories of categories). In this paper we address this limitation by extending the Unified Foundational Ontology with the MLT multi-level theory. The UFO-MLT combination serves as a foundation for conceptual models that can benefit from the ontological distinctions of UFO as well as MLT's basic concepts and patterns for multi-level modeling. We discuss the impact of the extended foundation to multi-level conceptual modeling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conceptual modeling; Multi-level modeling; Ontology","Data mining; Ontology; Unified Modeling Language; Basic concepts; Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling languages; Foundational ontologies; Multilevel model; Multilevels; Ontology-based; Unified foundational ontologies (UFO); Modeling languages","Carvalho, V.A.; Ontology & Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO) Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)Brazil; email: victorio@ifes.edu.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",0169023X,,DKENE,,"English","Data Knowl Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018328902

A better understanding of aging can direct public policies that minimize its negative effects in the future. Over many years, several longitudinal studies of human aging have been conducted aiming to comprehend the phenomenon, and various factors influencing human aging are under analysis. In this review, we categorize the main aspects affecting human aging into a taxonomy for assisting data mining (DM) research on this topic. We also present tables summarizing the main characteristics of 64 research articles using data from aging-related longitudinal studies, in terms of the aging-related aspects analyzed, the main data analysis techniques used, and the specific longitudinal database mined in each article. Finally, we analyze the comprehensiveness of the main databases of longitudinal studies of human aging worldwide, regarding which proportion of the proposed taxonomy's aspects are covered by each longitudinal database. We observed that most articles analyzing such data use classical (parametric, linear) statistical techniques, with little use of more modern (nonparametric, nonlinear) DM methods for analyzing longitudinal databases of human aging. We hope that this article will contribute to DM research in two ways: first, by drawing attention to the important problem of global aging and the free availability of several longitudinal databases of human aging; second, by providing useful information to make research design choices about mining such data, e.g., which longitudinal study and which types of aging-related aspects should be analyzed, depending on the research's goals.

Earwax samples were collected from 26 diabetic patients of both types, analyzed by headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry and confronted to the volatile earwax composition of 33 healthy individuals. Data mining analysis was conducted using different models to discriminate the healthy individuals from the diabetic patients and to discriminate between both types of diabetes as well. The model with the best discriminating ability was found to be partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) after variable selection. The 6 most important biomarkers were ethanol, acetone, methoxyacetone, hydroxyurea, isobutyraldehyde, and acetic acid. The multivariate model constructed was validated using a test data set and was able to correctly predict all the samples. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built for the 6 variables for diabetes types 1 and 2 diagnoses. Among the 6 variables selected, methoxyacetone was the only biomarker able solely to perfectly discriminate between diabetes types 1 and 2. The method is simple, non-invasive, accurate, and highly accepted by patients. Significance Our method involves a volatolomic approach by headspace gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry as a single analytical technique combined with multivariate data analysis to detect biomarkers of diabetes in earwax samples. Our method was able to discriminate with high accuracy between 33 healthy controls and 26 diabetic patients as well as its types (1 and 2). Our method employing earwax, a “neglected biological matrix” not only has the advantage of non-invasive sampling but also overcomes the limitations of the applied procedures in other biological samples, involving no or minimum sample pretreatment, no external contamination and utilizing a simple sample collection technique. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Gas chromatography; Headspace; Mass spectrometry; Volatile metabolomics","acetic acid; acetone; alcohol; biological marker; hydroxyurea; isobutyraldehyde; methoxyacetone; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; adult; analytic method; Article; cerumen; clinical article; controlled study; data mining; diabetic patient; diagnostic accuracy; discriminant analysis; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; mass fragmentography; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; partial least squares regression; pilot study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sample; adolescent; cerumen; clinical trial; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Adolescent; Adult; Cerumen; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects","Shokry, E.; Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), Campus II, Samambaia, Instituto de Química (IQ) – Laboratório de Métodos de Extração e Separação (LAMES)Brazil; email: angeliqa26582@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",18743919,,,"28286320","English","J.

It is in this stage that data in a relational database are transformed for applying a data mining technique. This stage is a complex task that demands from database designers a strong interaction with experts having a broad knowledge about the application domain. Frameworks aiming to systemize this stage have significant limitations when applied to Credit Behavioral Scoring solutions. This paper proposes a framework based on the Model Driven Development approach to systemize the mentioned stage. This work has three main contributions: 1) improving the discriminant power of data mining techniques by means of the construction of new input variables which embed temporal knowledge for the technique; 2) reducing the time of data transformation using automatic code generation, and 3) allowing artificial intelligence and statistics modelers to perform the data transformation without the help of database experts. In order to validate the proposed framework, two comparative studies were conducted. Experiments showed that the proposed framework delivers a performance equivalent or superior to those of existing frameworks and reduces the time of data transformation with a confidence level of 95%. © 2016","Credit Behavioral Scoring; Data mining; Model Driven Development; Relational classification","Automatic programming; Data mining; Systems analysis; 00-01; 99-00; Automatic code generations; Credit Behavioral Scoring; Data transformation; Model driven development; Model driven development approaches; Relational Database; Metadata","Neto, R.; Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife-PE, Brazil; email: rosalvo.oliveira@univasf.edu.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007545437

Such instruments not only provide unmatched resolution, but they also allow measuring the peaks accurate masses that permit identifying monoisotopic formulae. However, data files can be large, with a major contribution from background noise and background ions. Such unnecessary contribution to the overall signal can hide important features as well as decrease the accuracy of the centroid determination, especially with minor features. Thus, noise and baseline correction can be a valuable pre-processing step. The methodology that is described here, unlike any other approach, is used to correct the original dataset with the MS scans recorded as profiles spectrum. Using urine metabolic studies as examples, we demonstrate that this thorough correction reduces the data complexity by more than 90%. Such correction not only permits an improved visualisation of secondary peaks in the chromatographic domain, but it also facilitates the complete assignment of each MS scan which is invaluable to detect possible comigration/coeluting species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Baseline correction; Chemometrics; Data mining; Hyphenated techniques; Profile spectrum","Data mining; Mass spectrometry; Spectrometry; Analytical separations; Background correction; Baseline correction; Chemometrics; High resolution mass spectrometry; Hyphenated techniques; Profile spectrum; Separation techniques; Separation; accuracy; algorithm; Article; data base; data processing; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolomics; noise; separation technique; urine; chemistry; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; procedures; ion; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Ions; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Weight","Erny, G.L.; LEPABE – Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy, Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, Portugal; email: guillaume@fe.up.pt",,"Elsevier B.V.",00219673,,JCRAE,"28267998","English","J.

Most of the current studies have been focusing on building tweet datasets which are later analyzed using offline tools. This paper introduces a new approach through the development of the TSViz tool which online collects and analyzes tweets seen as data streams (in an online and incremental fashion). Given a hashtag, TSViz online gathers all tweets associated to it and organizes a multidimensional data stream, which can be seen as a time series. TSViz has three main components: i) a Robot responsible for the online collection of tweets according to the selected hashtags (defined by users); ii) an analysis component which employs Statistics, Dynamical Systems and Machine Learning methods to extract information and patterns from data; iii) a Web visualization tool to support users' interpretation of results. In the context of this paper, we present results on hashtags associated with the Brazil's political crisis in an attempt to understand the impacts of the public opinion and their relationships to the impeachment of its president. Our analysis confirms the daily volume of tweets and the amount of new information suffered a significant impact along time due to specific events associated with the impeachment process. © 2017 ACM.","Big data; Data streams; Twitter monitoring","Big data; Data communication systems; Data visualization; Dynamical systems; Learning systems; Machine components; Online systems; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Data stream; Design approaches; Extract informations; Machine learning methods; Multidimensional data; Online collection; Political crisis; Web visualization; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450344869,,,"English","Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020904471

Data stream mining appears as an alternative to conventional methods of extracting patterns from these data while maintaining comparable performance. As an example of this phenomenon of data volume growth, video sharing services counts every day millions of hours of content watched, generating billions of views. This work applies a straightforward data stream mining technique, namely Hoeffding Tree, to a subset of video data stream. To do so, this work presents the concepts of data stream mining, focusing on classification methods and detailing the Hoeffding Tree algorithm. We propose a problem of predicting video popularity on video streaming services by applying this algorithm. A number of predictive models is generated with the intention of exploring video characteristics that can be used to predict its popularity before the video being sent to the sharing service. Two final predictive models are generated, reaching accuracy values of 34.5% and 43.4%. Also, the algorithm is implemented in Python and made publicly available, aiming to address the lack of this tool in the libraries of this language.

This paper proposes a disaggregated analysis of destination choices for intercity trips, taking into account aggregated characteristics of the origin city, an impedance measurement and disaggregated variables related to the individual, by applying nonparametric Decision Tree (DT) algorithms. Furthermore, each algorithm's performance is compared with traditional gravity models estimated from a stepwise procedure (1) and a doubly constrained procedure (2). The analysis was based on a dataset from the 2012 Origin-Destination Survey carried out in Bahia, Brazil. The final selected variables to describe the destination choices were population of the origin city, GDP of the origin city and travel distances at an aggregated level, as well as the variables: age, occupation, level of education, income (monthly), number of cars per household and gender at a disaggregated one. The comparison of the DT models with gravity models demonstrated that the former models provided better accuracy when predicting the destination choices (trip length distribution, goodness-of-fit measures and qualitative perspective). The main conclusion is that Decision Tree algorithms can be applied to distribution modeling to improve traditional trip distribution approaches by assimilating the effect of disaggregated variables. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CART; CHAID; Disaggregated analysis; Gravity models; Trip distribution modeling","Decision trees; CART; CHAID; Disaggregated analysis; Gravity model; Trip distribution; Data mining; algorithm; numerical model; spatial distribution; urban area; Bahia; Brazil","Pitombo, C.S.; Department of Transportation Engineering, School of Engineering of São Carlos, University of São Paulo, Av.

Early information on short-term inward bed demand from patients receiving care at the ED may reduce the overcrowding problem, and optimize the use of hospital resources. In this study, we use text mining methods to process data from early ED patient records using the SOAP framework, and predict future hospitalizations and discharges. Design We try different approaches for pre-processing of text records and to predict hospitalization. Sets-of-words are obtained via binary representation, term frequency, and term frequency-inverse document frequency. Unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are tested for feature formation. Feature selection is based on χ2 and F-score metrics. In the prediction module, eight text mining methods are tested: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Tree, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (Kernel linear) and Nu-Support Vector Machine (Kernel linear). Measurements Prediction performance is evaluated by F1-scores. Precision and Recall values are also informed for all text mining methods tested. Results Nu-Support Vector Machine was the text mining method with the best overall performance. Its average F1-score in predicting hospitalization was 77.70%, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.66%. Conclusions The method could be used to manage daily routines in EDs such as capacity planning and resource allocation.

We used analytical approaches, developed to cope with ""big data"", that require no 'a priori' assumptions about the behaviour of the target agents, to analyse a pooled tracking dataset of 272 elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) in the Southern Ocean, that was comprised of >500,000 location estimates collected over more than a decade. Our analyses showed that the displacements of these seals were described by a truncated power law distribution across several spatial and temporal scales, with a clear signature of directed movement. This pattern was evident when analysing the aggregated tracks despite a wide diversity of individual trajectories. We also identified marine provinces that described the migratory and foraging habitats of these seals. Our analysis provides evidence for the presence of intrinsic drivers of movement, such as memory, that cannot be detected using common models of movement behaviour. These results highlight the potential for ""big data"" techniques to provide new insights into movement behaviour when applied to large datasets of animal tracking. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"behavior; data analysis; driver; foraging; habitat; human; memory; Mirounga leonina; nonhuman; sea; animal; data mining; ecosystem; feeding behavior; locomotion; Phocidae; physiology; population migration; spatial analysis; Animal Migration; Animals; Data Mining; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Locomotion; Seals, Earless; Spatial Analysis","Rodríguez, J.P.; Instituto de Física Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)Spain; email: jorge@ifisc.uib-csic.es",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,"28273915","English","Sci.

The game play is a key element. It is the way in which players interact with a game. In general, this interaction starts easier and becomes more challenge along the game session. Commonly game developers try to make balanced games, but due to the big variety of age, genre and expertise among players, this is not a trivial task and sometimes the game may become too difficult for some users, thus becoming boring. In this article we focus on identifying one aspect in special: the cycles in a game session, which represent a sequence of actions that are played repeatedly by the player in certain parts of the game. These cycles tend to make the game tedious. This way, it is a top priority for game designers to identify cycles. In this article we propose an approach identifies cycles in games using sequential pattern mining algorithms over provenance data collected from the game session. Using the proposed approach, we are able to identify cycles in the game session and we evaluated the feasibility of our proposal with the 2D game “Super Mario World”, a well-known commercial title. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bad cycle identification; Game analytics; Game cycle; Gameplay analysis; Provenance data; Sequential pattern mining","Computation theory; Human computer interaction; Game analytics; Game cycle; Gameplay analysis; Provenance data; Sequential-pattern mining; Data mining","de Oliveira, D.; Universidade Federal FluminenseBrazil; email: danielcmo@ic.uff.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",18759521,,,,"English","Entertain.

The methodology embraces image segmentation, arterial vessel representation, characterization and comparison, data storage, and finally analysis. Validation is performed using a sample of 48 patients. Data mining of morphometric information of several coronary arteries is presented. Results agree to medical reports in terms of basic geometric and anatomical variables. Concerning geometric descriptors, inter-artery and intra-artery correlations are studied. Data reported here can be useful for the construction and setup of blood flow models of the coronary circulation. Finally, as an application example, similarity criterion to assess vasculature likelihood based on geometric features is presented and used to test geometric similarity among sibling patients. Results indicate that likelihood, measured through geometric descriptors, is stronger between siblings compared with non-relative patients. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recent studies have showed that performance on some ToM tests might be altered in AD, though to a lesser extent than in behavioural-variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD). It is however, unclear if this reflects a genuine impairment of ToM or a deficit secondary to the general cognitive decline observed in AD. Aiming to investigate the cognitive determinants of ToM performance in AD, a data-mining study was conducted in 29 AD patients then replicated in an independent age-matched group of 19 AD patients to perform an independent replication of the results. 44 bvFTD patients were included as a comparison group. All patients had an extensive neuropsychological examination. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that ToM performance clustered with measures of executive functioning (EF) in AD. ToM performance was also specifically correlated with the executive component extracted from a principal component analysis. In a final step, automated linear modelling conducted to determine the predictors of ToM performance showed that 48.8% of ToM performance was significantly predicted by executive measures. Similar findings across analyses were observed in the independent group of AD patients, thereby replicating our results. Conversely, ToM impairments in bvFTD appeared independent of other cognitive impairments. These results suggest that difficulties of AD patients on ToM tests do not reflect a genuine ToM deficit, rather mediated by general (and particularly executive) cognitive decline. They also suggest that EF has a key role in mental state attribution, which support interacting models of ToM functioning. Finally, our study highlights the relevancy of data-mining statistical approaches in clinical and cognitive neurosciences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alzheimer's disease; Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; Data driven; Data mining; Theory of mind","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; Brazilian; controlled study; data mining; executive function; Frenchman; frontal variant frontotemporal dementia; human; major clinical study; mental health; mental performance; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; principal component analysis; recall; single photon emission computer tomography; theory of mind; working memory; Alzheimer disease; cognition; female; male; memory; middle aged; physiology; psychology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Data Mining; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Theory of Mind","Bertoux, M.; Applied Dementia Research, Norwich Medical School, Bob Champion Research and Educational Building, University of East Anglia, James Watson Road, Norwich Research Park, United Kingdom; email: maxime.bertoux@cantab.net",,"Masson SpA",00109452,,CRTXA,"28012370","English","Cortex",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007235996

Additionally, graph representation is effective for the propagation of the few initial labels existing in training data. Graph-based SSL requires robust graphs as input for an accurate data mining task, such as classification. In contrast to most graph construction methods, which ignore the labeled instances available in SSL scenarios, a previous study proposed a graph-construction method, named GBILI, to exploit the informativeness conveyed by such instances available in a semi-supervised classification domain. Here, we have improved the method proposing an optimized algorithm referred to as Robust Graph that Considers Labeled Instances (RGCLI) for the generation of more robust graphs. The contributions of this paper are threefold: i) reduction of GBILI time complexity from quadratic to O(nklogn). This enhancement allows addressing large datasets; ii) demonstration of RGCLI mathematical properties, proving the constructed graph is an optimal graph to model the smoothness assumption of SSL; and iii) evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed approach in a comprehensive semi-supervised classification scenario with several datasets, including an image segmentation task, which needs a large graph to represent the image. Such experiments show the use of labeled vertices in the graph construction process improves the graph topology, hence, the learning task in which it will be employed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Graph construction; k-nearest neighbors; Label propagation; Semi-supervised learning","Classification (of information); Data mining; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Nearest neighbor search; Supervised learning; Graph construction; Graph-construction method; K-nearest neighbors; Label propagation; Mathematical properties; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised classification; Semi-supervised learning (SSL); Topology; Article; classification algorithm; data analysis; image segmentation; information processing; machine learning; mathematical computing; mathematical parameters; priority journal; semi supervised learning","Berton, L.; Department of Computer Science – ICMC – University of São Paulo, C.P. 668, Brazil; email: lilian.2as@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008251788

Current state-of-the-art works related to MPSoC debugging suffer from poor integration, scalability in data storage, and simple graphical data representation. This work proposes a modular debugging framework to aid the software development for large-scale MPSoCs. The framework contains two parts: back-end and front-end. The back-end contains a generic model for extraction and storage of communication and computation data. The frontend comprises a graphical debugging toolset, which provides intuitive debugging tools for the communication and computation data events. A key point of the proposal is to be generic and applicable to different MPSoC architectures due to the decoupling of the back-end and the front-end components of the framework. A data extraction layer abstracts the MPSoC architecture by defining a standard structure to database insertion. The framework is validated in an MPSoC platform described in SystemC RTL (clock-cycle accurate), addressing MPSoC sizes of up to 400 processors. © 2016 IEEE.","CAD tools; Debugging Tools; Frameworks; Many-Core; MPSoC","Application programs; Computer aided design; Data mining; Digital storage; Extraction; Multiprocessing systems; Software design; Software engineering; System-on-chip; Trees (mathematics); CAD tool; Debugging tools; Frameworks; Many core; MPSoC; Program debugging",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061136,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Knowledge bases (KB) used in most projects are represented in an ontology-based fashion, so the data can be better organized and easily accessible. It is common to map these KBs into a graph when trying to induce inference rules from the KB, thus it is possible to apply graph-mining techniques to extract implicit knowledge. One common graph-based task is link prediction, which can be used to predict edges (new facts for the KB) that will appear in a near future. In this paper, we present Graph Rule Learner (GRL), a method designed to extract inference rules from ontological knowledge bases mapped to graphs. GRL is based on graph-mining techniques, and explores the combination of link prediction metrics. Empirical analysis revealed GRL can successfully be applied to NELL(Never-Ending Language Learner) helping the system to infer new KB beliefs from existing beliefs (a crucial task for a never-ending learning system). © 2016 IEEE.","Graph Mining; Inference Rules; Machine Learning; Ontological Knowledge Bases; Ontologies","Forecasting; Graphic methods; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Ontology; Data availability; Empirical analysis; Graph mining; Implicit knowledge; Inference rules; Knowledge basis; Link prediction; Ontology-based; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035663,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Topic modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, were designed for this purpose. However, discovering high quality topics in short text collections is a challenging task. This is because most topic modeling methods rely on information coming from the word co-occurrence distribution in the collection to extract topics. As in short text this information is scarce, topic modeling methods have difficulties in this scenario, and different strategies to tackle this problem have been proposed in the literature. In this direction, this paper introduces a method for topic modeling of short texts that creates pseudo-documents representations from the original documents. The method is simple, effective, and considers word co-occurrence to expand documents, which can be given as input to any topic modeling algorithm. Experiments were run in four datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods for extracting topics from short text. Results of coherence, NPMI and clustering metrics showed to be statistically significantly better than the baselines in the majority of cases. © 2016 IEEE.","Short text; Text expansion; Topic modeling","Intelligent systems; Statistics; Co-occurrence; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Short texts; Social media; State-of-the-art methods; Topic Modeling; Topic modeling algorithms; Word co-occurrence; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035663,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

The second step comprehends the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) to evaluate the post content and identify the user. Finally, Baseline Updating (third step) consists of a continuous updating of the user baseline to support the current trends and seasonality issues of user’s posts. Experiments were carried out using a dataset from Twitter composed by tweets of 1000 users. All the three steps were individually evaluated, and the results show that the developed method is stable and can detect the compromised accounts.

Machine learning algorithms are useful tools to perform this task, but usually it is necessary to reduce complexity of data using feature selection algorithms. As usual, many algorithms were proposed to reduce dimension of data, each one with its own advantages and drawbacks. The variety of algorithms leads to either choose one algorithm or to combine several methods. The last option usually brings better performance. Based on this, this paper proposes an analysis of two distinct approaches of combining feature selection algorithms (decision and data fusion).

The records of events were examined in the immediate and in the short term, which corresponded to 5 and 30 days, respectively, using the data mining methods k-means and association rules, to identify the patterns that govern their behaviors with respect to the observed amount of precipitation. The results show an increase in the frequency of similar events, with the occurrences being separated by shorter periods in recent decades. The behavior of emergencies and disasters indicates that emergencies are expected for periods of 5 days, with low quantities of precipitation and for periods of 30 days with normal quantities of precipitation. Disasters are expected, for both periods of 5 and 30 days, in the higher quantiles of precipitation. Interrelations between floods, river overflows and landslides were identified in all cities, with at least one relationship between two of the hazards for each city. An apparent flood–river overflow–landslide cycle could explain the mechanics of their occurrence. The information provided by the results indicates the vulnerability of the cities over time, their low capacity to support normal quantities of precipitation and their high exposure to hydro-meteorological hazards. The products obtained could be used together with precipitation prediction to anticipate possible effects and to formulate adequate risk management policies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Data mining; Ecuador vulnerability; Floods; Landslides; Precipitation; River overflows","data mining; disaster management; flood; landslide; meteorological hazard; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; vulnerability; Ecuador","Briones-Estébanez, K.M.; Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Horácio Macedo Av., 2030, Brazil; email: katiusca.briones@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.

Among the many algorithms used in such task, Decision Tree algorithms are a popular choice, since they are robust and efficient to construct. Moreover, they have the advantage of producing comprehensible models and satisfactory accuracy levels in several application domains. Like most of the Machine Leaning methods, these algorithms have some hyper-parameters whose values directly affect the performance of the induced models. Due to the high number of possibilities for these hyper-parameter values, several studies use optimization techniques to find a good set of solutions in order to produce classifiers with good predictive performance. This study investigates how sensitive decision trees are to a hyper-parameter optimization process. Four different tuning techniques were explored to adjust J48 Decision Tree algorithm hyper-parameters. In total, experiments using 102 heterogeneous datasets analyzed the tuning effect on the induced models. The experimental results show that even presenting a low average improvement over all datasets, in most of the cases the improvement is statistically significant. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Supervised learning; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree induction; Decision-tree algorithm; Heterogeneous datasets; Hyper-parameter optimizations; J48 decision tree algorithms; Optimization techniques; Predictive performance; Supervised classification; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035663,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Graph-based algorithms have aroused considerable interests in recent years to perform transductive classification since the graph-based representation facilitates label propagation through the graph edges. In a bipartite graph representation, nodes represent objects of two types, here documents and terms, and the edges between documents and terms represent the occurrences of the terms in the documents. In this context, the label propagation is performed from documents to terms and then from terms to documents iteratively. In this paper we propose a new graph-based transductive algorithm that use the bipartite graph structure to associate the available class information of labeled documents and then propagate these class information to assign labels for unlabeled documents. By associating the class information to edges linking documents to terms we guarantee that a single term can propagate different class information to its distinct neighbors. We also demonstrated that the proposed method surpasses the algorithms for transductive classification based on vector space model or graphs when only a small number of labeled documents is available. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bipartite graphs; Graph-based learning; Label propagation; Text classification; Text mining; Transductive learning","Classification (of information); Data mining; Graphic methods; Information retrieval systems; Iterative methods; Text processing; Vector spaces; Bipartite graphs; Graph-based learning; Label propagation; Text classification; Text mining; Transductive learning; Graph theory","de Paulo Faleiros, T.; Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação, Universidade de São Paulo — Campus de São Carlos, Caixa Postal 668, Brazil; email: thiagopf@icmc.usp.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678655,,,,"English","Pattern Recogn.

However, surprisingly little progress has been made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems.

The 1-NN DTW is typically considered the most accurate model for temporal data. Nevertheless, some authors have recently proposed ingenious alternatives to the 1-NN DTW by using diversity of time series representation or by using DTW for feature extraction. In this paper, we explore diversity of time series representations and distance functions to obtain distance features, which in turn are used to train an SVM model. We argue that the scientific community has largely neglected a vast body of unconventional distance functions, and we present empirical evidence that distance features are better than the 1-NN DTW with respect to classification accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Accurate modeling; Classification accuracy; Distance feature; Distance functions; Scientific community; SVM model; Temporal Data; Time series classifications; Time series",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061662,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

While there has been significant progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DTW in recent years, in this work we demonstrate that an underappreciated issue can significantly degrade the accuracy of DTW in real-world deployments. This issue has probably escaped the attention of the very active time series research community because of its reliance on static highly contrived benchmark datasets, rather than real world dynamic datasets where the problem tends to manifest itself. In essence, the issue is that DTW's eponymous invariance to warping is only true for the main ""body"" of the two time series being compared. However, for the ""head"" and ""tail"" of the time series, the DTW algorithm affords no warping invariance. The effect of this is that tiny differences at the beginning or end of the time series (which may be either consequential or simply the result of poor ""cropping"") will tend to contribute disproportionally to the estimated similarity, producing incorrect classifications. In this work, we show that this effect is real, and reduces the performance of the algorithm. We further show that we can fix the issue with a subtle redesign of the DTW algorithm, and that we can learn an appropriate setting for the extra parameter we introduced. We further demonstrate that our generalization is amiable to all the optimizations that make DTW tractable for large datasets. © 2016 IEEE.","Dynamic time warping; Similarity; Time series","Optimization; Time series; Benchmark datasets; Classification algorithm; Dynamic time warping; Environmental sensor; Nearest Neighbor classifier; Real world deployment; Research communities; Similarity; Data mining",,"Bonchi F.Wu X.Baeza-Yates R.Domingo-Ferrer J.Zhou Z.-H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15504786,9781509054725,,,"English","Proc.

We derive the method from first principles and consider four particular relationships between background and foreground distributions.

In this context, it's possible to verify the feasibility of using ontologies in healthcare. The number of seropositive people in relation to HIV, and its early detection is still a problem in today's world, especially in Brazil. Therefore, this study reports the creation and evaluation of an ontology meant to be used in healthcare applications, focused on telehealth. This ontology's main objective is to define the profiles of patients who attend the health centers of a city. The ontology proposed here can be used in a range of applications related to healthcare, not only to HIV, but also other diseases categorized as chronic. The article details the creation of ontology and its grounding. The evaluation that was made is described and its results, which are considered promising, are commented. © 2016 IEEE.","AIDS; chronic diseases; healthcare; HIV; knowledge base; ontology; profile","Data mining; Health care; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Medical computing; AIDS; Chronic disease; Health care application; Health centers; Knowledge base; Knowledge base for applications; profile; Telehealth; Ontology",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016334,,,"Portuguese","Proc.

One particular type of representation that is very appropriate for these situations is the NetFeatureMap, which describes by means of features the relevant aspects that are inherent to the environment where the agent actuates. In renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. Thus, investigating adequate approaches that perform automatic selection of these features becomes a crucial task. In this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach that automatically selects appropriate features based on the frequency at which they occur in the states explored by the agent in the course of its acting over the environment. Such an approach is based on Frequent Pattern Mining. It is interesting to point out that there also exist Genetic Algorithms-based approaches that successfully cope with the same task. Unlike Genetic Algorithms that use heuristic functions to select the features, the present proposal uses real data contained in a specialized database for performing this task. Under the intent of investigating the efficacy of such a proposal, the authors utilize the domain of Checkers player agents as their case study, since they operate in a competitive environment with a very wide state space. This investigation is performed by means of tournaments in which agents whose features are selected by the approach proposed herein face others whose features are selected either manually or by Genetic Algorithms. The superior performance of the Frequent-Pattern-based agents in the tournaments proves the efficacy of the present proposal. © 2016 IEEE.","Automated Selection of Features; Checkers; Frequent Pattern Mining; Machine Learning; NetFeatureMap; State Representation","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent agents; Learning systems; Automated selection; Checkers; Frequent pattern mining; NetFeatureMap; State representation; Feature extraction",,"Esposito A.Alamaniotis M.Mali A.Bourbakis N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509044597,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Besides that, algorithms of instance selection can also be applied for removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances, before applying learning algorithms. In the last years, several approaches for instance selection have been proposed. However, most of them have high time complexity and, due to this, they cannot be used for dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we present an algorithm called CDIS that can be viewed as an improvement of a recently proposed density-based approach for instance selection. The main contribution of this paper is a formal characterization of a novel density function that is adopted by the CDIS algorithm. The CDIS algorithm evaluates the instances of each class separately and keeps only the densest instances in a given (arbitrary) neighborhood. This ensures a reasonably low time complexity. Our approach was evaluated on 20 well-known data sets and its performance was compared with the performance of 6 state-of-The-Art algorithms, considering three measures: Accuracy, reduction and effectiveness. For evaluating the accuracy achieved using the datasets produced by the algorithms, we applied the KNN algorithm. The results show that our approach achieves a performance (in terms of balance of accuracy and reduction) that is better or comparable to the performances of the other algorithms considered in the evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.","Data mining; Dataset reduction; Instance reduction; Instance selection; Instance-based learning; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Computational resources; Density-based approaches; Instance based learning; Instance selection; k-NN algorithm; Learning process; State-of-the-art algorithms; Time complexity; Data reduction",,"Esposito A.Alamaniotis M.Mali A.Bourbakis N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509044597,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The approach relies on data obtained from buses equipped with GPS devices, which act as mobile traffic sensors. It involves three main steps: (1) analysis of the bus network to determine which road segments are frequently traversed by buses; (2) computation of bus travel time patterns by segment; (3) evaluation of how much the bus travel time patterns vary when bus network changes take place. The approach combines graph algorithms and geospatial data mining techniques. It can be applied to cities served by a dense bus network, where buses are equipped with active GPS devices that continuously transmit their position.

With this result, it will be possible to identify the attrition profiles of students and implement corrective measures on initiating their studies. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification; College attrition; Data Mining; Deep Learning","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Machine learning; Classification algorithm; College attrition; Corrective measures; Data-mining tools; Early prediction; Institutions of higher educations; Public resources; Public universities; Data mining",,"Chen X.Luo B.Luo F.Palade V.Wani M.A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538614174,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Modern IP solvers are very complex programs composed of many different procedures whose execution is embedded in the generic Branch & Bound framework. The activation of these procedures as well the definition of exploration strategies for the search tree can be done by setting different parameters. Since the success of these procedures and strategies in improving the performance of IP solvers varies widely depending on the problem being solved, the usual approach for discovering a good set of parameters considering average results is not ideal. In this work we propose a comprehensive approach for the automatic tuning of Integer Programming solvers where the characteristics of instances are considered. Computational experiments in a diverse set of 308 benchmark instances using the open source COIN-OR CBC solver were performed with different parameter sets and the results were processed by data mining algorithms. The results were encouraging: when trained with a portion of the database the algorithms were able to predict better parameters for the remaining instances in 84% of the cases. The selection of a single best parameter setting would provide an improvement in only 56% of instances, showing that great improvements can be obtained with our approach. © 2017 The Authors.

Although conventional High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms can deliver such performance, they are commonly expensive and power-hungry. This paper presents a study of an unconventional low-cost energy-efficient HPC cluster composed of Raspberry Pi nodes. The performance, power and energy efficiency obtained from this unconventional platform is compared with a well-known coprocessor used in HPC (Intel Xeon Phi) for two data mining algorithms: Apriori and K-Means. The experimental results showed that the Raspberry Pi cluster can consume up to 88.35% and 85.17% less power than Intel Xeon Phi when running Apriori and K-Means, respectively, and up to 45.51% less energy when running Apriori. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Apriori; Intel Xeon Phi; K-means; Raspberry Pi cluster","Big data; Clustering algorithms; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Apriori; Data mining algorithm; Extract informations; High performance computing (HPC); Intel Xeon Phi; K-means; Raspberry Pi cluster; Reliable results; Data mining","Souza, M.A.; Computer Architecture and Parallel Processor Team (CArT), Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas)Brazil; email: matheus.alcantara@sga.pucminas.br","Dutot P.-F.Desprez F.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319589428,,,"English","Lect.

Recently, many computational methods and techniques have been developed to predict distinct properties of concrete. However, a practical use of these solutions requires a high degree of engineering expertise and programming skills. Alternatively, this work advocates that software packages with off-the-shelf data mining algorithms can empower researchers and engineers on this task, while demanding less effort. In this direction, we present a detailed study on the use of Weka, evaluating different regression algorithms for predicting the compressive strength of concrete. Using the most complete dataset available at the UCI dataset repository, we demonstrate that most of the techniques available in Weka produces results close to the best ones reported in the literature. For instance, most of the evaluated predicting models generates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) inferior to 10, while the best result found is 8. Moreover, by fine-tuning the parameters of the regression algorithm Bagging with REPTree, we achieved a MAE value inferior to 3.3 for the evaluated dataset. Hence, the process considered in this study is also useful as a guideline to devise new computational models based on off-the-shelf data mining algorithms. © 2017 The Authors.

In Brazil, breast cancer mortality rates have been rising. Cancer classification is intricate, mainly when differentiating subtypes. In this context, data mining becomes a fundamental tool to analyze genotypic data, improving diagnostics, treatment and patient care. As the data dimensionality is problematic, methods to reduce it must be applied. Hence, the present study aims at the analysis of two data mining methods (i.e., decision trees and artificial neural networks). Weka® and MATLAB® were used to implement these two methodologies. Decision trees appointed important genes for the classification. Optimal artificial neural network architecture consists of two layers, one with 99 neurons and the other with 5. Both data mining techniques were able to classify data with high accuracy. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

To achieve greater productivity, it is essential to know the needs of the soil and the right moment to correct it. Mathematical and computational models have been used as a promising alternative to help in this decision-making process. The aim of this study was to model the influence of climate and physico-chemical attributes in the development of Eucalyptus urograndis in Entisol quartzipsamment soil using the decision tree induction technique. To do so, we used 30 attributes, 29 of them are predictive and one is the target-attribute or response variable regarding the height of the eucalyptus. We defined four approaches to select these features: no selection, Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-square test (X2) and Wrapper. To classify the data, we used the decision tree induction technique available in the Weka software 3.6. This data mining technique allowed us to create a classification model for the initial development of eucalyptus. From this model, one can predict new cases in different production classes, in which the individual wood volume (IWV) and the diameter at breast height (DBH) are crucial features to predict the growth of Eucalyptus urograndis, in addition to the presence of chemical soil components such as: magnesium (Mg+2), phosphorus (P), aluminum (Al+3), potassium (K+), potential acidity (H + Al), hydrogen potential (pH), and physical attributes such as soil resistance to penetration and related to climate, such as minimum temperature. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

To test the approach, we realized an experiment in with several large databases of Ministry of Social Development of Brazil to classify which relational database have a similar structure of tables and columns, based on its metadata. The measure of similarity considered Levenshtein and cosine. Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost Machines (GBM) techniques are applied to develop the model.

One example of relevant data in a non-structured format is observed in entity-pages. An entity-page publishes data that describe an entity of a particular type (e.g. a soccer player). Extracting attribute values from these pages is a strategic task for data-driven companies. This paper proposes a novel class of data extraction methods inspired by the graph databases and graph query languages. Our method, called Orion, uses the same declarative language to learn the extraction rules and to express the extraction rules. The use of a declarative language allows the specification to be decoupled from the implementation. Orion models the problem of extracting attribute values from entity-pages as Cypher queries in a graph database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models the problem of extracting attribute values from template-based entity-pages in this way. Graph databases integrate the alternative database management systems, which are taking over Big Data (with the generic name of NoSQL) because they implement novel representation paradigms and data structures. Cypher is more robust than XPath (a query language that is common used to handle web pages) because it allows traversing, querying and updating the graph, while XPath is a language specific for traversing DOM trees. We carried out experiments on a dataset with more than 145k web pages from different real-world websites of a wide range of entity types. The Orion method reached 98% of F1. Our method was compared with one state-of-the-art method and outperformed it with a gain regarding F1 of 5%. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Cypher; Data extraction; Graph database; Graph query language; NoSQL","Big data; Data acquisition; Data mining; Expert systems; Extraction; Information management; Query languages; Query processing; Websites; Cypher; Data extraction; Graph database; Graph query language; NoSQL; Trees (mathematics)","Manica, E.; II - UFRGSBrazil; email: edimar.manica@inf.ufrgs.br","Benslimane D.Sheth A.Damiani E.Hameurlain A.Grosky W.I.Wagner R.R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319644677,,,"English","Lect.

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture provides a greener alternative with low energy consumption for mining big data, bringing the power of thousands of processing cores into a single chip, thus opening a wide range of possible applications. In this paper (a substantial extension of the short version presented at REM2016 on April 19–21, Maldives [1]), we design a novel parallel strategy for time series learning, in which different parts of the time series are evaluated by different threads. The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications. Computational results show that the proposed GPU learning strategy is scalable as the number of training rounds increases, emerging as a promising deep learning tool to be embedded into smart sensors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Big data time-series; Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Household electricity demand; Hybrid forecasting model; Smart sensors","Big data; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Data mining; Deep learning; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Program processors; Smart city; Smart sensors; Time series; Amount of information; Computational results; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity demands; Hybrid forecasting; Hybrid Meta-heuristic; Low energy consumption; Time series forecasting; Graphics processing unit; algorithm; data mining; data processing; energy efficiency; forecasting method; graphical method; heuristics; household energy; numerical model; sensor; smart grid; time series; time series analysis; Maldives","Coelho, I.M.; Grupo da Causa HumanaBrazil; email: igor.machado@ime.uerj.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

This paper demonstrates that a hardware (HW) implementation of network security algorithms can significantly reduce their energy consumption compared to an equivalent software (SW) version. The paper has four main contributions: (i) a new feature extraction algorithm, with low processing demands and suitable for hardware implementation; (ii) a feature selection method with two objectives - accuracy and energy consumption; (iii) detailed energy measurements of the feature extraction engine and three machine learning (ML) classifiers implemented in SW and HW - Decision Tree (DT), Naive-Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN); and (iv) a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs in implementing the feature extractor and ML classifiers in SW and HW. The new feature extractor demands significantly less computational power, memory, and energy. Its SW implementation consumes only 22 percent of the energy used by a commercial product and its HW implementation only 12 percent. The dual-objective feature selection enabled an energy saving of up to 93 percent. Comparing the most energy-efficient SW implementation (new extractor and DT classifier) with an equivalent HW implementation, the HW version consumes only 5.7 percent of the energy used by the SW version. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","classifier design and evaluation; energy-aware systems; feature evaluation and selection; hardware description languages; Low-power design; machine learning; network-level security and protection; security and privacy protection","Artificial intelligence; Computer hardware description languages; Data mining; Decision trees; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Engines; Extraction; Feature extraction; Hardware; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Low power electronics; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Power management; Trees (mathematics); Classifier design and evaluation; Energy-aware systems; Feature evaluation and selection; Low-power design; Network-level security and protection; Security and privacy protection; Energy efficiency","Viegas, E.; Pontifical Catholic University of ParanaBrazil; email: eduardo.viegas@ppgia.pucpr.br",,"IEEE Computer Society",00189340,,ITCOB,,"English","IEEE Trans Comput",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007018423

Evapotranspiration is the combination process of transferring moisture from the earth to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration from plants. By estimating this rate of loss, farmers can efficiently manage the crop water requirement and how much water is available. In this work, we propose prediction models, which can estimate the evapotranspiration based on climatic data collected by an automatic meteorological station. Climatic data are multidimensional, therefore by reducing the data dimensionality, then irrelevant, redundant or non-significant data can be removed from the results. In this way, we consider in the proposed solution to apply feature selection techniques before generating the prediction model. Thus, we can estimate the reference evapotranspiration according to the collected climatic variables. The experiments results concluded that models with high accuracy can be generated by M5' algorithm with feature selection techniques.

Each transcribed mRNA sequence has only one part translated into proteins, called Coding Sequence. The detection of this region is what motivates the search for conservative characteristics in an mRNA sequence. In eukaryotes, this region usually begins with the first occurrence of the sequence of three nucleotides, being Adenine, Uracil and Guanine, the nucleotide set that it is called Translation Initiation Site. One way to look for conservative rules that define this region is to use the formal concept analysis that can have implications that indicate a coexistence between the positions of the sequence with the presence of the translation start site. This paper analyze the use of this technique to extract conservative rules to predict the translation initiation site in eukaryotes.

For this, an experimental study was carried out in which the traditional approach of constructing the conceptual model was confronted with the approach that uses this ontology.

It has now been used in conjunction with BMI (Brain Machine Interface) Systems, which allow the communication of an individual and external equipment, such as a computer, through brain stimulation, without any muscle movement. These tools typically present data in the form of graphs or topographic maps for monitoring or analysis of brain activities. In this work, a methodology of EEG analysis is proposed through data mining, which tries to extract knowledge from a large database. This paper presents a case study using EEG signals from visually impaired and sighted individuals during the execution of an activity that stimulated spatial ability. In order to verify the hypothesis that sighted use the sense of sight, even with blindfold, and visually impaired use the sense of touch to identify spatial geometric objects. An experiment was made and through the data of the recorded brain signals, decision tree techniques were applied to understand the main areas involved in the brain activities during the execution of the recognition task. The results suggest that the hypothesis is true confirming that visuall and sighted subjects activate different brain areas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Brain Machine Interface; Data mining; Decision tree; EEG; Electroencephalogram; Visual impairment","Brain; Brain computer interface; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Maps; Neurology; Neurophysiology; Trees (mathematics); Brain electrical activity; Brain machine interface; Brain stimulation; Decision tree techniques; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Geometric objects; Neurological examination; Visual impairment; Data mining","Adamatti, D.F.; Universidade Federal do Rio GrandeBrazil; email: dianaada@gmail.com","Barone D.A.C.Teles E.O.Brackmann C.P.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9783319710105,,,"English","Commun.

Our intention is to provide results that may support the study of medical investigation in the decision-making process in clinical bioethics, particularly in this work, in cases of euthanasia. The data used in the approach were collected from 75 students of the nursing undergraduate course using an eye tracker. The available data were processed through feature selection methods, and were later used to create models capable of predicting the euthanasia decision through ML algorithms. Statistical experiments showed that the predictive model resultant from the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm led to the best performance compared with the other tested algorithms, presenting an accuracy of 90.7% and a mean area under the ROC curve of 0.90. Interesting knowledge (patterns and rules) for the studied bioethical decision-making was extracted using simulations with MLP models and inspecting the obtained decision-tree rules. The good performance shown by the obtained MLP predictive model demonstrates that the proposed investigation approach may be used to test scientific hypotheses related to visual attention and decision-making. © 2017 The Authors.

However, most of SLRs are outdated and there is a lack of works that support the conduction of SLRs updates. Objective: The main goal of this paper is to report our experience in updating two of our SLRs. Method: To update these two SLRs, we used automated techniques based on VTM (Visual Text Mining) to guarantee the presence of relevant studies. Results: From our experience, some factors to satisfactorily update SLRs were identified: (i) to adopt software tools to support the updating process; (ii) to provide as much as possible information of previous SLR; (iii) to involve researchers from previous SLR; and (iv) to reuse protocol from preliminar SLR. Conclusions: Reported lessons learned can be used as a basis of knowledge to guide researchers when updating their SLRs.","Systematic literature review; Update; VTM","Computer software reusability; Data mining; Knowledge engineering; Automated techniques; Experience report; New study; Systematic literature review; Text mining; Update; Software engineering",,,"Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School",23259000,1891706411,,,"English","Proc.

This financial effort to promote access to medicines by the Brazilian population had the purpose of avoiding morbidities and, consequently, avoids hospitalizations. Therefore the present study aimed to contribute to improve knowledge management in health, applying a new knowledge management model (Buzeti's model), which allows the discovery of knowledge in public data of the ALICEWeb system. Initially, the existing methodologies that enabled the discovery of knowledge were studied, and the Buzeti's model was defined. It should be noted that concepts derived from Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) have been chosen, which allow the extraction of patterns, associations, rules, clusters and other forms of coding. The steps proposed by the Buzeti's model were performed: Selection of ALICEWeb system public data; data pre-processing and cleaning; transformation of data; data mining; and analysis and interpretation of ALICEWEB system information. The application of Buzeti's model guaranteed the accomplishment of the drug import forecast for the year 2016. We conclude that the use of the KDD methodology allows the creation of new knowledge from public data and the Buzeti's model can be used to improve the knowledge management in health.","Data mining; Knowledge discovery in databases; Public data","Commerce; Data handling; Information management; Knowledge management; Metadata; Access to medicines; Data preprocessing; Knowledge discovery in database; Knowledge management model; Pharmaceutical products; Public data; System information; Trade deficit; Data mining","Buzeti, L.; Analista de Sistemas, Universidade Estadual de LondrinaBrazil; email: buzeti@uel.br","Dessouky M.Grilo A.Cruz-Machado V.","Curran Associates Inc.",21648689,9780000000002,,,"English","Proc.

A simple but, widely used, approach to build graphs from vector-based data is to consider each data instance as a vertex and connecting pairs of it using a similarity measure. Although this abstraction presents some advantages, such as arbitrary shape representation of the original data, it is still tied to some drawbacks, for example, it is dependent on the choice of a pre-defined distance metric and is biased by the local information among data instances. Aiming at exploring alternative ways to build graphs from data, this paper proposes an algorithm for constructing a new type of graph, called Attribute-based Decision Graph–AbDG. Given a vector-based data set, an AbDG is built by partitioning each data attribute range into disjoint intervals and representing each interval as a vertex. The edges are then established between vertices from different attributes according to a pre-defined pattern. Classification is performed through a matching process among the attribute values of the new instance and AbDG. Moreover, AbDG provides an inner mechanism to handle missing attribute values, which contributes for expanding its applicability. Results of classification tasks have shown that AbDG is a competitive approach when compared to well-known multiclass algorithms. The main contribution of the proposed framework is the combination of the advantages of attribute-based and graph-based techniques to perform robust pattern matching data classification, while permitting the analysis the input data considering only a subset of its attributes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attribute-based Decision Graphs; Data-graph construction; Graph-based classification; Missing attribute values; Multiclass classification","Data mining; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Pattern matching; Attribute values; Data graph; Decision graphs; Graph-based classifications; Multi-class classification; Classification (of information); algorithm; Article; classification; data analysis; data mining; graph based algorithm; information processing; machine learning; mathematical analysis; priority journal; factual database; procedures; Algorithms; Classification; Data Mining; Databases, Factual","Bertini, J.R.; School of Technology, University of Campinas, R.

One of them is air pollution, which is co-related to human health and welfare. The city of Curitiba and its metropolitan area comprise around 3.5 million people, which are directly affected by over 1 million vehicles in the capital, and the diversified industries that continue to grow. This project consists of combining hospitalization data and other related urban variables such as climate and air pollution. This paper describes the methodology by using a data mining approach to explore data from 2008 to 2016 from Curitiba and six other cities. The aim of this study is to predict future cases of hospitalizations caused by respiratory diseases in Curitiba and the metropolitan area, and to consider atmospheric and air quality. The air pollution parameters used in this study are: suspended particles matter; PM10 (particles smaller or equal to 10 micrometers); sulfur dioxide (SO2); carbon monoxide (CO); ozone (O3); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and the air quality index (AQI). The climate variables are: wind direction; average wind speed; average maximum wind speed; potential and real evaporation; insolation; average cloud cover; total precipitation and days of precipitation; average atmospheric pressure; minimum, maximum and average temperature; and relative humidity. The results of this scientific project may be used by the government for developing actions and interventions aimed at minimizing the adverse effects on the environment and human health. It is also expected that the results could contribute to the planning of environmental, controlling air pollution and improving public policies. © 2017 WIT Press.","Air pollution; Data mining; Prediction; Respiratory diseases; Statistics",,,,"WITPress",1746448X,,,,"English","WIT Trans.

An object based approach allows the generation of attributes, increasing the dimensionality of the original dataset. Selection functions for relevant features and booster, available in the C5.0 algorithm, and the objects based analysis facilitate the classification of such datasets. This study aimed at: (i) to evaluate object classification approach in relation to the parameters of attributes selection (winnow), booster (trial) and Minimum Sample Size (MSS), (ii) to determine the most predictive features, and (iii) to compare the classification performance of both Decision Tree and Support Vectors Machine. A region growing method was used in order to segment the image. C5.0 algorithm was used in the classification procedure. The values of the trial (10) and MMS (5) parameters resulted in accuracies higher than 0.8. The kappa value was greater that the SVM, with these parameters. A significant decrease in the data dimensionality up to 30% was observed when the winnow parameter was habilitated.

For the per-pixel method, we used the supervised Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Both approaches presented equivalent results, with Kappa Index of 0.75 and Global Accuracy (GA) of 78.97% for the approach by GEOBIA and Kappa Index of 0.72 and GA of 77.44% for the per-pixel classification. The classification by GEOBIA showed better accuracy for the soil, forest and soybean classes, and did not show the splash aspect, which visually improves the classification result.","Data mining; Decision tree; GeoDMA",,"Prudente, V.H.R.; UNIOESTEBrazil; email: victor.rohden@yahoo.com",,"Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola",01006916,,,,"English","Eng.

The ore is extracted, crushed and dried before calcination. Rotary kilns are usually about 100 m long and rotate to facilitate material flow. Due to this length, in addition to rotation speed, the material takes a variable time to cross the whole kiln, and thereby changing the chemical and temperature profile, making the control of calcine temperature a great challenge. However, statistical analysis are a great tool for finding interesting patterns that are of valuable help to control the kiln variables, that are very sensitive to inertia caused by rotation and changes in temperature profile. We present a study based on real data taken from a processing plant, whereby we applied data mining techniques to extract information on which variables have influence on kiln’s key performance index variables, such as calcine temperature. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2017.","Applied statistics; Chemical process; Rotary kiln control","Brickmaking; Calcination; Data mining; Electric furnaces; Ferroalloys; Rotary kilns; Statistical methods; Temperature control; Applied statistics; Chemical process; Extract informations; Key performance index; Kiln control; Processing plants; Rotation speed; Temperature profiles; Process control","Soares, F.M.; Federal University of ParáBrazil; email: fabiosoares22@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",23671181,,,,"English","Miner.

Due to this, data mining approaches have been applied for extracting useful knowledge from this big data. In order to deal with the increasing size of datasets, techniques for instance selection have been applied for reducing the data to a manageable volume and, consequently, to reduce the computational resources that are necessary to apply data mining approaches. However, most of the proposed approaches for instance selection have a high time complexity and, due to this, they cannot be applied for dealing with big data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for instance selection called XLDIS. This approach adopts the notion of local density for selecting the most representative instances of each class of the dataset, providing a reasonably low time complexity. The approach was evaluated on 20 well-known datasets used in a classification task, and its performance was compared to those of 6 state-of-the-art algorithms, considering three measures: accuracy, reduction, and effectiveness. All the obtained results show that, in general, the XLDIS algorithm provides the best trade-off between accuracy and reduction. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Big data; Data mining; Data reduction; Instance selection; Machine learning","Big data; Classification (of information); Data reduction; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Classification tasks; Computational resources; Instance selection; Local density; State-of-the-art algorithms; Time complexity; Trade off; Data mining","Carbonera, J.L.; IBM ResearchBrazil; email: joelc@br.ibm.com","Bellatreche L.Chakravarthy S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319642826,,,"English","Lect.

However, this phase is time consuming and expensive, a consequence of the huge amount of unstructured input information. In a previous research, we presented an approach for identifying business process elements in natural language texts which facilitate the modeler’s work. Such approach relies on a set of mapping rules associated with natural language processing techniques. The identification itself was already validated, but how to apply this information to minimize the modelers’ effort remains unclear. Highlighting the identified rules in the text can enhance its comprehensibility. This paper explores the applicability of such mapping rules on supporting the modeler by marked up texts. The validation shows promising results, as the time spent and effort perceived by the modeler were both minimized. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Business process management; Business process model and notation; Natural language processing; Process element; Process modeling; Process models","Administrative data processing; Big data; Data mining; Enterprise resource management; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Process engineering; Business process management; Business process model; Process elements; Process model; Process Modeling; Modeling languages","Thom, L.H.; Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

Reuse in ontologies allows speeding up the development process and improves the quality of the resulting ontologies. The use of patterns as an approach to encourage reuse has been explored in Ontology Engineering. An Ontology Pattern (OP) captures a solution for a recurring modeling problem. Very closely related OPs can be arranged in an Ontology Pattern Language (OPL). An OPL establishes relationships between the patterns and provides a process guiding the selection and use of them for systematic problem solving. To make it easier using an OPL, the relationships between the patterns and the process for navigating them should be represented in a clear and unambiguous way. A visual notation can be used to provide a visual representation of an OPL, aiming at improving communication. To facilitate understanding an OPL and strengthen its use, this visual notation must be cognitively rich.

However, anti-bullying programs should not focus on labeling children as either bullies or victims since they could produce opposite effects. Thus, an approach to deal with bullying episodes, without labeling children, is to determine their severity, so that school staff may respond to them appropriately. Related work about computational techniques to fight against bullying showed promising results but they offer categorical information as a set of labels. This work proposes a framework to determine bullying severity in texts, composed by two parts: (1) evaluation of texts using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers found in the literature, and (2) development of a Fuzzy Logic System that uses the outputs of SVM classifiers as its inputs to identify the bullying severity. Results show that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of SVM classifiers to determine the bullying severity through Fuzzy Logic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Bullying; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Data mining; Education; Learning systems; Soft computing; Support vector machines; Bullying; Computational technique; Fuzzy logic system; On-machines; Related works; SVM classifiers; Text mining; Fuzzy logic","Sedano, C.R.; University of Campinas, School of TechnologyBrazil; email: c154133@g.unicamp.br","Tadeusiewicz R.Zurada J.M.Zadeh L.A.Rutkowski L.Korytkowski M.Scherer R.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319590622,,,"English","Lect.

SCADAs are extremely important for the safety and security operation of modern power system and provide essential online information about the power system state to system operators. A current research challenge is to efficiently process this big data, which involves real-Time measurements of hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous electrical power system physical measurements. Among the foreseen automation tasks, outlier detection is one of the most important data mining techniques for power systems. However, like others data mining techniques, traditional outlier detection fails when dealing with problems in which the volume and dimensionality of data are as high as the ones observed in a SCADA. This work aims at circumventing these restrictions by presenting a methodology for dealing with SCADA big data that consists of a pre-processing algorithm and hybrid approach outlier detectors. The hybrid approach is assessed using real data from a Brazilian utility company. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying outliers correlated with important events that affect the system. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","electric power systems; high dimensionality; massive datasets; Outlier Detection; SCADA","Data acquisition; Data handling; Data mining; Electric power systems; SCADA systems; Statistics; Electrical power system; High dimensionality; Massive data sets; Outlier Detection; Pre-processing algorithms; Real time measurements; SCADA; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Big data","Alves, W.; Federal University of Pará (UFPA)Brazil; email: wesinec@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15480992,,,,"Portuguese","IEEE.

Although the sentiment analysis uses such data to develop useful applications in people's daily lives, there are still failures in this type of analysis, either by the restricted number of words contained in the word dictionaries or because they do not consider the most diverse parameters that can influence the sentiments in a sentence; thus, more reliable results can be obtained, if the users profile information and their writing characteristics are considered. This research suggests that one of the most relevant parameter contained in the user profile is the age group, showing that there are typical behaviors among users of the same age group, specifically, when these users write about the same topic. A detailed analysis with 7000 sentences was performed to determine which characteristics are relevant, such as, the use of punctuation, number of characters, media sharing, topics, among others; and which ones can be disregarded for the age groups classification. Different learning machine algorithms are tested for the classification of the teenager and adult age group, and the deep convolutional neural network had the best performance, reaching a precision of 0.95 in the validation tests. Furthermore, in order to validate the usefulness of the proposed model for classifying age groups, it is implemented into the enhanced sentiment metric (eSM). In the performance validation, subjective tests are performed and the eSM with the proposed model reached a root mean square error and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.25 and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the eSM metric, when the age group information is not available. © 2017 IEEE.","artificial neural networks; deep networ; machine learning; sentiment analysis; Social network services; text analysis","Correlation methods; Data mining; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Deep convolutional neural networks; deep networ; Learning machines; Pearson correlation coefficients; Performance validation; Root mean square errors; Social network services; Text analysis; Deep neural networks","Guimarães, R.G.; Federal University of LavrasBrazil; email: rgg.rita@posgrad.u_a.br",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028381978

This new domain of application presents challenges as well as opportunities for research in opinion mining. Nevertheless, the literature is still scarce of methods to extract multiple relevant aspects present in drug reviews. In this paper we propose a method to extract and classify aspects in drug reviews. The proposed solution has two main steps. In the aspect extraction, a method based on syntactic dependency paths is proposed to extract opinion pairs in drug reviews, composed by an aspect term associated to a sentiment modifier. In the aspect classification, a supervised classification is proposed based on domain and linguistics resources to classify the opinion pairs by aspect type (e.g., condition, adverse reaction, dosage and effectiveness). In order to evaluate the proposed method we conducted experiments with datasets related to three different diseases: ADHD, AIDS and Anxiety. Promising results were obtained in the experiments and various issues were identified and discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Aspect classification; Aspect extraction; Drugs reviews; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Opinion mining","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Patient monitoring; Supervised learning; Opinion mining; Supervised classification; Syntactic dependencies; Data mining","Cavalcanti, D.; Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de PernambucoBrazil; email: dcc2@cin.ufpe.br","Vale Z.Oliveira E.Gama J.Lopes Cardoso H.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319653396,,,"English","Lect.

In this context, tax fraud detection constitutes a challenging problem, since fraudsters change frequently their behaviors to circumvent existing laws and devise new kinds of frauds. Detecting such changes proves to be challenging, since traditional classifiers fail to select features that exhibit frequent variations. In this paper we provide two contributions that try to tackle effectively the tax fraud detection problem: first, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm, based on complex network techniques, that is able to capture key fraud indicators - over time, this kind of indicators turn out to be more stable than new fraud indicators. Secondly, we propose a classifier that leverages the aforementioned algorithm to accurately detect tax frauds. In order to prove the validity of our contributions we provide an experimental evaluation, where we use real-world datasets, obtained from the State Treasury Office of Ceará (SEFAZ-CE), Brazil, to show how our method is able to outperform, in terms of F1 scores achieved, the state-of-the-art available in the literature.

Information flows among organizational entities, sectors, areas and employees represent possible risks of low process interoperability as well as of non-compliance between business rules and actual process deliveries. In addition to this complexity, the Brazilian healthcare area has well-known problems in its public and private health care systems. These problems are of structural, organizational and financial natures, reflecting the low value attributed to quality and to the actual services provided evidenced in recent surveys of Instituto Data Folha and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Ministério da Saúde). The extraction of process data logs, and the use of process mining, enables extraction of qualitative and quantitative indicators for hospital processes. On top of these, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools can be used for analysis and decision making in support to process diagnosis. This paper aims to propose the joint use of process data mining and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in analysing and identifying organizational performance levels in a particular hospital process.

In the past, we have explored theoretical foundations for multi-level conceptual modeling and proposed an axiomatic theory for multi-level modeling dubbed MLT. MLT provides concepts for multi-level modeling along with a number of rules to guide the construction of sound multi-level conceptual models. Despite the benefits of MLT, it is still unable to deal with a number of general notions underlying conceptual models (including the notions used in its own definition). In this paper, we present an extension of MLT to deal with these limitations. The resulting theory (called MLT*) is novel in that it combines a strictly stratified theory of levels with the flexibility required to model abstract notions that defy stratification into levels such as a universal “Type” or, even more abstract notions such as “Entity” and “Thing”. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conceptual modeling; Metamodeling; Multi-level modeling","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Abstract notions; Axiomatic theory; Classification scheme; Conceptual model; Formal theory; Metamodeling; Multilevel model; Theoretical foundations; Data mining","Almeida, J.P.A.; Ontology and Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO), Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)Brazil; email: jpalmeida@ieee.org","Pastor O.Mayr H.C.Guizzardi G.Ma H.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319699035,,,"English","Lect.

Its symptoms are often related to difficulty in remembering new information and include impaired judgment, disorientation, confusion, behavioral changes and difficulty in speaking and walking. Clinical Decision Support Systems can be designed to improve clinical decision-making by making the physician aware of the most probable diagnosis given the patient health records, and then reducing AD diagnostic error rates. This work extends a previous discrete Bayesian decision model for supporting diagnosis of AD and related disorders and proposes improvements in this model following two approaches: mixing continuous and discrete nodes by implementing a Hybrid Logistic Regression-Naïve Bayes model and relaxing independence assumptions by adopting the AnDE (Averaged n-Dependence Estimators) model. Our proposal presents better performance results. The 4-fold cross-validation results on CAD (Center for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders) patient dataset showed that the A2DE classifier (AnDE with n = 2) outperforms the previous discrete Bayesian network for AD considering all proposed measures: Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUC), F1-score, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Cross-Entropy (MXE). Also, the Hybrid Logistic Regression-Naïve Bayes model outperforms the previous discrete Bayesian network for dementia considering MSE and, for AD, considering AUC and MSE. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Alzheimer’s disease; Bayesian decision model; Clinical decision support systems; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Cognitive systems; Data mining; Decision support systems; Education; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pattern recognition; Regression analysis; Sodium; Alzheimer; Bayesian decision; Clinical decision support systems; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairments; Diagnosis","Carvalho, C.M.; Institute of Computing, Fluminense Federal University, Rua Passo da Pátria, 156, Brazil; email: carolmc@midiacom.uff.br","Perner P.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319624150,,,"English","Lect.

Genetic architecture studies are important for identifying genomic regions associated with traits of interest. However, due to the genetic complexity of sugarcane, the practical applications of genomic tools have been notably delayed in this crop, in contrast to other crops that have already advanced to marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection. High-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened new opportunities for discovering molecular markers, especially single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion-deletion (indels), at the genome-wide level. The objectives of this study were to (i) establish a pipeline for identifying variants from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data in sugarcane, (ii) construct an integrated genetic map with GBS-based markers plus target region amplification polymorphisms and microsatellites, (iii) detect QTLs related to yield component traits, and (iv) perform annotation of the sequences that originated the associated markers with mapped QTLs to search putative candidate genes. Results: We used four pseudo-references to align the GBS reads. Depending on the reference, from 3,433 to 15,906 high-quality markers were discovered, and half of them segregated as single-dose markers (SDMs) on average. In addition to 7,049 non-redundant SDMs from GBS, 629 gel-based markers were used in a subsequent linkage analysis. Of 7,678 SDMs, 993 were mapped. These markers were distributed throughout 223 linkage groups, which were clustered in 18 homo(eo)logous groups (HGs), with a cumulative map length of 3,682.04 cM and an average marker density of 3.70 cM. We performed QTL mapping of four traits and found seven QTLs. Our results suggest the presence of a stable QTL across locations. Furthermore, QTLs to soluble solid content (BRIX) and fiber content (FIB) traits had markers linked to putative candidate genes. Conclusions: This study is the first to report the use of GBS for large-scale variant discovery and genotyping of a mapping population in sugarcane, providing several insights regarding the use of NGS data in a polyploid, non-model species. The use of GBS generated a large number of markers and still enabled ploidy and allelic dosage estimation. Moreover, we were able to identify seven QTLs, two of which had great potential for validation and future use for molecular breeding in sugarcane. © The Author(s). 2017.","Allelic dosage; Molecular markers; Polyploidy; Quantitative traits; Saccharum spp; SNPs","Article; gene amplification; gene cluster; gene dosage; gene mining; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic marker; genetic procedures; genetic trait; genetic variability; genotype; genotyping by sequencing; indel mutation; microsatellite marker; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; plant genome; plant yield; polyploidy; promoter region; quantitative trait locus mapping; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; single dosage marker; single nucleotide polymorphism; sugarcane; validation study; allele; chromosomal mapping; data mining; DNA sequence; genetic marker; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genotyping technique; growth, development and aging; molecular genetics; plant gene; procedures; quantitative trait locus; sugarcane; Alleles; Chromosome Mapping; Data Mining; Gene Dosage; Genes, Plant; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Markers; Genotyping Techniques; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Polymorphism, Genetic; Quantitative Trait Loci; Saccharum; Sequence Analysis, DNA","Carneiro, M.S.; Departamento de Biotecnologia e Produção Vegetal e Animal, Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Rodovia Anhanguera, Km 174, Brazil; email: monalisa@cca.ufscar.br",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712164,,BGMEE,"28077090","English","BMC Genomics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009771911

In recent years, advances made in thrombosis research disclosed a functional link between activated neutrophils, monocytes, and platelet-driven thrombogenesis. Forging a physical barrier, the fibrin scaffolds generated by synergism between the extrinsic and intrinsic (contact) pathways of coagulation entrap microbes within microvessels, limiting the systemic spread of infection while enhancing the clearance of pathogens by activated leukocytes. Insight from mice models of thrombosis linked fibrin formation via the intrinsic pathway to the autoactivation of factor XII (FXII) by negatively charged “contact” substances, such as platelet-derived polyphosphates and DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps. Following cleavage by FXIIa, activated plasma kallikrein (PK) initiates inflammation by liberating the nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) from an internal domain of high molecular weight kininogen (HK). Acting as a paracrine mediator, BK induces vasodilation and increases microvascular permeability via activation of endothelial B2R, a constitutively expressed subtype of kinin receptor. During infection, neutrophil-driven extravasation of plasma fuels inflammation via extravascular activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Whether liberated by plasma-borne PK, tissue kallikrein, and/or microbial-derived proteases, the short-lived kinins activate immature dendritic cells via B2R, thus linking the infection-associated innate immunity/inflammation to the adaptive arm of immunity. As inflammation persists, a GPI-linked carboxypeptidase M removes the C-terminal arginine from the primary kinin, converting the B2R agonist into a high-affinity ligand for B1R, a GPCR subtype that is transcriptionally upregulated in injured/inflamed tissues. As reviewed here, lessons taken from studies of kinin receptor function in experimental infections have shed light on the complex proteolytic circuits that, acting at the endothelial interface, reciprocally couple immunity to the proinflammatory KKS. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bradykinin; Contact system of coagulation; Infection; Inflammation; Innate and adaptive immunity; Kallikrein-kinin system; Kinin receptors; Parasitic diseases; Proteases; Viral infection","bradykinin B1 receptor; bradykinin B2 receptor; G protein coupled receptor; kallikrein; kinin; metalloproteinase; bradykinin; G protein coupled receptor; high molecular weight kininogen; kallikrein; allergy; bacterial immunity; bacterial infection; blood clotting; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell maturation; cell migration; Chagas disease; data mining; dendritic cell; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; human; immunity; inflammation; kallikrein kinin system; leishmaniasis; macrophage; mast cell; neutrophil; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein secretion; signal transduction; Sindbis virus; Th1 cell; Trypanosoma cruzi; virus immunity; virus infection; visceral leishmaniasis; animal; cell membrane permeability; immunity; immunology; metabolism; mouse; protein degradation; thrombocyte; vascular endothelium; vasodilatation; Animals; Blood Coagulation; Blood Platelets; Bradykinin; Cell Membrane Permeability; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Immunity; Kallikrein-Kinin System; Kallikreins; Kininogen, High-Molecular-Weight; Mice; Proteolysis; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Vasodilation","Scharfstein, J.; Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Center of Health Sciences (CCS), Cidade UniversitáriaBrazil; email: jscharf2@gmail.com",,"Academic Press Inc.",00652776,,ADIMA,"28950949","English","Adv.

In this paper, we identify spatial patterns of collaboration in Brazil and measure the role of geographic proximity in determining the interaction among researchers. Using a database comprising more than one million researchers and seven million publications, we consolidated information on interregional research collaboration in terms of scientific coauthorship networks among 4,615 municipalities during the period between 1992 and 2009, which allowed us to analyze a range of data unprecedented in the literature. The effects of geographic distance on collaboration were measured for different areas by estimating spatial interaction models. The main results provide strong evidence of geographic deconcentration of collaboration in recent years, with increased participation of authors in scientifically less traditional regions, such as south and northeast Brazil. Distance remains a significant factor in determining the intensity of knowledge flow in collaboration networks in Brazil, as an increase of 100 km between two researchers reduces the probability of collaboration by an average of 16%, and there is no evidence that the effect of distance has diminished over time, although the magnitude of such effects varies among networks of different areas. © 2016 ASIS&T","knowledge discovery; scientometrics","Co-authorship networks; Collaboration network; Geographic proximity; nocv1; Northeast Brazil; Research collaborations; Scholarly publication; Scientometrics; Spatial interaction model; Data mining; Brazil; data base; geography; human; knowledge discovery; model; probability; publication; scientist",,,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",23301635,,,,"English","J.

One of the most important task for the success of a meta-learning system is gathering data about the learning process. This data is used to induce a (meta) model able to map characteristics extracted from different data sets to the performance of learning algorithms on these data sets. These systems are built under the assumption that the data are generated by a stationary distribution, i.e., a learning algorithm will perform similarly for new data from the same problem. However, many applications generate data whose characteristics can change over time. Therefore, a suitable bias at a given time may become inappropriate at another time. Although meta-learning has been used to continuously select a learning algorithm in data streams, data characterization has received less attention in this context. In this study, we provide a set of guidelines to support the proposal of characteristics able to describe non-stationary data over time. This guidance considers both the order of arrival of the examples and the type of variables involved in the base-level learning. In addition, we analyze the influence of characteristics regarding their dependence on data morphology. Experimental results using real data streams showed the effectiveness of the proposed data characterization general scheme to support algorithm selection by meta-learning systems. Moreover, the dependent meta-features provided crucial information for the success of some meta-models. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Among several strategies to obtain the correct shape of a missing bone part, we explore a modelling method based on geometric features defined by Bezier cubic curves. The data is obtained from sets of slices of tomographic scans as a reference. From the images, we know about data from the edges in the image but we do not have any information about a missing area in a specific bone region. Thus, the objective is to search patterns for features whose values are known from similar tomographic image which matches to fill a hole in a bone. Due the free form of a bone there are a lot of parameters to be evaluated. Thus, a Data Mining approach is applied for classification and to discover the best features as shape descriptors.

They can be found in many spatial datasets as in seismic, astronomy, and transportation. A particular interesting geometric pattern is exhibited by the Einstein cross, which is an astronomical phenomenon in which a single quasar is observed as four distinct sky objects when captured by earth telescopes. Finding such crosses, as well as other geometric patterns, collectively refered to as constellation queries, is a challenging problem as the potential number of sets of elements that compose shapes is exponentially large in the size of the dataset and the query pattern. In this paper we propose algorithms to optimize the computation of constellation queries. Our techniques involve pre-processing the query to reduce its dimensionality as well as indexing the data to fasten stars neighboring computation using a PH-tree. We have implemented our techniques in Spark and evaluated our techniques by a series of experiments. The PH-tree indexing showed very good results and guarantees query answer completeness. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Constellation queries; Dataset pre-processing; Geometric shapes; PH-tree indexing; Query pre-processing; SQL extension","Data mining; Earth (planet); Forestry; Geometry; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Query processing; Trees (mathematics); Constellation queries; Geometric shape; Pre-processing; SQL extension; Tree indexing; Big data","Khatibi, A.; DEXL Lab, LNCCBrazil; email: ahassan@lncc.br","Bellatreche L.Chakravarthy S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319642826,,,"English","Lect.

We propose VOLTIME, a generative model that fits well the inter-arrival time distribution (IAT) of real users. Thus, VOLTIME automatically spots and ranks suspicious users. Experiments on several real datasets, ranging from Reddit comments and phone calls to Flipkart product reviews, show that VOLTIME is able to accurately fit the activity volume and IAT of real data. Additionally, we show that VOLTIME ranks suspicious users with a precision higher than 90% for a sensitivity of 70%.

The aim of the present study was to predict soil units in a watershed with wide variation in landscape conditions. The approach relied on a modelling of soil-forming factors in order to understand the variability of the landscape components in the region. Models were generated for landscape attributes related to pedogenesis, specifically elevation, slope, curvature, compound topographic index, Euclidean distance from stream networks, landforms map, clay minerals index, iron oxide index and normalised difference vegetation index, along with an existing geology map. The soil classification was adapted from the World Reference Base System for Soil Resources, and the predominant soil taxonomic orders observed were Ferrasols, Acrisols, Gleysols, Cambisols, Fluvisols and Regosols. The algorithms used to predict the soil units were based on decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) methods. The criteria used to evaluate the models' performance were statistical indices, coherence between predicted units and the legacy map, as well as accuracy checks based on control samples. The best performing model was found to be the RF algorithm, with resulting statistical indices considered excellent (overall≤0.966, kappa≤0.962). The accuracy of the map as determined by control points was 67.89%, with a kappa value of 61.39%. © CSIRO 2017.","digital soil mapping; landscape modelling; pedology; soil classification; soil landscape.","Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Iron oxides; Soil surveys; Statistical mechanics; Statistical methods; Vegetation; Compound topographic indices; Digital soil mappings; Landscape attributes; Landscape modelling; Normalised difference vegetation index; pedology; Soil classification; Soil-landscape models; Soils; algorithm; digital mapping; iron oxide; landscape change; pedogenesis; pedology; soil classification; soil type; thematic mapping; watershed","Pinheiro, H.S.K.; Agronomy Institute - Soil Department, Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro, Rodovia BR 465, Brazil; email: lenask@gmail.com",,"CSIRO",1838675X,,,,"English","Soil Res.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034946919

An example of stored data is the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is of high importance to the various diseases that affect the brain. These data are stored to keep the patient’s clinical history and to help medical experts in performing future procedures, such as pattern discovery from specific diseases. However, the increase in medical data storage makes unfeasible their manual analysis. Also, the EEG can contain patterns difficult to be observed by naked eye. In this work, a cross-correlation technique was applied for feature extraction of a set of 200 EEG segments. Afterwards, predictive models were built using machine learning algorithms such as J48, 1NN, and BP-MLP (backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron), that implement decision tree, nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network, respectively. The models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and contingency table methods. The evaluation results showed that the model built with the J48 performed better and was more likely to correctly classify EEG segments in this study than 1NN and BP-MLP, corresponding to 98.50% accuracy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Classification; Cross-correlation; EEG; Machine learning; Predictive models","Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Big data; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Digital storage; Electroencephalography; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; 10-fold cross-validation; Clinical examination; Cross correlation techniques; Cross correlations; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Large amounts of data; Machine learning techniques; Predictive models; Data mining","Oliva, J.T.; Bioinspired Computing Laboratory, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of São PauloBrazil; email: jeffersonoliva@usp.br","Holzinger A.Goebel R.Ferri M.Palade V.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319697741,,,"English","Lect.

Deterministic linkage methods rely on the presence of common uniquely identifying attributes across all sources while probabilistic approaches use non-unique attributes and calculates similarity indexes for pair wise comparisons. A key component of record linkage is accuracy assessment — the process of manually verifying and validating matched pairs to further refine linkage parameters and increase its overall effectiveness. This process however is time-consuming and impractical when applied to large administrative data sources where millions of records must be linked. Additionally, it is potentially biased as the gold standard used is often the reviewer’s intuition. In this paper, we present an approach for assessing and refining the accuracy of probabilistic linkage based on different supervised machine learning methods (decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, linear support vector machines and gradient boosted trees). We used data sets extracted from huge Brazilian socioeconomic and public health care data sources. These models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic plots, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values collected from a 10-fold cross-validation method. Results show that logistic regression outperforms other classifiers and enables the creation of a generalized, very accurate model to validate linkage results. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Supervised learning; 10-fold cross-validation; Linear Support Vector Machines; Multiple heterogeneous data source; Overall effectiveness; Positive predictive values; Probabilistic approaches; Receiver operating characteristics; Supervised machine learning; Big data","Pita, R.; Computer Science Department, Federal University of Bahia (UFBA)Brazil; email: pierre.pita@gmail.com","Bellatreche L.Chakravarthy S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319642826,,,"English","Lect.

Matrix reordering algorithms try to provide a permuted version of these matrices, such that hidden patterns become visible for users. However, most of them fail on revealing Circumplex pattern, due to high execution time or to low quality of output matrix. In order to overcome this difficulty, we present a matrix reordering method (Circumplex Sort), whose goal is to permute a matrix in order to reveal a Circumplex pattern. In a first phase, our method reorders input matrix rows according to the index-weighted means of the values of each column. After that, the method creates and concatenates two stacks of rows based on a same initial row; for each row obtained according to the row order of the first phase, the method pushes this row at the stack whose top is most similar to it. Circumplex Sort runs the same two phases for columns. Our experiments with synthetic matrices revealed that our approach produces high-quality results (in terms of evaluation functions and runtime) when this pattern is hidden in data matrix. Besides, we present a real world dataset that exemplifies the use of Circumplex Sort for revealing Circumplex pattern. © 2017.","Circumplex data pattern; Heatmap; Reorderable matrices; Reordering algorithms; Seriation","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer graphics; Computer vision; Data mining; Data visualization; Image processing; Visualization; Column permutations; Data patterns; Evaluation function; Heatmap; Hidden patterns; Matrix reordering; Seriation; Two phase method; Matrix algebra",,"Rodrigues L.Xiao Y.Abraham A.P.","IADIS",,9789898533661,,,"English","Proc.

Clear thinking is impossible! Ceiling lights flash by as you are rushed to the emergency department (ED). You feel your body is getting even sicker. Doctors are doing their utmost to treat this acute and threatening condition, while they work piece together all small parts of evidence to set the diagnosis and start targeted treatment. In this situation, the clinical staff depends on a clinical pathway protocol to streamline communication and deliver care according to the latest medical evidence. Today, such clinical pathways are mainly executed and tracked using paper. Hence, there is ample opportunity for technology in a supportive role. Automated process analysis can help improve these processes of delivering standardized care beyond their current level.

Several attempts to derive production models by data mining and machine learning techniques have been reported recently. A more classical approach is to develop a discrete simulation model and explore various control scenarios in simulation setting. Another line of research explores the usability of analytical models in combination with standard control design techniques. More specifically, an application of bond graph modelling to a multi-product manufacturing system is reported in the literature. During the modelling process the discrete production dynamics is ""fluidised"" and analytical model is derived in matrix form. This paper extends the previous work in the sense that analytical model is used to tune the PI production controller and, for verification purposes, the discrete event simulation is applied, which renders a more realistic representation of discrete production dynamics. Among others, various disturbances in the planned production and their effect on the performance of the developed control strategy are more easily evaluated this way.","Manufacturing systems; Modelling; Production control; Simulation","Data mining; Design; Discrete event simulation; Fluidization; Graph theory; Learning systems; Manufacture; Models; Production control; Bond graph modelling; Classical approach; Discrete production; Discrete simulation model; Machine learning techniques; Model based approach; Production control strategies; Simulation; Analytical models",,"Longo F.Affenzeller M.Piera M.A.Bruzzone A.G.Jimenez E.","CAL-TEK S.r.l.",,9781510847651,,,"English","Eur.

In the healthcare area, flexibility is essential to provide a quality treatment because, even patients with the same diagnostic, may follow different paths and suffer different proceedings. Besides, there are many aspects to be considered for the selection of a path, as patient’s symptoms, and clinical guidelines, among others. In this context, this research presents a framework for the management of the process variants through semantic reasoning. The enrichment of the business process with semantics enables the automation of the configuration, thus promoting more flexible and adaptive solutions.

For this reason, process discovery techniques often deliver models less understandable and useful than expected. In order to address this issue, we propose a method based on statistical inference for pre-processing event logs. We measure the distance between different segments of the event log, computing the probability distribution of observing activities in specific positions. Because segments are generated based on time-domain, business rules or business management system properties, we get a characterisation of these segments in terms of both business and process aspects. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach by developing a case study with real-life event logs and showing that our method is offering interesting properties in term of computational complexity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Event-log clustering; Lightweight trace profiling; Pre-processing; Process mining","Administrative data processing; Data mining; Enterprise resource management; Management science; Probability distributions; Processing; Business management systems; Event-log clustering; Lightweight trace profiling; Pre-processing; Pre-processing method; Process Discovery; Process mining; Statistical inference; Time domain analysis","Barbon, S.; Londrina State University, Rod.

Hence, if we find physicians that share patients with each other probably they configure an informal care team. Thus, the objective of this work is to explore the possibility of finding care teams using Social Network Analysis techniques in physician-physician networks where the physicians have patients in common. For this, we used healthcare insurance claims to build the network. There was the agreement on the metrics of degree and eigenvalue and of betweenness and closeness, also physicians with the 5 highest eigenvalues are highly interconnected. We discuss that the analysis of the physician-physician network with metrics of centrality is promising to reveal informal care teams. The high potential in calculating these metrics is verified from the results to evaluate member's performance and with that how to take actions to improve the work of the team. © 2017 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.","Data mining; Patient care team; Quality of life","adult; data mining; human; insurance; intimacy; patient care; physician; quality of life; social network; health care delivery; health insurance; patient care; social support; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Insurance, Health; Patient Care; Patient Care Team; Physicians; Social Support","Ito, M.; IBM Research, Rua Tutóia, 1157, Brazil; email: marciaito@br.ibm.com","Dongsheng Z.Gundlapalli A.V.Marie-Christine J.","IOS Press",09269630,9781614998297,,"29295127","English","Stud.

In this context, the use of indicators for the evaluation of scientific and technological activities has been widely adopted to characterize and measure its volume and to identify its main actors and investments. We choose as our focus Institutes of Science, Technology and Innovation (ISTIs). ISTIs are important actors, they work in the ""valley of death of innovation"", a region with the greatest risks and requirements of investments and needs about the real-time indicators for the evaluation of technological activity. Despite the large volume of information available, there is a perceived lack of applicability of these data for real time decision making. In this paper, we outline our initial work in establishing dynamic Indicators for the Evaluation of Technological Activity (IETAs) and their potential use in real-time decision making, available and accessible via the internet. We will focus on two approaches that involve bibliometric and altmetric data. The first approach is concerned with identifying signs of interest in certain clearly recognized technologies. The second approach is concerned with identifying the terms and phrases that characterize of given technology. Both approaches are going to explore the possibilities offered by the data related to the Web of Science (WoS) and its use as Knowledge Base to apply information retrieval and text mining techniques to unstructured data from technology and other types of relevant reports and only those available and accessible through the internet. © 2017.","Bibliometric; Evaluation of Technological Activity; Real Time Indicators; Scientometrics; Technological Indicators","Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Bibliometric; Dynamic indicators; Identifying signs; Real time; Real time decision-making; Scientometrics; Technological activity; Text mining techniques; Data mining",,"Weghorn H.Isaias P.Rodrigues L.","IADIS Press",,9789898533692,,,"English","Proc.

However, most of the current scientific workflow management systems do not handle the memory and data locality appropriately. Apache Spark deals with these issues by chaining activities that should be executed in a specific node, among other optimizations such as the in-memory storage of intermediate data in RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). However, to take advantage of the RDDs, Spark requires existing workflows to be described using its own API, which forces the activities to be reimplemented in Python, Java, Scala or R, and this demands a big effort from the workflow programmers. In this paper, we propose a parallel scientific workflow engine called TARDIS, whose objective is to run existing workflows inside a Spark cluster, using RDDs and smart caching, in a completely transparent way for the user, i.e., without needing to reimplement the workflows in the Spark API. We evaluated our system through experiments and compared its performance with Swift/K. The results show that TARDIS performs better (up to 138% improvement) than Swift/K for parallel scientific workflow execution. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Data mining; Digital storage; Information management; Work simplification; Memory storage; Parallel executions; Scientific applications; Scientific data; Scientific workflow engines; Scientific workflow managements; Scientific workflows; Shared nothing; Big data","Gaspar, D.; LNCC - National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Av.

Major accidents, however, can deeply affect the continuity of operations, and many of the findings arising from recent investigation reports relate to poor managerial decisions, triggering operational sequences which result in undesirable outcomes. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyse first-line management decisions, in order to reveal common patterns affecting human factors and improve decision-making processes. Management decisions from the worst accident occurred in offshore Brazilian waters in the past fifteen years are scrutinised, using the publicly-available investigation report from the regulatory bodies as basis. Then, a data mining approach will be applied to a major-accident dataset, and analogous tendencies are revealed and compared with the case study. Problems arising from human factors associated with the lack of managerial rules and principles are investigated, and implications to improve decision-making processes are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Accidents; Data mining; Human engineering; Managers; Offshore oil well production; Reliability theory; Decision making process; Major accidents; Management decisions; Managerial decision; Operational sequence; Regulatory bodies; Decision making",,"Cepin M.Bris R.","CRC Press/Balkema",,9781138629370,,,"English","Saf.

In this paper, we discuss one particular kind of such tools, namely, ontological anti-patterns. Ontological anti-patterns are error-problem modeling structures that can create a deviation between the possible and the intended interpretations of a model. In this paper, we present two empirically elicited ontological anti-patterns related to the modeling of part-whole relations. In particular, these anti-patterns identify possible mistakes in the modeling of collectives (complex entities that have a uniform role-based structure) and functional complexes (complex entities composed of functional parts). Besides identifying these anti-patterns, the paper presents a series of rectification plans that can be used to eliminate their occurrence in models. Finally, we present a model-based computational tool that supports the automated detection, analysis and elimination of these anti-patterns. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Anti-patterns; Ontology-based conceptual modeling; Parthood","Cognitive systems; Computation theory; Computational methods; Data mining; Fleet operations; Information systems; Philosophical aspects; Anti-patterns; Automated detection; Cognitive science; Complex entities; Computational tools; Conceptual model; Functional parts; Parthood; Ontology","Guizzardi, G.; Faculty of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-BolzanoItaly; email: gguizzardi@unibz.it","Kirikova M.Norvag K.Papadopoulos G.A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319669168,,,"English","Lect.
