The use of dimensionality reduction methods is therefore an impor­tant alternative; however, these methods do not deal with the reduction of attributes in a specific area. This article presents a method based on framework concepts of domain for reducing attributes in a domain. The input method is a set of databases related to a domain, and the main process is the identification of common and variable attributes, plus the reduction of attributes in the original database. The proposed method was applied in the gene expression domain, using databases. The method can be used to analyze the most relevant attributes in a specific domain, granting greater confidence for models created for the application of a data mining task, thus, a previously known method in data mining. Attribute selection was also applied in the three databases for the comparison of the results. Analyses of the results using the cri­terion of cross-validation revealed that the employment of the methods resulted in the improvement of success rates compared to the databases containing the full range of attributes. © FUNPEC-RP.","Attribute selection; Dimensionality reduction; Framework","acute granulocytic leukemia; acute leukemia; Article; classification algorithm; conceptual framework; controlled study; data mining; gene expression; genetic algorithm; genetic database; human; information processing; large cell lymphoma; major clinical study; methodology; protein domain; support vector machine; algorithm; data mining; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; procedures; Algorithms; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Macedo, D.C.; Departamento de Engenharia de Produção, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do ParanáBrazil",,"Fundacao de Pesquisas Cientificas de Ribeirao Preto",16765680,,,"25511043","English","Genet.

This allows us to use well-known sequence alignment algorithms for dealing with this task. Moreover, our approach uses a domain ontology for representing the knowledge about the domain objects. This ensures an agreement regarding the formal vocabulary used for describing the geological objects, allowing us to deal with the data collected by different geologists in a homogeneous way. Finally, we also use clustering techniques for finding groups of geological objects that are sufficiently similar for being correlated by the sequence alignment algorithms.

However, most of the proposed approaches are designed for dealing only with numeric data. In this paper, our focus is on soft subspace clustering for categorical data. In soft subspace clustering, the attribute weighting approach plays a crucial role. Due to this, we propose an entropy-based approach for measuring the relevance of each categorical attribute in each cluster. Besides that, we propose the EBK-modes (entropy-based k-modes), an extension of the basic k-modes that uses our approach for attribute weighting. We performed experiments on five real-world datasets, comparing the performance of our algorithms with four state-of-the-art algorithms, using three well-known evaluation metrics: accuracy, f-measure and adjusted Rand index. According to the experiments, the EBK-modes outperforms the algorithms that were considered in the evaluation, regarding the considered metrics. © 2014 IEEE.","attribute weighting; categorical data; clustering; data mining; entropy; subspace clustering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Entropy; Attribute weighting; Categorical attributes; Categorical data; clustering; Entropy based approach; Real-world datasets; State-of-the-art algorithms; Sub-Space Clustering; Clustering algorithms",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10823409,9781479965724,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

In 2012 about 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred globally. Because of many reasons like the severity of some cases, the side effects of some treatments and death of other patients, cancer patients tend to be affected by serious emotional disorders, like depression, for instance. Thus, monitoring the mood of the patients is an important part of their treatment. Many cancer patients are users of online social networks and many of them take part in cancer virtual communities where they exchange messages commenting about their treatment or giving support to other patients in the community. Most of these communities are of public access and thus are useful sources of information about the mood of patients. Based on that, Sentiment Analysis methods can be useful to automatically detect positive or negative mood of cancer patients by analyzing their messages in these online communities. Objective: The objective of this work is to present a Sentiment Analysis tool, named SentiHealth-Cancer (SHC-pt), that improves the detection of emotional state of patients in Brazilian online cancer communities, by inspecting their posts written in Portuguese language. The SHC-pt is a sentiment analysis tool which is tailored specifically to detect positive, negative or neutral messages of patients in online communities of cancer patients. We conducted a comparative study of the proposed method with a set of general-purpose sentiment analysis tools adapted to this context. Methods: Different collections of posts were obtained from two cancer communities in Facebook. Additionally, the posts were analyzed by sentiment analysis tools that support the Portuguese language (Semantria and SentiStrength) and by the tool SHC-pt, developed based on the method proposed in this paper called SentiHealth. Moreover, as a second alternative to analyze the texts in Portuguese, the collected texts were automatically translated into English, and submitted to sentiment analysis tools that do not support the Portuguese language (AlchemyAPI and Textalytics) and also to Semantria and SentiStrength, using the English option of these tools. Six experiments were conducted with some variations and different origins of the collected posts. The results were measured using the following metrics: precision, recall, F1-measure and accuracy. Results: The proposed tool SHC-pt reached the best averages for accuracy and F1-measure (harmonic mean between recall and precision) in the three sentiment classes addressed (positive, negative and neutral) in all experimental settings. Moreover, the worst accuracy value (58%) achieved by SHC-pt in any experiment is 11.53% better than the greatest accuracy (52%) presented by other addressed tools. Finally, the worst average F1 (48.46%) reached by SHC-pt in any experiment is 4.14% better than the greatest average F1 (46.53%) achieved by other addressed tools. Thus, even when we compare the SHC-pt results in complex scenario versus others in easier scenario the SHC-pt is better. Conclusions: This paper presents two contributions. First, it proposes the method SentiHealth to detect the mood of cancer patients that are also users of communities of patients in online social networks. Second, it presents an instantiated tool from the method, called SentiHealth-Cancer (SHC-pt), dedicated to automatically analyze posts in communities of cancer patients, based on SentiHealth. This context-tailored tool outperformed other general-purpose sentiment analysis tools at least in the cancer context. This suggests that the SentiHealth method could be instantiated as other disease-based tools during future works, for instance SentiHealth-HIV, SentiHealth-Stroke and SentiHealth-Sclerosis. © 2015.","Cancer; Facebook; Online social networks; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis","Complex networks; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Diseases; Online systems; Patient treatment; Virtual reality; Websites; Cancer; Facebook; On-line social networks; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); accuracy; Article; Brazil; cancer patient; cancer research; clinical assessment tool; comparative study; emotion; evaluation study; human; interpersonal communication; mood; online monitoring; outcome assessment; priority journal; sentihealth cancer; social network; affect; Internet; neoplasm; psychology; social support; Affect; Humans; Internet; Neoplasms; Social Support","Rodrigues, R.G.; Instituto de Informática, Universidade Federal de Goiás, PO Box 131, Brazil; email: ramongouveia@inf.ufg.br",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",13865056,,IJMIF,"26514078","English","Int.

Spam traffic, for example, accounts for terabytes of data daily. It becomes necessary to create tools that are able to process these data efficiently, in large volumes, in order to understand their characteristics. Although mail servers are able to receive and store messages as they arrive, applying complex algorithms to a large set of mailboxes, either for characterization, security reasons or for data mining goals is challenging. Big data processing environments such as Hadoop are useful for the analysis of large data sets, although originally designed to handle text files in general.

The quality control by evaluating the major chemical constituents under the influence of the most important factors, such as temperature and storage time of the product, is very important in this context. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and time on the degradation of fresh orange juice for 24 h, by using 1H NMR technique and chemometric tools for data mining. The storage conditions at 24 h led to the production of the formic, fumaric and acetic acids; and an increase of succinic and lactic acids and ethanol, which were observed at low concentration at the initial time. Furthermore, analysis by PCA has successfully distinguished the juice of different species/varieties as well as the metabolites responsible for their separation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The most successful strategy for inducing decision trees is the greedy top-down recursive approach, which has been continuously improved by researchers over the past 40 years. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift in the research of decision trees: instead of proposing a new manually designed method for inducing decision trees, we propose automatically designing decision-tree induction algorithms tailored to a specific type of classification data set (or application domain). Following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, we propose a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for designing decision-tree algorithms (HEAD-DT) that evolves design components of top-down decision-tree induction algorithms. By the end of the evolution, we expect HEAD-DT to generate a new and possibly better decision-tree algorithm for a given application domain. We perform extensive experiments in 35 real-world microarray gene expression data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and compare it with very well known decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Results show that HEAD-DT is capable of generating algorithms that significantly outperform the baseline manually designed decision-tree algorithms regarding predictive accuracy and F-measure. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","automatic algorithm design; classification; decision trees; evolutionary algorithms; hyperheuristics; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Design; Gene expression; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Trees (mathematics); Automatic algorithms; Decision-tree algorithm; Decision-tree induction; Evolutionary design; Hyper-heuristics; Machine learning applications; Microarray gene expression data; Predictive accuracy; Evolutionary algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1089778X,,ITEVF,,"English","IEEE Trans Evol Comput",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905681624

This pathogen is frequently associated with nosocomial outbreaks worldwide and has become particularly problematic because of its prevalence and resistance patterns to several antibiotics. In the present study, we used an immunoproteome-based approach to identify immunogenic proteins located on the surface of A. baumannii for the development of a possible immunotherapy against this devastating bacterial infection. Experimental design: Sera from patients with A. baumannii infections (n = 50) and from a control group of healthy individuals (n = 3) were analyzed for reactivity against A. baumannii outer membrane proteins (OMPs) using Western blot analysis. To identify potential immunogenic proteins in A. baumannii, OMPs were separated by 2DE, and reactive sera from infected patients were randomly selected and divided into two different pools, each containing 15 sera. Finally, MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometric analysis was employed to identify the corresponding proteins. Results: This analysis identified six immunoreactive proteins: OmpA, Omp34kDa, OprC, OprB-like, OXA-23, and ferric siderophore receptor protein.

Large mining corporations are responding by advancing the idea of a sustainable mining industry. These responses are accompanied by concerted efforts to advertise a company's relative progress in this direction through the publication of sustainability reports based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework. Many scholars contest the effectiveness of that framework, arguing that GRIbased reports can mislead decision-makers who are concerned with sustainability, or even camouflage unsustainable practices, particularly at the site level. Few scholars, however, have scratched below the surface of criticism in order to consider how to improve the effectiveness of that framework. This article takes a closer look at this problem by answering the following question: What needs to be changed in mining corporations' GRI-based frameworks for the purpose of promoting more meaningful and reliable sustainability performance information? This article followed a qualitative methodological approach based on literature reviews and 41 semi-structured interviews. The analysis was guided by an evaluation of the extent to which the predominant GRI-based approach to sustainability reporting meets a number of principles of sustainability assessment and reporting, known as the BellagioSTAMP principles. This paper outlines a number of specific changes that should be promoted in mining corporations' frameworks if their reports are to provide meaningful and accurate information about sustainability progress. Such changes include a more systematic consideration of site-level performance, scenario building, and legacy effects. Overall, this article corroborates the view that meaningful and reliable standardized disclosures of contributions to sustainability are unlikely to emerge any time soon. The geographical dispersion of mining facilities imposes substantial difficulties to the contextualization of sustainability evaluations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent decades visible near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIR) has been shown to be a viable alternative for rapidly analysing soil properties. We studied 7172 samples of seven different soil types collected from several regions of Brazil and varying in organic matter (OM) (0.2-10.3%) and clay content (0.2-99.0%). The aim was to explore the possibility of enhancing the performance of vis-NIR data in predicting organic matter and clay content in this library by dividing it into smaller sub-libraries on the basis of their vis-NIR spectra. We used partial least square regression (PLSR) models on the sub-libraries and compared the results with PLSR and two non-linear calibration techniques, boosted regression trees (BT) and support vector machines (SVM) applied to the whole library. The whole library calibrations for clay performed well (ME (modelling efficiency) > 0.82; RMSE (root mean squared error) < 10.9%), reflecting the influence of the direct spectral responses of this property in the vis-NIR range. Calibrations for OM were reasonably good, especially in view of the very small variation in this property (ME > 0.60; RMSE < 0.55%). The best results were, however, found when dividing the large library into smaller subsets by using variation in the mean-normalized or first derivative spectra. This divided the global data set into clusters that were more uniform in mineralogy, regardless of geographical origin, and improved predictive performance. The best clustering method improved the RMSE in the validation to 8.6% clay and 0.47% OM, which corresponds to a 21% and 15% reduction, respectively, as compared with whole library PLSR. For the whole library, SVM performed almost equally well, reducing RMSE to 8.9% clay and 0.48% OM. © 2014 British Society of Soil Science.",,"agricultural management; calibration; clay mineral; data mining; numerical model; performance assessment; prediction; soil organic matter; soil survey; soil type; spectroscopy; tropical environment; Brazil","Stenberg, B.; Department of Soil and Environment, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Gråbrödragatan 19, PO box 234, Sweden; email: bo.stenberg@slu.se",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13510754,,ESOSE,,"English","Eur.

Among the many challenges related to mining data streams, change detection is one topic frequently addressed. Being able to determine whether or not data characteristics are changing along time is a major concern for data stream algorithms, be it on the supervised or unsupervised scenario. The unsupervised scenario is particularly relevant due to many practical applications do not provide target labeling information. In this scenario, most of the strategies induce consecutive models over time and compare them in order to detect data changes. In this situation, model changes are assumed to be a consequence of data modifications. However, there is no guarantee this assumption is true, since those algorithms do not rely on any theoretical background to ensure that model divergences truly indicate data changes. The need for such theoretical framework has motivated this paper to propose a new stability concept to establish bounds on the learning abilities of unsupervised algorithms designed to detect changes on data streams. This stability concept, based on the surrogate data strategy from time series analysis, provides learning guarantees for online unsupervised algorithms even in case of time dependency among observations. Furthermore, we propose a new change detection algorithm that meets the requirements of this stability concept. Experimental results on different synthetical scenarios illustrate how the stability concept proposed in this paper is applied to detect changes in unsupervised data streams. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although variation in the long-term course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing symptom subtype distinctions, recent research suggests that prediction can be improved by using machine learning methods. However, it is not known whether these distinctions can be refined by added information about co-morbid conditions. The current report presents results on this question. Method. Data came from 8261 respondents with lifetime DSM-IV MDD in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Outcomes included four retrospectively reported measures of persistence/severity of course (years in episode; years in chronic episodes; hospitalization for MDD; disability due to MDD). Machine learning methods (regression tree analysis; lasso, ridge and elastic net penalized regression) followed by k-means cluster analysis were used to augment previously detected subtypes with information about prior co-morbidity to predict these outcomes. Results. Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors. Conclusions. Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","Co-morbidity; data mining; depression subtypes; depression symptom profiles; elastic net; machine learning; predictive modeling; risk assessment","adolescent; adult; aged; artificial intelligence; classification; cluster analysis; comorbidity; Depressive Disorder, Major; disease course; female; health; human; male; middle aged; retrospective study; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder, Major; Disease Progression; Female; Global Health; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult","Kessler, R.C.; Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical SchoolUnited States; email: kessler@hcp.med.harvard.edu",,"Cambridge University Press",00332917,,PSMDC,"25066141","English","Psychol.

Around 40% of afflicted patients remain without a molecular diagnosis after exclusion of known genes. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has opened avenues to the discovery of new implicated genes, but a working list of prioritized candidate genes is necessary to deal with the complexity of analyzing large-scale sequencing data. Here we used an integrative data mining strategy to analyze the genetic network linked to myopathies, derive specific signatures for inherited myopathy and related disorders, and identify and rank candidate genes for these groups. Training sets of genes were selected after literature review and used in Manteia, a public web-based data mining system, to extract disease group signatures in the form of enriched descriptor terms, which include functional annotation, human and mouse phenotypes, as well as biological pathways and protein interactions. These specific signatures were then used as an input to mine and rank candidate genes, followed by filtration against skeletal muscle expression and association with known diseases. Signatures and identified candidate genes highlight both potential common pathological mechanisms and allelic disease groups. Recent discoveries of gene associations to diseases, like B3GALNT2, GMPPB and B3GNT1 to congenital muscular dystrophies, were prioritized in the ranked lists, suggesting a posteriori validation of our approach and predictions. We show an example of how the ranked lists can be used to help analyze high-throughput sequencing data to identify candidate genes, and highlight the best candidate genes matching genomic regions linked to myopathies without known causative genes. This strategy can be automatized to generate fresh candidate gene lists, which help cope with database annotation updates as new knowledge is incorporated. © 2014 Neto et al.",,"allele; Article; B3GALNT2 gene; B3GNT1 gene; controlled study; data mining; filtration; gene; gene expression; gene identification; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic screening; genomics; GMPPB gene; high throughput sequencing; molecular biology; molecular pathology; monogenic disorder; muscular dystrophy; myopathy; phenotype; prediction; protein interaction; skeletal muscle; validation process; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; muscle disease; procedures; Data Mining; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Muscular Diseases; Phenotype","Neto, O.A.; Dept. of Translational Medicine and Neurogenetics, University of Strasbourg, Colleè ge de FranceFrance",,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"25353622","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908592834

One problem of context-aware approaches is that it is required techniques to extract such additional information in an automatic manner. In this paper, we propose to use two text mining techniques which are applied to textual data to infer contextual information automatically: named entities recognition and topic hierarchies. We evaluate the proposed technique in four context-aware recommender systems. The empirical results demonstrate that by using named entities and topic hierarchies we can provide better recommendations. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Character recognition; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Context-aware approaches; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual information; Contextual recommendations; Named entities; Text mining techniques; Textual data; Topic hierarchy; Data mining","Domingues, M.A.; Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of São PauloBrazil","Skowron A.Dey L.Krasuski A.Li Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479941438,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/WIC/ACM Int.

In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to predict variations in vote intention based on sentiment time series extracted from news comments, using three Brazilian elections as case study. The contributions of this case study are: a) the comparison of two approaches for opinion mining in user-generated content in Brazilian Portuguese, b) the proposition of two types of features to represent sentiment behavior towards political candidates that can be used for prediction, c) an approach to predict polls vote intention variations that is adequate for scenarios of sparse data. We developed experiments to assess the influence on the forecasting accuracy of the proposed features, and their respective preparation. Our results display an accuracy of 70[%] in predicting positive and negative variations.

However, recent active learning methods have focused on strategies in which a large unlabeled dataset has to be reprocessed at each learning iteration. As the datasets grow, these strategies become inefficient or even a tremendous computational challenge. In order to address these issues, we propose an effective and efficient active learning paradigm which attains a significant reduction in the size of the learning set by applying an a priori process of identification and organization of a small relevant subset. Furthermore, the concomitant classification and selection processes enable the classification of a very small number of samples, while selecting the informative ones. Experimental results showed that the proposed paradigm allows to achieve high accuracy quickly with minimum user interaction, further improving its efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To bypass problems related to the use of computational resources to process large volumes of data, an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) technique with zero latency can be used, that works by constantly processing small data loads. Among the extraction techniques of the zero latency ETL are the use of logs, triggers, materialized views and timestamps.

Thus the aim of this work was to visualize and quantify, through X-ray CT scan, the pores distribution in an oxidic Latosol submitted to a conservation management system with different gypsum doses. Three random trenches were dug lengthwise along the plant row in a very clayey gibbsitic dystrophic Red Latosol, subjected to the following gypsum levels: G0: absence of gypsum; G7: 7 Mg ha-1 and G28: 28 Mg ha-1 of additional gypsum, applied to the surface of the plant row. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in plexiglass tubes at depths of 0.20-0.34, 0.80-0.94 and 1.50-1.64 m after six years of coffee cultivation for quantification of 3D pores obtained by X-ray CT scan. The spatial variability of the soil structure was evaluated by semivariograms generated by 3D images in grayscale. Distribution of the detectable pore diameter was conducted by data mining. Statistical analyzes employed packages ‘geoR’ to semivariogram and ‘randomForest’ for data mining in R language. A greater spatial continuity of the pores occurred in the G7 at the three depths. The combined effects of the management system promoted a greater spatial variability of the soil structure in the G28 treatment. Based on geostatistical analyses, it can be infer that the adoption of the system under study promoted changes in the pore network in all directions (X, Y and Z), however with better pores continuity in the vertical direction(Z). © 2014, Federal University of Lavras.

Compounds like curcumin, genistein, plant and food polyphenols, resveratrol, and sulforaphane are able to modulate the biological activity of cell pathways and its functions in relation to metabolism and epigenetics. While the mechanisms by which these compounds exert their roles are still far to be fully elucidated, their usage has emerged in the past years for conceiving new cancer prevention strategies and novel therapeutic interventions. A deeper understanding on how metabolism and epigenetics are influenced by food and natural components can be achieved at molecular level by using a variety of chemoinformatic and computer-aided techniques that include data mining, molecular databasing, and molecular design techniques like pharmacophore-based methods or molecular docking. In this chapter, we will describe these in silico techniques as valuable tools to explore molecular determinants, and pharmacological role of food and other natural constituents in cancer epigenetics and metabolism. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

All this content needs to be explored by means of text mining, natural language processing, information retrieval, and other techniques. In this context, automatic keyword extraction is a task of great usefulness. A fundamental step in text mining techniques consists of building a model for text representation. The model known as vector space model, VSM, is the most well-known and used among these techniques. However, some difficulties and limitations of VSM, such as scalability and sparsity, motivate the proposal of alternative approaches. This paper proposes a keyword extraction method for tweet collections that represents texts as graphs and applies centrality measures for finding the relevant vertices (keywords). To assess the performance of the proposed approach, three different sets of experiments are performed. The first experiment applies TKG to a text from the Time magazine and compares its performance with that of the literature. The second set of experiments takes tweets from three different TV shows, applies TKG and compares it with TFIDF and KEA, having human classifications as benchmarks. Finally, these three algorithms are applied to tweets sets of increasing size and their computational running time is measured and compared. Altogether, these experiments provide a general overview of how TKG can be used in practice, its performance when compared with other standard approaches, and how it scales to larger data instances. The results show that TKG is a novel and robust proposal to extract keywords from texts, particularly from short messages, such as tweets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here we assess these two parameters for the NCI-60, which is among the richest genomic and pharmacological publicly available cancer cell line databases. Homozygous genetic variants that putatively affect protein function were identified in 1,199 genes (approximately 6% of all genes). Variants that are either enriched or depleted compared to non-cancerous genomes, and thus may be influential in cancer progression and differential drug response were identified for 2,546 genes. Potential gene knockouts are made available. Assessment of cell line response to 19,940 compounds, including 110 FDA-approved drugs, reveals ≈80-fold range in resistance versus sensitivity response across cell lines. 103,422 gene variants were significantly correlated with at least one compound (at p<0.0002). These include genes of known pharmacological importance such as IGF1R, BRAF, RAD52, MTOR, STAT2 and TSC2 as well as a large number of candidate genes such as NOM1, TLL2, and XDH. We introduce two new web-based CellMiner applications that enable exploration of variant-to-compound relationships for a broad range of researchers, especially those without bioinformatics support. The first tool, ""Genetic variant versus drug visualization"", provides a visualization of significant correlations between drug activity-gene variant combinations. Examples are given for the known vemurafenib-BRAF, and novel ifosfamide-RAD52 pairings. The second, ""Genetic variant summation"" allows an assessment of cumulative genetic variations for up to 150 combined genes together; and is designed to identify the variant burden for molecular pathways or functional grouping of genes. An example of its use is provided for the EGFR-ERBB2 pathway gene variant data and the identification of correlated EGFR, ERBB2, MTOR, BRAF, MEK and ERK inhibitors.

A variation of the traditional univariate approach is the so-called oblique decision tree, which allows multivariate tests in its non-terminal nodes. Oblique decision trees can model decision boundaries that are oblique to the attribute axes, whereas univariate trees can only perform axis-parallel splits. The vast majority of the oblique and univariate decision-tree induction algorithms employ a top-down strategy for growing the tree, relying on an impurity-based measure for splitting nodes. In this paper, we propose BUTIF-a novel Bottom- Up Oblique Decision- Tree Induction Framework. BUTIF does not rely on an impurity-measure for dividing nodes, since the data resulting from each split is known a priori. For generating the initial leaves of the tree and the splitting hyperplanes in its internal nodes, BUTIF allows the adoption of distinct clustering algorithms and binary classifiers, respectively. It is also capable of performing embedded feature selection, which may reduce the number of features in each hyperplane, thus improving model comprehension. Different from virtually every top-down decision-tree induction algorithm, BUTIF does not require the further execution of a pruning procedure in order to avoid overfitting, due to its bottom-up nature that does not overgrow the tree. We compare distinct instances of BUTIF to traditional univariate and oblique decision-tree induction algorithms. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bottom-up induction; Clustering; Oblique decision trees","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Geometry; Trees (mathematics); Bottom-up induction; Clustering; Decision-tree induction; Embedded feature selections; Knowledge discovery and data minings; Model comprehensibilities; Modeling decisions; Oblique decision tree; Binary trees; algorithm; article; classifier; decision tree; machine learning; oblique decision tree; priority journal; probability; support vector machine; analysis of variance; Article; Bottom Up Oblique Decision Tree Induction Framework; conceptual framework; data mining; discriminant analysis; evolutionary algorithm; information processing; learning algorithm; logistic regression analysis","Barros, R.C.; Faculdade de Informática, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

This algorithm employs a niche technique combined with a population archive in order to identify the rules that are more suitable for classifying items amongst classes of a given data set. The algorithm is implemented in such a way that the user can choose the function set that is more adequate for a given application. This feature makes the proposed approach virtually applicable to any kind of data set classification problem. Besides, the classification problem is modeled as a multi-objective one, in which the maximization of the accuracy and the minimization of the classifier complexity are considered as the objective functions. A set of different classification problems, with considerably different data sets and domains, has been considered: wines, patients with hepatitis, incipient faults in power transformers and level of development of cities. In this last data set, some of the attributes are geographical, and they are expressed as points, lines or polygons. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been compared with three other methods, widely employed for classification: Decision Tree (C4.5), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Statistical comparisons have been conducted employing one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests, in order to provide reliable comparison of the methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieved better classification effectiveness in all tested instances, what suggests that it is suitable for a considerable range of classification applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Classification rules; Genetic programming; Multi-objective algorithm; Spatial data mining","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Genetic programming; Power transformers; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Classification rules; Incipient faults; Multi objective; Multi objective algorithm; Objective functions; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Spatial data mining; Statistical comparisons; Data mining; article; building; city; classification algorithm; controlled study; data base; decision tree; gas analysis; genetic algorithm; genetic variability; geography; hepatitis; human; intermethod comparison; logic; measurement accuracy; power supply; priority journal; radial based function; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; wine",,,"Elsevier",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894595903

A number of studies linked TEs with satDNAs, but the nature of their evolutionary relationships remains unclear. During in silico analyses of the Drosophila virilis assembled genome, we found a novel DNA transposon we named Tetris based on its modular structure and diversity of rearranged forms. We aimed to characterize Tetris and investigate its role in generating satDNAs. Data mining and sequence analysis showed that Tetris is apparently nonautonomous, with a structure similar to foldback elements, and present in D. virilis and D. americana. Herein, we show that Tetris shares the final portions of its terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) with DAIBAM, a previously described miniature inverted transposable element implicated in the generation of chromosome inversions. Both elements are likely to be mobilized by the same autonomous TE. Tetris TIRs contain approximately 220-bp internal tandem repeats that we have named TIR-220. We also found TIR-220 repeats making up longer (kb-size) satDNA-like arrays. Using bioinformatic, phylogenetic and cytogenomic tools, we demonstrated that Tetris has contributed to shaping the genomes of D. virilis and D. americana, providing internal tandem repeats that served as building blocks for the amplification of satDNA arrays. The β-heterochromatic genomic environment seemed to have favored such amplification. Our results imply for the first time a role for foldback elements in generating satDNAs. © The Author(s) 2014.

Although FAS is a well-described pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression are virtually unknown. Moreover, alcohol abuse can affect vitamin metabolism and absorption, although how alcohol impairs such biochemical pathways remains to be elucidated. We employed a variety of systems chemo-biology tools to understand the interplay between ethanol metabolism and vitamins during mouse neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we designed interactomes and employed transcriptomic data analysis approaches to study the neural tissue of Mus musculus exposed to ethanol prenatally and postnatally, simulating conditions that could lead to FAS development at different life stages. Our results showed that FAS can promote early changes in neurotransmitter release and glutamate equilibrium, as well as an abnormal calcium influx that can lead to neuroinflammation and impaired neurodifferentiation, both extensively connected with vitamin action and metabolism. Genes related to retinoic acid, niacin, vitamin D, and folate metabolism were underexpressed during neurodevelopment and appear to contribute to neuroinflammation progression and impaired synapsis. Our results also indicate that genes coding for tubulin, tubulin-associated proteins, synapse plasticity proteins, and proteins related to neurodifferentiation are extensively affected by ethanol exposure.

While dozens of classification algorithms have been applied to time series, recent empirical evidence strongly suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult to beat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm is important, and depends on the invariances required by the domain. For example, motion capture data typically requires invariance to warping, and cardiology data requires invariance to the baseline (the mean value). Similarly, recent work suggests that for time series clustering, the choice of clustering algorithm is much less important than the choice of distance measure used.In this work we make a somewhat surprising claim. There is an invariance that the community seems to have missed, complexity invariance. Intuitively, the problem is that in many domains the different classes may have different complexities, and pairs of complex objects, even those which subjectively may seem very similar to the human eye, tend to be further apart under current distance measures than pairs of simple objects. This fact introduces errors in nearest neighbor classification, where some complex objects may be incorrectly assigned to a simpler class. Similarly, for clustering this effect can introduce errors by ""suggesting"" to the clustering algorithm that subjectively similar, but complex objects belong in a sparser and larger diameter cluster than is truly warranted.We introduce the first complexity-invariant distance measure for time series, and show that it generally produces significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracy. We further show that this improvement does not compromise efficiency, since we can lower bound the measure and use a modification of triangular inequality, thus making use of most existing indexing and data mining algorithms. We evaluate our ideas with the largest and most comprehensive set of time series mining experiments ever attempted in a single work, and show that complexity-invariant distance measures can produce improvements in classification and clustering in the vast majority of cases. © 2013 The Author(s).","Classification; Clustering; Complexity; Similarity measures; Time series",,"Batista, G.E.A.P.A.; University of California, Riverside, 900 University Ave, Riverside, CA 92521, United States; email: gbatista@cs.ucr.edu",,,13845810,,,,"English","Data Min.

In addition to classic laboratory studies (cell and animal models), we have used elite athletes and sports to examine metabolic stress. Our central question involves the ability of the body to protect the central nervous system from high and toxic ammonemia during acute and chronic exercise. Information about this problem can aid in understanding important signaling pathways, which may yield better ways to protect people who suffer from diseases that lead to hyperammonemia, such as liver failure, or to hypermetabolic states, such as cancer or thermal injury. We proposed a Sportomics approach to mimic the real challenges and conditions that are faced during sports training and competition. Sportomics is non-hypothesis-driven research on an individual's metabolite changes during sports and exercise. It is similar to metabolomics and other ""-omics"" approaches, but Sportomics focuses on sports as a metabolic challenge. Our study is holistic and top-down; we treat the data systematically and have generated a large computer-searchable database. We also propose that in-field metabolic analyses are important for understanding, supporting and training elite athletes. In this review, we discuss Sportomics history, problems, benefits and results. We included different weather conditions, such as temperature, wind and humidity, and diverse metabolic responses due to uneven sleep and eating behaviors near the time of the experiment. We are currently generating databases as well as data-mining principles and procedures to improve metabolomics and proteomics studies as well as adding genomics and transcriptomics studies to the Sportomics approach. We believe that this approach can fill a methodological gap between systems biology and translational medicine similar as a bench to the field approach. © 2014 The Authors.

One of them, k-means, has been elected as one of the most influential data mining algorithms for being simple, scalable and easily modifiable to a variety of contexts and application domains. Although distributed versions of k-means have been proposed, the algorithm is still sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster prototypes and requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance. In this paper, we propose the use of evolutionary algorithms to overcome the k-means limitations and, at the same time, to deal with distributed data. Two different distribution approaches are adopted: the first obtains a final model identical to the centralized version of the clustering algorithm; the second generates and selects clusters for each distributed data subset and combines them afterwards. The algorithms are compared experimentally from two perspectives: the theoretical one, through asymptotic complexity analyses; and the experimental one, through a comparative evaluation of results obtained from a collection of experiments and statistical tests. The obtained results indicate which variant is more adequate for each application scenario. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed clustering; Distributed data mining; Evolutionary k-means","Asymptotic complexity; Clustering techniques; Comparative evaluations; Data mining algorithm; Different distributions; Distributed clustering; Distributed data mining; K-means; Asymptotic complexity; Clustering techniques; Comparative evaluations; Data mining algorithm; Different distributions; Distributed clustering; Distributed data mining; K-means; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Algorithms; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Clustering algorithms; article; cluster analysis; combinations of distributed clustering algorithm; data mining; data processing; distributed data mining; distributed fast evolutionary algorithm for clustering; evolutionary algorithm; evolutionary k means; priority journal; Article; calculation; cluster analysis; comparative study; controlled study; genotype; mathematical analysis","Naldi, M.C.; Federal Univ. of Viçosa, UFV.

However, traditional decision-tree induction algorithms implement a greedy approach for node splitting that is inherently susceptible to local optima convergence. Evolutionary algorithms can avoid the problems associated with a greedy search and have been successfully employed to the induction of decision trees. Previously, we proposed a lexicographic multi-objective genetic algorithm for decision-tree induction, named LEGAL-Tree. In this work, we propose extending this approach substantially, particularly w.r.t. two important evolutionary aspects: the initialization of the population and the fitness function. We carry out a comprehensive set of experiments to validate our extended algorithm.

A stream is an ordered sequence of data records. It is characterized by properties such as the potentially infinite and rapid flow of instances. However, a property that is common to various application domains and is frequently disregarded is the very high fluctuating data rates. In domains with fluctuating data rates, the events do not occur with a fixed frequency. This imposes an additional challenge for the classifiers since the next event can occur at any time after the previous one. Anytime classification provides a very convenient approach for fluctuating data rates. In summary, an anytime classifier can be interrupted at any time before its completion and still be able to provide an intermediate solution. The popular k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier can be easily made anytime by introducing a ranking of the training examples. A classification is achieved by scanning the training examples according to this ranking. In this paper, we show how the current state-of-the-art k-NN anytime classifier can be made more accurate by introducing diversity in the training set ranking. Our results show that, with this simple modification, the performance of the anytime version of the k-NN algorithm is consistently improved for a large number of datasets. © 2014 IEEE.","Anytime Algorithm; Classification; Data Stream; Nearest Neighbor","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Any-time algorithms; Data stream; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbor classification; Nearest neighbors; Simple modifications; State of the art; Training example; Classification (of information)",,"Ferri C.Qu G.Chen X.Wani M.A.Angelov P.Lai J.-H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479974153,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Some researches have been combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristics to adaptively guide and improve the search for near optimal solutions. An example of such development is the DM-GRASP, a hybrid version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedures (GRASP) metaheuristic which incorporates a data mining process. In this hybrid proposal, after executing half of the total number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of sub-optimal solutions for the optimization problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following half GRASP iterations in the search through the solution space. In this work, we explore new versions of the DM-GRASP metaheuristic to experiment, not a single activation, but multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process during the metaheuristic execution. We also applied the data mining technique into a reactive GRASP to show that a more sophisticated and not memoryless GRASP approach can also benefit from the use of this technique. In order to evaluate these new proposals, we adopted the server replication for reliable multicast problem since the best known results for this problem were obtained by GRASP and DM-GRASP implementations.

Semantic trajectory data analysis has received significant attention recently, but the formal definition of semantic trajectory, the set of aspects that should be considered to semantically enrich trajectories and a conceptual data model integrating these aspects from a broad sense is still missing. This article presents a semantic trajectory conceptual data model named CONSTAnT, which defines the most important aspects of semantic trajectories. We believe that this model will be the foundation for the design of semantic trajectory databases, where several aspects that make a trajectory ""semantic"" are taken into account. The proposed model includes the concepts of semantic subtrajectory, semantic points, geographical places, events, goals, environment and behavior, to create a general concept of semantic trajectory. The proposed model is the result of several years of work by the authors in an effort to add more semantics to raw trajectory data for real applications. Two application examples and different queries show the flexibility of the model for different domains. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"data mining; database; modeling; trajectory","Bogorny, V.; Department of Informatics and Statistics, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil; email: vania@inf.ufsc.br",,,13611682,,TRGIF,,"English","Trans.

We analyze the moving average, exponential smoothing methods, and a new class of smoothing operators based on linearly decaying weights from the perspective of ordered weights averaging to estimate a constant model. We examine two important features associated with the smoothing processes: the average age of the data and the expected variance, both defined in terms of the associated weights. We show that there exists a fundamental conflict between keeping the variance small while using the freshest data. We illustrate the flexibility of the smoothing methods with real datasets; that is, we evaluate the aggregation operators with respect to their minimal attainable variance versus average age. We also examine the efficiency of the smoothed models in time series smoothing, considering real datasets. Good smoothing generally depends upon the underlying method's ability to select appropriate weights to satisfy the criteria of both small variance and recent data. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Aggregation operators; data mining; smoothing techniques; time series","Aggregation operator; Exponential smoothing method; Important features; Smoothing methods; Smoothing operator; Smoothing process; Smoothing techniques; Weighted averaging; Data mining; Data processing; Mathematical operators; Time series","Institute of Economics, University of Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo 13083-857, Brazil",,,02184885,,IJUSF,,"English","Int.

It is related to Fractional PCA (FPCA), which is based on the theory of fractional covariance matrix, and it is an extension of the classical Eigenfaces. Like FPCA, it computes projections for a low dimensional space from the fractional covariance matrix and similar to the Eigenfaces, it is suited for high dimensional data. Moreover, the proposed technique extends the fractional transformation of the data for more stages of the feature extractions than FPCA. The Fractional Eigenfaces is evaluated in three different face databases.

Our proposal combines the characteristics of data mining techniques with a continuous stream of input data, and with high processing performance GPU architecture. Results show that our approach provides accuracy comparable to or better than existing related work (e.g., above 95%) while ramping up performance (e.g., up to 62x speed up), comparing the different implementations of our approach.

Thirty-eight culms of bamboo were used, in which the following variables were measured: diameter at breast height, stem diameter, stem and its height. The stems were felled and weighed by using the destructive method. The actual biomass of 25 stems was used to fit the equations by the least squares method and 13 stems were used for the validation of the best equation. The fractions of biomass per compartment differ significantly (p < 0.05) among each other. The largest fraction of the biomass corresponds to the stem, representing 69.2% of the total, followed by rhizomes, leaves and branches, with 15.7, 10.8 and 4.2%, respectively. The best fitted equation for total biomass showed a correlation coefficient of 0.93 and standard error of estimate of 15%. On the other hand, the data mining technique showed a correlation coefficient of 0.81, with a standard error of 23.8%. Biomass of Guadua bamboo can be accurately estimated either by linear regression or data mining. In this work, the regression method performed better. Data limitations can be the key factor for the poor performance of data mining technique since once it requires a larger data set to function satisfactorily.","Biomass; Correlation; Data mining; Linear regression; Poaceae","Guadua; Poaceae","Corte, A.P.D.; Engenheira Florestal, Doutora.

The unavailability of large sources of data and data complexity are some of the difficulties encountered. This is especially true for rare and neglected diseases. Those databases are, in general, relatively small, wide and sparse, making them very challenging to analyze. There are also ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and clinical validation of the findings. This work proposes a way of dealing with this challenge with a case study of data mining applied in a Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) patients database. Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a typical Brazilian disease, caused by the yeast Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. This disease represents an important Public Health issue, due to its high incapacitating potential and the amount of premature deaths it causes if untreated. This paper discusses methods for the analysis of this complex dataset, to help increase the understanding of both the disease and this type of data. Despite the challenges of the dataset, some interesting findings were made being: flaws in form filling protocols, notably the lack of chest X-ray in 40% of the records; the discovery of a possible new relation between smoking habits and PCM evolution time. The average evolution time for smoking patients was 2.8 times longer; the successful classification/prediction of the cutaneous form of the disease with a 93% precision rate are some of the discoveries made. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Database systems; Clinical validations; Data complexity; Medical data mining; Medical database; Neglected disease; Paracoccidioides brasiliensis; Precision rates; Public health issues; Medical computing","Ferreira, E.L.; Department of Computer Science, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: eduardoferreira@ufmg.br",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479966448,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The proposed methodology is illustrated by means of simulations in three datasets that are benchmarks for data mining methods: Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Mushroom and Congressional Voting Records. Three classifiers were employed to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The average classification rates obtained in the datasets formed by all features are compared to those achieved in the datasets formed by the features that belong to the Markov Blanket.

Aiming at reducing this subjectivity and mitigating possible losses, many approaches have been proposed to select the candidates that best fit into a given position. However, defining what are the most important features for a good personnel performance is still a problem. This paper details the ideas and results presented in two previous works that describe an approach, based on data mining techniques, to help managers in this process. A classifier, built over the combinatorial neural model (CNM), is described that takes as dependent variable the performance of managers as observed along their careers. As independent variables, we considered the results of well-known psychological tests (MBTI and DISC). The rules generated correlate psychological profiles of novice managers and the quality of their work after some years. These results enable a better management of people selection and allocation.

The popularization of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) increased the computing power of current desktop computers, but desktop-based data mining tools do not usually take full advantage of these architectures. This paper exploits an approach to improve the performance of Weka, a popular data mining tool, through parallelization on GPU-accelerated machines. From the profiling of Weka object-oriented code, we chose to parallelize a matrix multiplication method using state-of-the-art tools. The implementation was merged into Weka so that we could analyze the impact of parallel execution on its performance. The results show a significant speedup on the target parallel architectures, compared to the original, sequential Weka code. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Data mining tools; GPU; Parallel computing","Computer graphics; Energy conservation; Graphics processing unit; Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Personal computers; Program processors; Data-mining tools; GPU accelerations; MAtrix multiplication; Object-oriented code; Parallel com- puting; Parallel executions; Parallelizations; Performance improvements; Data mining","Charão, A.S.; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa-Maria, Brazil; email: andrea@inf.ufsm.br","Yasar A.Shakshuki E.","Elsevier B.V.",18770509,,,,"English","Procedia Comput.

Most of the existing attribute selection methods can only handle simple attribute types, such as categorical and numerical. In particular, these methods cannot be applied to multivalued attributes, which are attributes that take multiple values simultaneously for the same instance in the dataset. This article proposes two relevance measures for multivalued attributes, which aim at measuring their importance for classification. The proposed measures are adaptations of two widely used relevance measures for categorical attributes: information gain and gain ratio. In order to evaluate the proposed measures, experiments were conducted with multiclass datasets submitted to multi-relational classifiers. The experiments show that the proposed measures are good indicators of the relevance of multivalued attributes for multiclass classification. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Attribute selection; Classification; Multi-relational data Mining; Multivalued attributes; Relevance measures","Data mining; Numerical methods; Attribute selection; Categorical attributes; Information gain; Knowledge discovery in database; Multi-class classification; Multi-valued attribute; Multirelational data mining; Relevance measure; Classification (of information)","Tasca, M.; Instituto de Computaҫão, Universidade Federal FluminenseBrazil",,"Springer Verlag",03029743,,,,"English","Lect.

For example, anticipated detection of company bankruptcy, for sure, will help both the investor interested in the company as their managers. The challenge of exploring the huge amount of data to consider in such analysis can benefit from adequate data mining tools. A comparative analysis of classification algorithms for this kind of application is presented in order to find a better predictive performance. The experiments were performed on data from publicly traded companies registered in the São Paulo Securities, Commodities and Futures Exchange (Bovespa) that appeared at least twice from 1996 to 2010. Moreover, some experiments were carried out with the set of candidate attributes, in this case financial ratios and ledger accounts that could better explain the target variable. The better results were found with a committee of classifiers using both financial ratios and ledger accounts, although, the ledger accounts alone presented a higher prediction power than financial ratios. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

The proposed approach was built following the steps of data mining for the clustering task, resulting in a computer application that generates maps of management zones and yield areas, allowing to compare them using known statistical indexes. The basis for this implementation was a model previously published in the literature that uses only historical productivity, soil electrical conductivity and relief data to generate the maps. The main difference of our work with respect to the previous model is the clustering algorithms used in the step of extracting patterns. While the original model uses only the fuzzy c-means algorithm, the model developed in this study uses the GKCluster extension to this algorithm, able to detect clusters with different geometrical shapes. From the tests performed with the new proposed model, we achieved about 76% of correlation between maps of yield and management zones from kappa index, and about 85% of correlation from overall accuracy. The original model reached, according to the authors, a maximum correlation of 49% from kappa index, and 70% from overall accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.","clustering; management zones; precision agriculture; spatial data mining","Agriculture; Copying; Data mining; Fuzzy clustering; Mathematical models; Cluster based approach; clustering; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Management zones; Maximum correlations; Precision Agriculture; Soil electrical conductivity; Spatial data mining; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479942886,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In remote sensing, this scenario of bursting data is not different. As the volume of satellite images stored in databases grows, the demand for computational algorithms that can handle and analyze this volume of data and extract useful patterns has increased. In this context, the computational support for satellite images data analysis becomes essential. In this work, we present the SITSMining framework, which applies a methodology based on data mining techniques to extract patterns and information from time series obtained from satellite images. In Brazil, as the agricultural production provides great part of the national resources, the analysis of satellite images is a valuable way to help crops monitoring over seasons, which is an important task to the economy of the country.

Fifty-four coffee samples (20 organic and 34 non-organic) were evaluated according to their macro and microelement contents to establish reference ranges and identify differences in patterns of chemical elements in both crop procedures. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of thirty-eight chemical elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Eu, Er, Gd, Ge, Ho, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sm, Sr, Yb, W, U, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, Tl, Zr and Zn). In general, higher levels of chemical elements were found in conventional coffee compared with organic samples. The classification of samples was performed by using three well known data mining algorithms, named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). When all analyzed variables were considered, a 96.3% accuracy level was obtained with the three algorithms. The level of accuracy remained at 96.3% for SVM and MLP and rose to 98.2 for NB when only eight of the investigated minerals - i.e. Zn, Se, Ba, U, Dy, Tl, Th, Mo - were used for chemometric analysis.

This paper applied data mining techniques to discover knowledge in the field of water quality monitoring data, providing useful and relevant support for decision-making in environmental management systems. At the current stage of research, a predictive modelling technique, known as rule-based classification, was used to find rules that can, based on the values of certain chemical parameters, predict the ecotoxicity level of a water sample. We used data from water analyses from main water bodies of São Paulo state in Brazil, from 2005 to 2010. We expect to get a reliable, fast and effective way to predict the ecotoxicity levels of water in rivers, lakes and reservoirs based on analyses of chemical parameters, or indicate the complementarity of these measurements for optimisation of monitoring networks and the consequent improvement natural resources management.

In this paper, we propose a novel and non-intrusive approach for collecting provenance data in digital games. Our proposal collects provenance data using image processing mechanisms and pre-defined image patterns, thus avoiding accessing and modifying the source code of the game.

The independent variables were 23, obtained from the weather station, and the dependent variable was the monthly progress rate for the coffee rust, which was generated by the values of disease incidence. The most important features were refined by feature selection techniques, and the modeling was performed using four data mining techniques: support vector machines, artificial neural networks, decision trees and random forests. For high fruit load years the best accuracy was 85.3% and for low fruit load years it was 88.9%. Other performance measures like recall and specificity also had high and balanced values.

Among them, it is possible to mention the execution of more complex query types (e.g., similarity queries) and several well-known data mining algorithms (e.g., data clustering) that are directly based on similarity computations. In order to speed up the similarity-based comparisons performed by these approaches, it is possible to store the dataset in specialized data structures known as metric access methods (MAM).Results: These policies allow faster tree construction, as they result in better distribution of elements on the tree nodes and require less distance calculations when compared with the previously proposed ones. Furthermore, trees built with these policies have shown to be more efficient for techniques that require similarity computations, such as nearest neighbors queries and data clustering algorithms.Conclusion: The experimental results show that trees built with the proposed policies outperform those built with the original ones with regard to the number of disk accesses, the amount of distance calculations, and the time required to run the queries. © 2014, Souza et al.; licensee Springer.","Data mining; Metric access methods; Multimedia indexing; Similarity queries","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Data clustering algorithm; Data mining algorithm; Distance calculation; Distribution of element; Metric access methods; Multimedia indexing; Similarity computation; Similarity query; Trees (mathematics)","de Souza, J.A.; Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação, USP, Trabalhador Saocarlense, 400, São Carlos, Brazil",,"Springer London",01046500,,,,"English","J.

Many solutions, including the application of decision support systems (DSS), have been proposed to assist in ATFM. A large amount of recorded historical data provides opportunities to improve the effectiveness of DSS as well as a great challenge to develop such a system. This paper presents an approach that creates useful knowledge for DSS in real-time based on Big Data Structures. The proposed approach uses a Bayesian network for the data mining process to reduce flight costs. The process adjusts a flight plan such as the schedule of arrival at or departure from an airport and checking in airspace controls considering schedule and weather conditions. An experimental study is conducted on flights between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Miami International Airport (MIA).","Air traffic flow management; Big data; Data mining; Real-time problem","Air transportation; Aircraft; Aircraft control; Airports; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Big data; Costs; Data mining; Decision support systems; Air traffic flow management; Air transportation systems; Data mining methods; Decision support system (dss); Deficient management; Los angeles international airports; Miami International Airport; Real-time problems; Air traffic control",,"Lagaros N.D.Karlaftis M.G.Papadrakakis M.","National Technical University of Athens",,9789609999465,,,"English","OPT-i - Int.

Process mining is one of the techniques that can be used to assist process assessments, in order to conduct assessments with greater coverage and reliability while keeping lower cost and effort. The aim of this paper is to present a framework to apply process mining techniques in software process assessments.

Previously, we developed a database that annotates sequence data from GenBank and the present study aimed to describe the clinical, molecular and epidemiological scenarios of HTLV-1 infection through the stored sequences in this database. A total of 2,545 registered complete and partial sequences of HTLV-1 were collected and 1,967 (77.3%) of those sequences represented unique isolates. Among these isolates, 93% contained geographic origin information and only 39% were related to any clinical status. A total of 1,091 sequences contained information about the geographic origin and viral subtype and 93% of these sequences were identified as subtype ""a"". Ethnicity data are very scarce. Regarding clinical status data, 29% of the sequences were generated from TSP/HAM and 67.8% from healthy carrier individuals. Although the data mining enabled some inferences about specific aspects of HTLV-1 infection to be made, due to the relative scarcity of data of available sequences, it was not possible to delineate a global scenario of HTLV-1 infection.","Data mining; HTLV-1; HTLV-1 database","adult; computer interface; data mining; female; genetics; health; HTLV-I Infections; human; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; male; medical geography; molecular epidemiology; nucleic acid database; nucleotide sequence; virology; Adult; Base Sequence; Data Mining; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Female; Geography, Medical; Global Health; HTLV-I Infections; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Male; Molecular Epidemiology; User-Computer Interface","Alcântara, L.

The basic idea is to identify similarities among functions and to use the passes previously explored each time a new function is being compiled. This subset of compiler optimizations is then used by a Design Space Exploration (DSE) process. The identification of similarities is obtained by a data mining method which is applied to a symbolic code representation that translates the main structures of the source code to a sequence of symbols based on transformation rules. Experiments were performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The selection of compiler optimization sequences considering a set of 49 compilation passes and targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor was performed aiming at latency improvements for 41 functions from Texas Instruments benchmarks. The results reveal that the passes selection based on our clustering method achieves a significant gain on execution time over the full search space still achieving important performance speedups. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Codes (symbols); Data mining; Metadata; Systems analysis; Clustering methods; Code representation; Compiler optimizations; Data mining methods; Design space exploration; Selection based; Texas Instruments; Transformation rules; Program compilers","Martins, L.G.A.; Faculty of Computing, Federal University of UberlândiaBrazil",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479914883,,,"English","Proc.

This paper addresses neural network (NN) learning in non-stationary environments related to financial markets, aiming at forecasting stock closing price. To face up this dynamic scenario, an efficient NN model is required. Therefore, Constructive Neural Networks (CoNN) were employed due to its self-adaptation capability, in contrast to regular NN which demands parameter adjustment. This paper investigates a possible ensemble organization, composed by NN's trained with the Cascade Correlation CoNN algorithm. An ensemble is an effective approach to non-stationary learning because it provides pre-defined rules that enable new learners - with new knowledge - to take part of the ensemble along data stream processing. Results obtained with data stream related with four different stocks are then analysed and favorably compared with those obtained with the traditional MLP NNs, trained with Backpropagation. © 2014 IEEE.","Backpropagation; Cascade Correlation; Constructive neural networks; Ensemble; Learning in non-stationary environments; Temporal data mining","Backpropagation; Data communication systems; Data handling; Data mining; Financial markets; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Cascade correlation; Constructive neural network; Ensemble; Non-stationary environment; Temporal data mining; Information management",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479956180,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Virtually all human endeavors create time-oriented data, and the Data Mining community has proposed a large number of approaches to analyze such data. One of the most common tasks in Data Mining is classification, in which each time series should be associated to a class. Empirical evidence has shown that the nearest neighbor rule is very effective to classify time series data. However, the nearest neighbor classifier is unable to provide any form of explanation. In this chapter we describe a novel method to induce classifiers from time series data. Our approach uses standard Machine Learning classifiers using motifs and characteristics as features. We show that our approach can be very effective for classification, providing higher accuracy for most of the data sets used in an empirical evaluation. In addition, when used with symbolic models, such as decision trees, our approach provides very compact decision rules, leveraging knowledge discovery from time series. We also show two case studies with real world medical data.© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",,,,,"Springer Verlag",1860949X,9783642537363,,,"English","Stud. Comput.

Various tools are available to the developers to track and analyze general data concerning acquisition, retention and monetization aspects of game commercialization. This is good enough to give hints on where problems are, but not to enable a precise diagnosis, which demands fine-grained data. For this kind of data, there is not enough support or guidance to decide which data to capture, to write the code to capture it, to choose the best representation of it and to allow an adequate retrieval and presentation of it. This paper introduces GameGuts (GG), a framework devoted to give further assistance to developers in choosing, representing, accessing and presenting game sessions fine-grained data. As a case study, GG recorded sessions of a game platform with over a hundred thousand users. The logs were analyzed using a Visual Domain Specific Language (as a query language) and an ensemble of rules (as a compliance test).

In this study, a case-comparison study of automatic document classification (ADC) approach is presented, utilizing both serial and parallel paradigms. The serial approach was implemented by adopting the RapidMiner software tool, which is recognized as the worldleading open-source system for data mining. On the other hand, considering the MapReduce programming model, the Hadoop software environment has been used. The main goal of this case-comparison study is to exploit differences between these two paradigms, especially when large volumes of data such as Web text documents are utilized to build a category database. In the literature, many studies point out that distributed processing in unstructured documents have been yielding efficient results in utilizing Hadoop. Results from our research indicate a threshold to such efficiency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data mining; Open source software; Open systems; Comparison study; Differential information; Distributed processing; Document Classification; Map-reduce programming; Open source system; Software environments; Unstructured documents; Information retrieval systems","Wilges, B.; Department of Engineering and Knowledge Management (EGC), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)Brazil","Dursi J.Mewhort D.Abukhdeir N.M.Jurisica I.Slater G.Daley M.Meyer R.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17426588,,,,"English","J.

Much of that data is provided by search result pages, in which each result, called search result record, represents a record from a database. One of the most important steps for extracting such records is identifying, among different data regions from a page, one that contains the records to be extracted. An incorrect identification of this region may lead to an incorrect extraction of the search result records. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient method that generates path expression to select the main data region from a given page, based on the rendering area information of its elements. The generated path expression may be used by wrappers for extracting the search result records and its data units, reducing its complexity and increasing its accuracy.

Several techniques have been proposed in literature to improve test conditions on the field, based either on analog and digital approaches. More recently, wavelets and their derivatives have shown to be very effective for the processing of PD signals due to their potential to identify transient, time-localized signals. This paper presents the development and results of a new technique to denoise PD signals based on data mining concepts applied to Undecimated Wavelet Transform (UWT) modulus maxima lines propagation. The theory of modulus maxima lines is introduced and their use is justified as an effective way to identify and localize PD pulses. The UWT was employed as a way to increase robustness against the effects of decimation, which is a characteristic of the orthogonal Wavelet Transform that causes random losses of PD pulses. We took advantage of the improved UWT capability to recover signals by using a modified version of the cycle spinning approach. Denoising was performed by separating the maxima lines related to PDs from those related to noise, followed by reconstruction using the inverse UWT. Separation was achieved by the use of data mining tools. The performances of several algorithms were evaluated and compared, including investigations regarding statistically divergent noise types, effects of data pre-processing like normalization and cleansing, procedures for training and comparisons of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Results obtained for both simulated and measured PD signals confirm that the approach is superior when compared to standard linear filters and non-linear wavelet-based techniques. This is particularly noticeable when processing non-stationary time-localized interferences, a situation in which these techniques fail completely. © 2014 IEEE.","data mining; denoising; measurement; partial discharges; wavelets","Data mining; Filtration; Measurements; Partial discharges; Wavelet transforms; De-noising; High voltage facility; On-line partial discharge; Orthogonal wavelet transforms; Partial discharge signal; Undecimated wavelet transform; Unsupervised techniques; wavelets; Signal denoising",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479927876,,,"English","EIC - Proc.

However, the literature appears not to include methods or techniques for exploring databases to obtain classifications for this quality; nor is there a consensus as to the definition of “education quality”. To address these issues, this article proposes a methodology similar to the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) to classify Education Quality in schools comparatively, based on grades scored in school performance tests. For the purposes of this study, the test used was the Prova Brasil examination, which is part of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) used in Brazil. The methodology was applied to public municipal schools in the town of Araucária in the metropolitan district of Curitiba in Paraná State. Seventeen schools that offer elementary and junior high school education were included. All the grades of every student were considered from the early and later years at the schools. During the Data Mining stage, the main stage of the KDD process, three comparative methods were used for Pattern Recognition: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Genetic Algorithms. These methods supplied satisfactory results in the classification of schools represented by way of a “Quality Label”, with Artificial Neural Networks having the best performance for the problem in question. With this quality label, educational managers can decide on which measures to adopt at all the schools to help them achieve their goals. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Education quality; KDD process; Pattern recognition; Real case study","Classification (of information); Data mining; Managers; Manufacture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Societies and institutions; Basic educations; Comparative methods; Education quality; Junior high schools; Knowledge discovery in database; Quality labels; Real case; School performance tests; Education","Góes, A.R.; Federal University of Parana (UFPR)Brazil","Kuroda S.I.Zheng L.Liu H.","Trans Tech Publications Ltd",16609336,,,,"English","Appl.

Educators quickly realized the benefits of such tools for learners, allowing them to work online, to share their knowledge and help each other. Distance learning is a key concept in today's educational research; collaborative learning environments are becoming widespread, being more dynamic and resourceful. However, distance learning also introduced a series of problems, such as high evasion rates resulting from lack of support and personalized feedback. It has also introduced difficulties for educators to follow and reviews students' assignments. Based on this scenario, the work presented here proposes the development of a pedagogical agent supported by an intelligent tutoring system to provide students and teachers with assistance in order to minimize some of these problems. The use of a pedagogical agent allows students to have a constant feedback and guidance based on the identification of problems that may emerge from an online collaborative writing activity. The presence of this agent is intended to help students coordinate their efforts in writing a text collaboratively, and improve their work in terms of coherence. Furthermore, the pedagogical agent is also be able to assist teachers, reporting problems and simplifying their tasks related to the analysis of the work produced by each student. To support our pedagogical agent we propose the use of data mining tools to extract information related to the students' writings, and a recommender system to suggest additional resources.","Collaborative; Data mining; Distance learning; Intelligent tutoring system; Pedagogical agent","Computer aided instruction; Distance education; Education; Education computing; Hypertext systems; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Collaborative; Collaborative learning environment; Collaborative writing; Educational research; Extract informations; Intelligent tutoring system; Pedagogical agents; Personalized feedback; Data mining",,"da Silva A.S.Trattner C.Cena F.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925660917

Although there are plenty of techniques to handle this problem, most of them are too simplistic to provide a good estimation for absent attribute values. A very active research area focuses on solving the missing attribute value problem via imputation methods, which replaces missing data with substituted values. This paper proposes a new imputation method which uses a special graph named Complete p-Partite Attribute-based Decision Graphs (CpP-AbDG) to estimate, in a consistent and plausible way, the missing values. The graph is built by considering the range of each attribute that describes the data divided into sub-intervals; sub-intervals are approached as the vertices of a graph. Edges are then established between pairs of different vertices, provided they do not related to the same attribute. The edges and vertices are finally assigned a weight, based on distributions of the classes. The resulting CpP-AbDG has shown to be a suitable and informative data structure for finding the proper interval in which a missing attribute value should lie, taking into account all the attributes that describe the data. Results comparing the proposed approach to classical ones in an computational environment that considers classification problems as an evaluation criteria, show the potential of the method. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Attribute values; Attribute-based; Computational environments; Decision graphs; Evaluation criteria; Imputation methods; Missing data; Missing values; Data mining","Bertini, J.R.; Computer Science Department of the Computing and Mathematical Sciences Institute, University of Säo PauloBrazil",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479914845,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908485862

However, for several domains, the available data is unlabeled and the generation of a class label for each instance may have a high cost. An alternative to reduce this cost is the use of active learning, which selects instances according to a criterion of relevance. Diverse sampling strategies for active learning, following different paradigms, can be found in the literature. However, there is no detailed comparison between these strategies and they are usually evaluated for only one classification technique. In this paper, strategies from different paradigms are experimentally compared using different learning algorithms and datasets. Additionally, a multiclass hypothesis space search called SG-multi is proposed and empirically shown to be feasible. Experimental results show the effectiveness of active learning and which classification techniques are more suitable to which sampling strategies. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","active learning; classification; machine learning","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Active Learning; Active learning strategies; Class labels; Classification technique; Data mining tasks; Hypothesis space; Predictive models; Sampling strategies; Artificial intelligence",,,"Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319076164,,,"English","Lect.

Taking Alibaba as an example, the more efficient method of operation is to collect hosting service fees from the vendors that use the platform. The platform defines a service fee value and the vendors can decide whether to accept or not. In this sense, it is necessary to create an analytical tool to improve and maximize the profitability of this partnership. This work proposes a dynamic in-cooperative E-Commerce Game Model (E-CGM). In E-CGM, the platform hosting company and the e-commerce vendors have their payoff functions calculated using backwards induction and their activities are simulated in a game where the goal is to achieve the biggest payoff. Taking into consideration various market conditions, E-CGM obtains the Nash equilibrium and calculates the value for which the service fee would yield the most profitable result. By comparing the data mining results obtained from a set of real data provided by Alibaba, E-CGM simulated the expected transaction volume based on a selected service fee. The results demonstrate that the proposed model using game theory is suitable for e-commerce studies and can help improve profitability for the partners of an online business model.

The MarcoCivil platform at the ""Digital Culture"" website creaed initiatives to spread the discussions online: a Twitter profile @MarcoCivil (run by the administrators of the platform) and the MarcoCivil hashtag. To conduct the Marco Civil cartography we chose to work with the messages indexed to the MarcoCivil hashtag circulating on Twitter. In 2012 and 2013 Twitter became the online space in which cyber activists were most vocal. From October 2012 to January 2013 , we collected about 21.997 tweets related to Marco Civil, it was then that we noticed the presence of a controversy and a diversity of points of view in dispute. News reports in Brazilian newspapers during the discussion, little took into consideration the issues engendered in the struggle for approval of the law. By demonstrating with graphs the dispute between the different actors involved in this battle, we seek to contribute to the history of the approval of the Marco Civil.

Information fused from sensors and data mining analysis has recently attracted the attention of the research community for real-world applications. In this sense, the deployment of an Intelligent Offshore Oil Industry Environment will help to figure out a risky scenario based on the events occurred in the past related to anomalies and the profile of the current employee (role, location, etc.). In this paper we propose an information fusion model for an intelligent oil environment in which employees are alerted about possible risk situations while their are moving around their working place. The layered architecture, implements a reasoning engine capable of intelligently filtering the context profile of the employee (role, location) for the feature selection of an inter-transaction mining process. Depending on the employee contextual information he will receive intelligent alerts based on the prediction model that use his role and his current location. This model provides the big picture about risk analysis for that employee at that place in that moment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","context; data mining; Information fusion; oil industry; ontologies","Data mining; Multi agent systems; Ontology; Sensors; context; Contextual information; High-level information fusion; Information fusion models; Layered architecture; Off-shore oil industry; Oil industries; Research communities; Information fusion",,,"Springer Verlag",18650929,9783319077666,,,"English","Commun.

Therefore structural genomics efforts to identify the functions of hypothetical proteins have brought advances in our understanding of biological systems. To this end, a new strategy to mine protein databases in the search for candidates for function prediction was here described. The strategy was applied to Escherichia coli proteins deposited in the NCBI's non-redundant database. Briefly, data mining selects small conserved hypothetical proteins without significant templates on Protein Data Bank, without transmembrane regions and with similarity to Eukaryote proteins. Through this strategy, 12 protein sequences were selected for molecular modelling, from a total of 13,306 E. coli's conserved hypothetical sequences. From these, only three sequences could be modelled. GI 488361128 model was similar to cupredoxins, GI 281178323 model was similar to β-barrel proteins and GI 227886634 model showed structural similarities to lipid binding proteins. However, only the GI 227886634 seems to have a function related to the similar structures, since it was the unique structure that kept the fold during the molecular dynamics simulation. The method here described can be relevant to select hypothetical sequences that can be targets for in vitro and/or in vivo functional characterization. © 2014 Porto WF, et al.","Cupredoxins; Function prediction; Lipid binding proteins; Molecular modelling; Structural genomics; β-barrel proteins","Escherichia coli protein; phospholipase; algorithm; amino acid sequence; article; data mining; molecular dynamics; molecular model; prediction; protein analysis; Protein Data Bank; protein function; protein interaction; protein secondary structure; scoring system; sequence alignment; simulation","Franco, O.

On May 12, 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 7.9 on the Richter scale occurred in the Wenchuan area of Sichuan province in China. This event, together with subsequent aftershocks, caused many avalanches, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and quake lakes and induced numerous unstable slopes. This work proposes a methodology that uses a data mining approach and geographic information systems to predict these mass movements based on their association with the main and aftershock epicenters, geologic faults, riverbeds, and topography. A dataset comprising 3,883 mass movements is analyzed, and some models to predict the location of these mass movements are developed. These predictive models could be used by the Chinese authorities as an important tool for identifying risk areas and rescuing survivors during similar events in the future. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Earthquake; Geographic information systems; Mass movements","Catastrophic consequences; Data-based modeling; Geologic faults; Mass movement; Predictive models; Richter scale; Sichuan , China; Sichuan province; Data mining; Geographic information systems; Neural networks; Earthquakes; aftershock; artificial neural network; catastrophic event; data mining; earthquake epicenter; earthquake magnitude; earthquake trigger; GIS; mass movement; article; China; data mining; earthquake; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; geographic information system; mass movement; prediction; statistical analysis; statistical model; China; Sichuan","De Souza, F.T.; Postgraduate Program in Urban Management (PPGTU), Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná (PUC-PR), Polytechnic School and School of Architecture and Design, Rua Imaculada Conceição-1155-Prado Velho, 80215-901 Curitiba Paraná, Brazil; email: fabio.teodoro@pucpr.br",,,01676369,,EMASD,,"English","Environ.

In this work we propose a new deep convolutional neural network that exploits from character- To sentence-level information to perform sentiment analysis of short texts. We apply our approach for two corpora of two different domains: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SSTb), which contains sentences from movie reviews; and the Stanford Twitter Sentiment corpus (STS), which contains Twitter messages. For the SSTb corpus, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for single sentence sentiment prediction in both binary positive/negative classification, with 85.7% accuracy, and fine-grained classification, with 48.3% accuracy.

One key problem that has attracted researchers interest is Topicbased Influence Maximization, that refers to finding a small set of users on a social network that have the ability to influence a substantial portion of users on a given topic. The proposed solutions, however, are not suitable for large-scale social networks and must incorporate mechanisms for determining social influence among users on each topic of interest. Consequently, for these approaches, it becomes difficult or even unfeasible to deal quickly and efficiently with constant changes in the structure of social networks. This problem is particularly relevant as the topics of interest of users and the social influence they exert on each other for every topic are considered together. In this work, it is proposed a scalable solution, that makes use of data mining over an information propagation log, in order to directly select the initial set of influential users on a particular topic without the need to incorporate a previous step for learning users social influence with regard to that topic. As an additional benefit, the targeted seed set also offers an approximation guarantee of the optimal solution. Finally, it is presented a design of experiments over a data set containing information propagation data from a real social network. As main results, we have found some evidences that the proposed solution maintains a trade-off between scalability and accuracy.

This paper presents a method for selection of variables for the classification of cases into two classes, benign or malignant, based on cyto-pathological analysis of breast cell samples of patients. The variables are ranked according to a new index of importance of variables that combines the weighting importance of Principal Component Analysis and the explained variance based on each retained component. Observations from the test sample are categorized into two classes using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Discriminant Analysis, followed by elimination of the variable with the index of lowest importance. The subset with the highest accuracy is used to classify observations in the test sample. When applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database, the proposed method led to average of 97.77% in classification accuracy while retaining an average of 5.8 variables.","Breast cancer identification; Discriminant analysis; K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN); Selection of variables","Breast Neoplasms; data mining; early diagnosis; female; human; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Breast Neoplasms; Data Mining; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans",,,"Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva",14138123,,,"24820612","English; Portuguese","Cienc.

Among the challenges generated by this ""data deluge"" is the development of efficient knowledge discovery strategies. Here, we show that statistical and computational tools used to analyze large data sets of genome-wide studies can be fruitfully applied to a climatic context. Although not as powerful as some techniques already in use by climatologists, these tools are simple and robust, and can easily be adapted to detect early warning signals for extreme events like droughts or be used to filter large data sets before applying other more advanced and computationally expensive methods. We test this approach in our investigation of the causes of the Amazon droughts of 2005 and 2010. Our results highlight the major role played in these extreme events by the warming of the sea's surface temperature, mainly in the tropical North Atlantic. Our findings are in agreement with several analyses published in the literature. The main message we convey is that free and open-source data mining and visualization techniques routinely used in genetic studies can be useful in helping scientists to extract knowledge from large climatic data sets, particularly in regions of the world that are vulnerable to climate change but where the availability of technical expertise is critically scarce. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Drought; Genes; Analysis approach; Climatological data; Computational tools; Genetic studies; Knowledge extraction; Surface temperatures; Technical expertise; Visualization technique; Data mining; climate modeling; climatology; data set; drought; extreme event; genome; statistical analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)","M.

We focus our analysis on molecular docking data obtained from application of differential evolution implemented in the program Molegro Virtual Docker. As a protein target, we selected the enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQD). This enzyme is part of the shikimate pathway, and a protein target for development of anti-tubercular drugs. We used a set with 20 DHQD crystallographic structures with ligands bound to the active site. In order to identify the best approach to molecular docking, we analyzed crystallographic parameters and looked for correlation between the docking results and structural features present in the protein target. Analysis of docking results helps to identify the best approach to use in ligand docking and identify structural features important for the success of this methodology. Analysis of results generated by ligand docking focused on DHQD made possible to assess the best docking protocol for this enzyme and use this optimized approach in the more computational demanding methodology of virtual screening (VS).

For this purpose, a flexible structure is equipped with acceleration transducers at each degree of freedom and a force transducer for validation and training. The models are trained using data obtained from applying a random excitation force on the flexible structure. The performance of the developed models is evaluated by analyzing the prediction capabilities based on a normalized prediction error. The frequency domain is considered to analyze the similarity of the frequencies in the predicted and the original force signal. For a selection of the best models, a more advanced performance analysis is carried out. This includes application of the trained models to deterministic and non-deterministic excitation forces with different excitation frequencies and amplitudes. Additionally, the influence of the sampling frequency and sensor location on the model performance is investigated. The results obtained in this paper show that most data mining approaches can be used, when a certain degree of inaccuracy is accepted. Furthermore, the comparison study points out that the transducer location is crucial for the model performance. However, there exists no general solution for the final selection of models.

These media constitute a rich source for sentiment analysis and understanding of the opinions spontaneously expressed. The traditional techniques for sentiment analysis are based on POS Tagger and its usage ends up being too costly when considering the Portuguese language, due to the complex grammatical structure of this language. Faced with such problem, this paper presents a case study carried out in order to evaluate a technique developed for sentiment analysis based on Bayesian Classifiers. Although our technique could be applied to any language, the present study focused on tweets posted in Portuguese during the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Among them, cluster detection techniques are of major importance. Although these techniques have already been largely explored in the scientific literature, there are at least two important open issues: the existent algorithms are not scalable for large high-dimensional datasets, and the unsupervised nature of traditional data clustering makes it very difficult to generate meaningful clusters. This article presents an overview of the strategies being explored in order to deal more deeply with these issues. Moreover, it describes a new semi-supervised clustering strategy that exemplifies the integration of several approaches and that can be employed with partitioning algorithms, such as PAM and Clarans. The technique addresses an improvement to these types of algorithms, which is obtained by using must-link feedback information provided by the users in an interactive and visual environment. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Cluster analysis; Cluster detection; Clustering methods; Feed back information; Knowledge discovery in database; Partitioning algorithms; Scientific literature; Semi-supervised Clustering; Visual environments; Clustering algorithms","Razente, H.; Computer Science Department, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia - UFU, Uberlandia, Brazil; email: humberto@facom.ufu.br",,"Wiley-Blackwell",19424787,,,,"English","Wiley Interdiscip.

This paper introduces an incremental fuzzy modeling approach based on uncertain data streams. By uncertain data we mean data originated from unreliable sensors, imprecise perception, or description of the value of a variable represented as a fuzzy interval. An online incremental learning algorithm is used to develop the antecedent part of functional fuzzy rules and the rule base that assembles the model. A recursive least squares-like algorithm updates the parameters of a discrete state-space representation of the fuzzy rule consequents.

Further, opinions are subjective expressions that describe people's viewpoints, perspectives or feelings about entities, events and theirs properties. Detecting subjective expressions is the task of identifying whether a given text is subjective (i.e. an opinion) or objective (i.e. a reports fact). This task is considered as the first problem and it is very important for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. This research aims to analyze publicized stream of tweets from the Twitter microblogging site. The data stream are preprocessed and classified based on their emotional content as positive, negative and neutral. The data analysis is limited to a particular set of users. Firstly, we collect and process post comments on Twitter. Then the post was analyzed by lexical and syntactic approach. In experiment results, we detects more neutral emotional states than positive or negative (31%). We also applied statistical methods in order to infer if there exist correlation between user reputation and emotional content. The finding suggest that did not exist a strong correlation between user reputation and emotional content. From our observation, user reputation do not follow any emotional rules. © 2014 AISTI.","Sentiment and opinion mining; SentiWordNet; Twitter","Information systems; Social networking (online); Syntactics; Automatic extraction; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; SentiWordNet; Strong correlation; Syntactic approach; Twitter; User reputations; Data mining",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21660727,9789899843431,,,"Spanish","Iberian Conf.

The methodology uses the KDD process (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) in order to establish a quality level to be printed in labels. The methodology was applied to feeders on a substation located in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil, considering attributes such as sag length (remnant voltage), duration and frequency (number of occurrences on a given period of time). On the Data Mining stage (the main stage on KDD Process), three different techniques were used, in a comparative way, for pattern recognition, in order to achieve the quality classification for the feeders: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). By printing a label with quality level information, utilities companies (power concessionaires) can get better organized for management and mitigation procedures by establishing clear targets. Moreover, the same way costumers already receive information regarding PQ based on interruptions, they will also be able to receive information based on voltage sags. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","KDD process; PQ classification; Quality management","Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Curitiba; Distribution systems; Knowledge discovery in database; Quality classification; Quality levels; Three different techniques; Utilities companies; Voltage sags; Quality management","Steiner, M.

In this chapter an overview is given of the sequence of experimental procedures of typical metabolomic experiments. The focus is on NMR based metabolomics, but many aspects apply to other techniques that can be used in metabolomics such as MS or HPLC. Major holdbacks are pointed out and improved protocols are suggested for the extraction of the samples and for the conversion of NMR spectra to data, which can be analyzed by multivariate analysis. For an improved coverage of the extracted metabolites a single two-phase (using immiscible solvents) extraction procedure is proposed. To minimize the overlooking of minor components in the extract a procedure for automatic reduction of NMR spectra to essential data is proposed. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Extraction; Metabolites; Multivariant analysis; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Continuous development; Experimental procedure; Experimental protocols; Extraction method; Extraction procedure; Immiscible solvents; Metabolic fingerprinting; Multi variate analysis; Data mining",,,"American Chemical Society",00976156,9780841229761,ACSMC,,"English","ACS Symp.

Despite its epidemiology is known, there are few studies about factors that cause it based on field data. This paper aimed to report influence of weather variables on rust occurrence using the decision tree technique. The models were developed based on disease detection dataset during harvests (2007/08 to 2010/11), temperature and rainfall variables at varied time windows prior to disease detection. For each disease ""occurrence"" record, a corresponding ""non-occurrence"" was generated based on the assumption that disease was not present at the thirtieth day prior to the report date, due to unfavorable weather conditions. The training set for modeling consisted of 45 rainfall and temperature variables and 12,591 records. The chosen predictive model resulted in a decision tree with approximately 78% of accuracy and 108 rules, determined by cross-validation. The interpreted model, with 28 rules, considered the temperature variables as more important, of which temperatures below 15°C and above 30 °C were related to events of non-occurrence, while temperatures within the favorable range have been associated with events of occurrence, showing consistency with the literature.","Data mining; Decision support systems; Epidemiology; Phakopsora pachyrhizi; Plant disease forecast",,,,"Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola",01006916,,,,"Portuguese","Eng.

Considering that the chatterbots' KB might be a large collection of question-answer pairs, there is an increasing need of visual design proposals for the chatterbots' dialogues. However, there is a lack of projects related to the chatterbots' KB display. In order to fill this gap, this paper introduces a new graphical model called Dialogue Conceptual Diagram (DCD). It is a unified theoretical framework to describe the chatterbot's knowledge in a graphical, intuitive and compact way.

However, performing Sentiment Analysis on Social Media is a challenging task, since the huge volume of short textual posts and high dynamicity inherent to it pose strict requirements of efficiency and scalability. Despite all efforts, the literature still lacks proposals that address both requirements. In this sense, we propose LEGi, a corpus-based method for consolidating context-aware sentiment lexicons. It is based on a semi-supervised strategy for propagation of lexicon-semantic classes on a transition graph of terms. Empirical analyses on two distinct domains, derived from Twitter, demonstrate that LEGi outperformed four well-established methods for lexicon consolidation. Further, we found that LEGi's lexicons may improve the quality of the sentiment analysis performed by a traditional method in the literature. Thus, our results point out LEGi as a promising method for consolidating lexicons in high demanding scenarios, such as Social Media.

SToC post-processes the output of a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method in order to determine which latent factors should be further merged to improve cohesion.

The genetic regulators of these processes were investigated in petunia by in silico analyses and the sequence information was used to devise a reverse genetics approach to probe mutant populations. Petunia orthologs of photoreceptor, light-signaling components and anthocyanin metabolism genes were identified and investigated for functional conservation by phylogenetic and protein motif analyses. The expression profiles of photoreceptor gene families and of transcription factors regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis were obtained by bioinformatic tools. Two mutant populations, generated by an alkalyting agent and by gamma irradiation, were screened using a phenotype-independent, sequence-based method by high-throughput PCR-based assay.

However, there aren't sufficient human resources to produce that knowledge at the same rate of its demand. Considering the Portuguese language, which has few resources in the semantic area, the situation is even more alarming. Aiming to solve that problem, this work investigates how some semantic relations can be automatically extracted from Portuguese texts. The two main approaches investigated here are based on (i) textual patterns and (ii) machine learning algorithms. Thus, this work investigates how and to which extent these two approaches can be applied to the automatic extraction of seven binary semantic relations (is-a, part-of, location-of, effect-of, property-of, made-of and used-for) in Portuguese texts. The results indicate that machine learning, in particular Support Vector Machines, is a promising technique for the task, although textual patterns presented better results for the used-for relation.","Information extraction; Semantic relation extraction; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Automatic extraction; Computational applications; Portuguese languages; Semantic knowledge; Semantic relation extractions; Semantic relations; Text mining; Textual patterns; Semantics",,"Calzolari N.Choukri K.Goggi S.Declerck T.Mariani J.Maegaard B.Moreno A.Odijk J.Mazo H.Piperidis S.Loftsson H.","European Language Resources Association (ELRA)",,9782951740884,,,"English","Int.

In this paper we propose solutions to acquire labels and cope with concept drift in this setting, by using findings from social psychology on how humans prefer to disclose some types of emotions. In particular, we use findings that humans are more motivated to report positive feelings rather than negative feelings and also prefer to report extreme feelings rather than average feelings. We map each of these self-report imbalances on two machine learning sub-tasks. The preference on the disclosure of positive feelings can be explored to generate labeled data on polarizing topics, where a positive event for one group usually induces negative feelings from the opposing group, generating an imbalance on user activity that unveils the current dominant sentiment. Based on the knowledge that extreme experiences are more reported than average experiences, we propose a feature representation strategy that focus on terms which appear at spikes in the social stream. When comparing to a static text representation (TF-IDF), we found that our feature representation is more capable of detecting new informative features that capture the sudden changes on sentiment stream caused by real-world events. We show that our social psychology-inspired framework produces accuracies up to 84% while analyzing live reactions in the debate of two popular sports on Twitter - soccer and football - despite requiring no human effort in generating supervisory labels. © 2014 ACM.","sentiment analysis; social media analytics; stream data mining","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Sports; Websites; Concept drifts; Feature representation; Positive feelings; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Social psychology; Stream data mining; Text representation; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450323512,,,"English","WSDM - Proc.

In tweet sentiment analysis, opinions in messages can be typically categorized as positive or negative. To classify them, researchers have been using traditional classifiers like Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this paper, we show that a SVM classifier combined with a cluster ensemble can offer better classification accuracies than a stand-alone SVM. In our study, we employed an algorithm, named C3E-SL, capable to combine classifier and cluster ensembles. This algorithm can refine tweet classifications from additional information provided by clusterers, assuming that similar instances from the same clusters are more likely to share the same class label. The resulting classifier has shown to be competitive with the best results found so far in the literature, thereby suggesting that the studied approach is promising for tweet sentiment classification. © 2014 IEEE.","Classification; Cluster Ensemble; Clustering; Support Vector Machines; Tweet Sentiment Analysis","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Classification and clustering; Cluster ensembles; Clustering; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Source material; SVM classifiers; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479956180,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Many computational methodologies and algorithms have been proposed as a solution to the 3-D Protein Structure Prediction (3-D-PSP) problem. These methods can be divided in four main classes: (a) first principle methods without database information; (b) first principle methods with database information; (c) fold recognition and threading methods; and (d) comparative modeling methods and sequence alignment strategies. Deterministic computational techniques, optimization techniques, data mining and machine learning approaches are typically used in the construction of computational solutions for the PSP problem.

They employ a database formed by historical input (precipitation and streamflow) and output (streamflow) variables to perform the prediction. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most common types of DDMs, and are typically more accurate than other empirical models, but have the disadvantage of not being sufficiently transparent. One of the machine-learning methods that do not have this problem is the so-called ""instance-based learning"" (IBL). The KNN algorithm is an example of IBL. This research applies and proposes variations of the KNN model in order to forecast streamflows in a river of the state of Sergipe, Brazil.

Studying such data aims at better understanding the behaviour of this disease to prevent the dengue propagation. For instance, it may be the case that the number of cases of dengue fever in cities depends on many factors, such as climate conditions, density, sanitary conditions. Experts are interested in using geographical information systems in order to visualize knowledge on maps. For this purpose, we propose to build maps based on gradual patterns. Such maps provide a solution for visualizing for instance the cities that follow or not gradual patterns. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Data Mining; Epidemiological Data; Geographic Information Systems; Gradual Patterns","Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Climate condition; Dengue fevers; Epidemiological Data; Gradual Patterns; Vector-borne disease; Geographic information systems",,,"Springer Verlag",18650929,9783319088549,,,"English","Commun.

A context-aware recommender system makes recommendations by incorporating available contextual information into the recommendation process. One of the major challenges in context-aware recommender systems research is the lack of automatic methods to obtain contextual information for these systems. Considering this scenario, in this paper, we propose to use contextual information from topic hierarchies to improve the performance of context-aware recommender systems. Three different types of topic hierarchies are constructed by using the LUPI-based Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method: a topic hierarchy using only a traditional bag-of-words, a second topic hierarchy using a bag-of-words of named entities and a third topic hierarchy using both information. We evaluate the contextual information in four context-aware recommender systems. The empirical results demonstrate that by using topic hierarchies we can provide better recommendations. © 2014 IEEE.","Context-Aware Recommender Systems; Named Entities; Recommender Systems; Text Mining; Topic Hierarchy","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Automatic method; Bag of words; Context-aware recommender systems; Contextual information; Hierarchical clustering methods; Named entities; Text mining; Topic hierarchy; Information use",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479956180,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Their advances can be assessed using patent indicators and text mining techniques. The aim of this study was at analyzing the advances in nanocellulose based on indicators compiled from patents filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 2000 to 2012. Assignees, technological subjects, highly cited patents, applications and types of nanocellulose were obtained by mining structured and unstructured data. The results highlighted the different interests in the USA market, mainly after 2007. Mined terms from titles and abstracts could add further information to the analysis. However, although the method applied was useful, it was not sufficient to identify all applications and types of nanocellulose involved in the sample analyzed, therefore it is recommended that other document parts be included in future analyses.","Data mining; Patent analysis; Sustainability; Technological mapping; Text mining","Cellulose; Commerce; Patents and inventions; Sustainable development; Nano-cellulose; Patent analysis; Patent documents; Text mining; Text mining techniques; United States Patent and Trademark Office; Unstructured data; Data mining",,,"Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos",15161439,,,,"English","Mater.

These channels are being used as a rich data source for monitoring different real world events such as natural disasters and disease outbreaks, to name a few. However, depending on the event being investigated, this monitoring may be severely affected by data scarcity and noise, allowing just coarse grain analysis in terms of time and space, which lack the specificity necessary for supporting actions at the local level. In this context, we present a methodology to handle data scarcity and noise while monitoring real world events using social media data in a fine grain. We apply our methodology to dengue-related data from Brazil, and show how it could improve significantly the performance of event monitoring at a local scale almost doubling the correlation observed in some cases. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Data mining; Dengue; Disease surveillance; Social media","Data mining; Disasters; Social networking (online); Coarse-grain analysis; Dengue; Disease outbreaks; Disease surveillance; Event monitoring; Natural disasters; Social media; Social media datum; Data handling",,,"Springer Verlag",03029743,,,,"English","Lect.

The data was collected after the end of the course, and concerned the students' interactions with the learning environment's educational resources, that were represented and stored using ontologies, and used by the Pedagogical Recommendation Process. This process aims to detect pedagogical practices happening in the classroom, discover the patterns responsible for these practices, create recommendations to improve the students' performance, and monitor and evaluate if the process is working appropriately. In the end of the analysis, we identified that a considerable amount of dropouts, and other students who were very close to approval, failed.

However, qualitative analysis is a laborious, time-consuming and subjective process. Aim: The authors propose the use of visualization and text mining to improve the qualitative analysis process. The objective of this paper is to explain how the use of visualization can support the Coding in multiple documents simultaneously, which may allow codes standardization thus making the process more efficient. Method: The Insight tool is being developed to make the proposal feasible and a feasibility study was performed to verify if the proposal offers benefits to the process and improves its results. Results: The study shows that the subjects who applied the proposal got more standardized codes and were more efficient than the ones who applied the process manually. Conclusions: The results derived from the use of visualization and text mining, even in a feasibility study, encourage proceeding with the project, which aims to combine both techniques to obtain more benefits on qualitative analysis conduction.

These approaches usually consider static and dynamic source code analysis for relearning of these models. However, business processes have components that cannot be directly extracted by static analysis (i.e., process participants and concurrent tasks). Moreover, most of well-known process mining algorithms used in dynamic analysis do not support all required operations of incremental extraction. Re-learning of large legacy systems can benefit from an incremental analysis strategy in order to provide iterative extraction of process models. This paper discusses an approach for business knowledge extraction from legacy systems through incremental process mining.

However, educational forums, along several others online educational environments, often suffer from topic disruption. Since the contents are mainly produced by participants (in our case learners), one or few individuals might change the course of the discussions. Thus, realigning the discussed topics of a forum thread is a task often conducted by a tutor or moderator. In order to support learners and tutors to harmonically align forum discussions that are pertinent to a given lecture or course, in this paper, we present a method that combines semantic technologies and a statistical method to find and expose relevant topics to be discussed in online discussion forums.

This expansion has been accompanied by some inherent difficulties, such as: steady expansion of system capacity and energy efficiency. With the idea of increasing Green Networks concept, focuses on the attempt to reduce energy and CO2 emissions. Thus, this paper proposes to implement a model of a validation policy based on the Markov decision process to optimize energy consumption and quality of service, by allocating users in macrocell and femtocell networks. This model was inserted into the NS-2 simulator, and combined an analytical solution with the characteristic flexibility of the Markov discrete-event simulation.

Questions submitted by physicians and their respective answers in the Brazilian health ministry telehealth platform were mined using a text mining tool. Graphs about the concepts present in the database were extracted using this tool, which gave a clearer view of the subjects addressed by teleconsultants. A questionnaire has been given to teleconsultants asking them about the current protocol they follow in their answering process in the TelehealthRS Project. Results showed that the graphs obtained in the mining process can make teleconsultation answering easier. A recorded interview was conducted with nine physician teleconsultants, deepening the first questionnaire topics.

Different types of soil can be identified by means of these features. A good soil classification is very important to get a better use of the soil. Soil classification, when performed manually by experts, is not a simple task, as long as the experts opinions may vary considerably. Besides, different types of soil cannot be defined deterministically. With the objective of exploring an alternative approach towards solving this problem, we investigated in this paper the application of an automatic procedure to generate a soil classifier from data, using a fuzzy decision tree induction algorithm. In order to compare the results obtained by means of the fuzzy decision tree classifier, we used two well known methods for classifiers generation: the classic decision tree induction algorithm C4.5 and the fuzzy rules induction algorithm named FURIA. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","classification; decision tree; fuzzy decision tree; fuzzy rule based systems; soil classification; soil classification system","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Fuzzy rules; Knowledge based systems; Soils; Automatic procedures; Decision tree induction; Fuzzy decision tree induction; Fuzzy decision trees; Qualitative features; Rules induction; Soil classification; Data mining",,,"Springer Verlag",18650929,9783319087948,,,"English","Commun.

However, mining this data is challenging as the available records are generally noise digitized handwritten, typewritten or press printed documents. In this research proposal, we plan to develop tools and techniques for pre-processing and extracting information from documents of the military dictatorship period that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. The data to be analyzed consists of digitized images of records from DEOPS/SP (São Paulo State Department of Political and Social Order), an emblematic police agency which have monitored (and in some cases, harassed and tortured) hundreds of thousands Brazilian citizens during that period.

While this opened the door for information extraction and mining techniques that can help us understand different aspects of society, extracting useful information from such streams ofWeb data is far from trivial. In this setting, sentiment analysis techniques can be convenient as they are capable of summarizing general feeling about entities people care about, such as products and companies. Therefore, they can be quite applicable in scenarios like the stock market, which also has tremendous impact on society.

The classification of land cover by the supervised method requires training areas, these areas must be representative of each class of land cover. For the classification decision tree (DT) algorithm, the complexity of DT, results in different values of accuracies for thematic maps. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the minimum sample density in a DT model which would allow to discriminate land cover classes, evaluate the size of the generated DT model, as well as, identify the more difficult land cover class to be mapped. Satellite images from RESOURCESAT-1as well as spectral indices were used in the study. The minimum sample density varied between 0.15 and 0.30% of the total area for each class, this sampling interval allowed better results than 80% for kappa index.

The proposed process is capable of generating information that answers questions such as: ""In the opinion of the customer, which car is better: Corsa or Palio? Which one is more beautiful? Which engine is stronger?"" To answer these questions by comparison, one can show a general view reflected on different social networks, indicating, for example, that for a given vehicle, a certain percentage of responses are considered positive, while for others, the percentage is considered negative. The results can be used for various purposes such as guiding decisions to improve the products or directing specific marketing strategies.

The experiments performed confirm that the automatically obtained fuzzy ontologies are good representation of the user's preferences. In order to test the applicability of the obtained ontologies, a text categorization experiment has been proposed and the obtained results indicate that the approach can be applied with satisfactory results and warrants further research. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Fuzzy Ontology; Text Mining; User Modeling; User Profile","Data mining; Experiments; Natural language processing systems; Rough set theory; Soft computing; Text processing; Data mining; Information filtering; Natural language processing systems; Rough set theory; Semantics; Soft computing; Text processing; Automatic construction; Automatic Generation; Fuzzy ontology; Ontological representation; Semantic representation; Text mining; User Modeling; User profile; Ontology; Ontology",,,"Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319086439,,,"English","Lect.

In recent years, these databases provide an environment to access, integrate and produce new knowledge by storing ever increasing volumes of genetic or protein data. The transformation and management of these data in a different way than from the one that were originally thought can be a challenge for research in biology. The problems appear by the lack of textual structure or appropriate markup tags. The main goal of this work is to explore the PubMed database, the main source of information about health sciences, from the National Library of Medicine. By means of this database of digital textual documents, we aim to develop a method capable of identifying protein terms that will serve as a substrate to laboratory practices for repositioning drugs. In this perspective, in this work we use text mining to extract terms related to protein names in the field of neglected diseases.

Among several reasons, the no user participation in the conceptual modelling process stands out. Another important issue is considering the need for creating a conceptual model with the integration of various viewpoints, from different stakeholders. In this context, this paper has two main goals: the first one is trying to make the modeling process more inclusive for the customers/stakeholders, during the conceptual modeling, through the adoption of cognitive models such as Mind Maps; the second one, is trying to consolidate the multiple perspectives of the resulting conceptual models (each from a different stakeholder) using merge techniques. The expected result is to obtain ubiquitous conceptual models with higher quality.","Collaborative elicitation; Conceptual modeling; Mind Maps; Requirements engineering","Data mining; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Systems engineering; Collaborative approach; Collaborative elicitation; Conceptual model; Conceptual modelling; Information Modeling; Information system development; Mind maps; Requirements elicitation; Schematic diagrams",,,"Universidad de la Frontera",,9789562362474,,,"English; Portuguese","Proc.

However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the update of SRs.

It has found application in several domains including signal processing and data mining. With the deluge of data faced in our societies, large-scale matrix and tensor factorizations become a crucial issue. Few works have been devoted to large-scale tensor factorizations. In this paper, we introduce a fully distributed method to compute the CPD of a large-scale data tensor across a network of machines with limited computation resources. The proposed approach is based on collaboration between the machines in the network across the three modes of the data tensor. Such a multi-modal collaboration allows an essentially unique reconstruction of the factor matrices in an efficient way. We provide an analysis of the computation and communication cost of the proposed scheme and address the problem of minimizing communication costs while maximizing the use of available computation resources. © 2014 IEEE.","distributed computation; large-scale data; Tensor decompositions","Cost benefit analysis; Factorization; Signal processing; Tensors; Canonical polyadic decompositions; Communication cost; Computation resources; Distributed computations; Distributed methods; Large-scale datum; Tensor decomposition; Tensor factorization; Matrix algebra",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15206149,9781479928927,IPROD,,"English","ICASSP IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process Proc",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905276058

Medical expenditure required to meet public demand for high-quality and high-technology services is substantial. This phenomenon is likely to become more widespread and more intense due to the increasing average lifespan and decreasing birth rates of humans in many societies. People rely on health insurance systems, which are either sponsored by governments or managed by the private sector, to share high healthcare costs. Performing business process analysis in healthcare organizations is particularly difficult due to the highly dynamic, complex, ad-hoc, and multi-disciplinary nature of healthcare processes. Process mining is a promising approach to obtain a better understanding of these processes by analyzing event data recorded in healthcare information systems. The goal of process mining is to use event data to extract process-related information. Taking a set of real process executions (the so-called ""event logs"") as the starting point, this approach can be used to automatically construct a process model reflecting the behavior that has been observed and recorded in the event log. The aim of the present paper is to apply a process mining approach to analyze processes of a healthcare insurance company.

Most of these algorithms are based on bag-of-words representations, which generate high dimensional data. However, just a few supervised learning methods, such as SVMs, can efficiently handle high dimensional data. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of prior polarity words (PPW) in order to create a compact and representative feature set for financial news classification. Using this approach it is possible to reduce feature sets from thousands to less than tens of features without compromising the accuracy of the text classifier. We measured accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and ROC AUC of text classifiers using PPW. Classifier using PPW was able to topping all results when compared with a wide range of feature selection methods. By adopting PPW, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes performed consistently better than using the full feature set. PPW also turned Naive Bayes comparable to SVMs, as indicated by the improved performance scores in all measures tested. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Feature selection; Knowledge engineering; Text categorization","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Knowledge engineering; Support vector machines; Text processing; Experimental evaluation; Fast and accurate algorithms; Feature selection methods; High dimensional data; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning methods; Text categorization; Text classification; Feature extraction","Campos, E.; Laboratório de Inteligência Artificial (LIA), Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Computer CollegeBrazil",,"Springer Verlag",03029743,,,,"English","Lect.

Nevertheless, AI applications have not been consolidated as standard solutions in the industry, and most common applications of AI still are case studies and pilot projects. In this work, an analysis of survey conducted on a broad group of professionals related to several E&P operations and service companies is presented. This survey captures the level of AI knowledge in the industry, the most common application areas, and the expectations of the users from AI-based solutions. It also includes a literature review of technical papers related to AI applications and trends in the market and in research and development. The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most affected by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of IA technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles. This work aims to be a guide for personnel responsible for production and asset management on how AI-based applications can add more value and improve their decision making. The results of the survey offer a guideline on which tools to consider for each particular oil and gas challenge. It also illustrates how AI techniques will play an important role in future development of information-technology (IT) solutions in the E&P industry.

In this context, it becomes important to be able to assess the client satisfaction regarding those services. The objective of this work is to propose a tool for aiding the evaluation of customer satisfaction in a Brazilian Online Job Search Company through the use of Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis, or Opinion Mining, refers to the techniques used to extract and evaluate sentiment expressed in textual data. We analyzed a database of an online job search company containing client comments collected from a service cancellation form. This database, among other parameters, has a score assigned by the client and a comment about the services. We performed the classification of the sentiment expressed in the user comments with the aid of a software written in Python, and then calculated the correlation of the sentiment score with the score assigned by the clients. The results lead to the conclusion that the use of Sentiment Analysis serves as a support tool to enrich the customer satisfaction assessment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Customer satisfaction; Opinion mining; Quality; Sentiment analysis; Services","Computer software; Customer satisfaction; Data mining; Image quality; Sales; Social networking (online); Client satisfaction; On-line service; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment scores; Services; Support tool; Textual data; Quality control","Miranda, M.D.; Universidade Nove de Julho, Industrial Engineering Post Graduation Program, Av.

The legal order can be defined as a set of norms; thus, understanding concepts of a legal norm is important to understanding other legal norms. However, this feature impairs knowledge of the law, since a thorough understanding of a norm requires a specific knowledge for understanding the dependence between legal norms. Considering the difficulty in undeciphering this knowledge, this paper highlights the importance of modeling relationships between legal norms in a civil law system. In the present paper, we propose an ontology aiming to capture a clear, concise and unambiguous view of this domain, as well as systematize and reveal the dependence between legal norms with an emphasis on relationships existing in civil law. With such an ontology, we expect to provide a shared understanding of the concepts and relationships, enabling interoperability. Due to the complexity of the domain, we developed a reference ontology written in OntoUML. In the paper, we underline the major aspects of our ontology and emphasize its potential application as a semantic reference for various civil law systems in the world.","Conceptual modeling; Legal ontologies; OntoUML","Data mining; Information systems; Ontology; Semantics; Conceptual model; Legal norms; Legal ontology; Legal ordering; Model relationships; OntoUML; Shared understanding; Specific knowledge; Laws and legislation",,"Pastor O.de Cesare S.Partridge C.Gailly F.Lycett M.Guizzardi G.Wand Y.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916201313

However, take-up and reuse is hindered by the lack of descriptive information about the nature of the data, such as their topic coverage, dynamics or evolution. To address this issue, we propose an approach for creating linked dataset profiles. A profile consists of structured dataset metadata describing topics and their relevance. Profiles are generated through the configuration of techniques for resource sampling from datasets, topic extraction from reference datasets and their ranking based on graphical models. To enable a good trade-off between scalability and accuracy of generated profiles, appropriate parameters are determined experimentally. Our evaluation considers topic profiles for all accessible datasets from the Linked Open Data cloud. The results show that our approach generates accurate profiles even with comparably small sample sizes (10%) and outperforms established topic modelling approaches. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Linked Data; Metadata; Profiling; Vocabulary of Links","Data handling; Metadata; Descriptive information; Linked Data principles; Linked datum; Linked open datum; Profiling; Scalable approach; Small Sample Size; Vocabulary of Links; Data mining",,,"Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319074429,,,"English","Lect.

The visualisation and quantification of pore size distribution by data mining and spatial variability by semi-variogams were investigated in 3D images with 60-μm spatial resolution generated by X-ray CT scan (EVS/GE MS8x-130) in soil core samples collected at different depths of a kaolinitic Red-Yellow Latosol (RYL) and a gibbsitic Red Latosol (RL) from Brazil. Greater spatial variability occurred in the horizontal direction of the 3D image, a novel finding in this area of research. The pores detected were different between the Latosols studied, mainly at 0.20-0.34m depth. The largest number (>4000) and volume (±30mm3) of pores was found in the RL. The soil classes differed in 3D pore characteristics, and this aspect may be important in the characterisation of causes of pore variability. Sphericity was similar for both soils, with greater emphasis on pore classes with a diameter <0.4mm, mainly at the 0.20-0.34m depth. A higher percentage of spheroid pores occurred in RL (±25%), whereas the platy pores were more abundant in RYL (>15%). © CSIRO 2014.","Brazil; Coffee crop; CT scan; Geostatistics; Regression models; Soil pore configuration","Computerized tomography; Crops; Minerals; Regression analysis; Soil conservation; Three dimensional; Brazil; Conservation management; Conservation tillage systems; Geo-statistics; Pore characteristics; Regression model; Soil pores; Spatial variability; Soils","Carducci, C.E.; Federal University of Santa Catarina, Curitibanos Campus (UFSC), Curitibanos, SC 89520-000, Brazil; email: elocarducci@hotmail.com",,"CSIRO",1838675X,,,,"English","Soil Res.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898453117

It is known then that there are for some time several technical approaches for integrating unstructured knowledge from diverse sources. Today's computers, increasingly fast, and the explosion of Web data and improved software techniques are opening the door to rapid progress. Scientists at universities, government labs, Google, Microsoft, IBM and elsewhere are pursuing breakthroughs together, even if they are on different paths. As recurrent difficulty in several studies there is an urgent need to solve the task of linking an entity mention in the text to the real world counterpart in the existing knowledge base (entity-linking). This task is challenging once ambiguity, textual inconsistency, and lack of knowledge of the world in the knowledge base are concerned. And although many methods have been proposed to overcome this problem with different approaches, it remains opened to the general context of unstructured knowledge sharing. Thus, the alternative proposed in this paper considers the construction of knowledge sharing in a limited scope. The research objective is sharing knowledge based on structured and unstructured knowledge from the ontology integrated with the automated and self-managed and in largescale extraction, also with the analysis of user interaction. The method is based in ""Knowledge-Discovery in Databases"" method for structured data and is intended to use ""Ontology Web Language"" as a formal language to deal with unstructured data, allied with user interactions. This work has been developed over the last two years, and this disclosure is intended to present preliminary results obtained from the use of tools for the automatic extraction and knowledge sharing.","Knowledge sharing; OWL; Semantic web; Web ontology language","Computational linguistics; Extraction; Formal languages; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Semantic Web; World Wide Web; Automatic extraction; Knowledge discovery in database; Knowledge-sharing; Ontology web language; Research objectives; Sharing knowledge; Software techniques; Web ontology language; Data mining",,"Sequeira P.Sequeira P.Vivas C.Vivas C.","Academic Conferences Limited",20488963,9781910309346; 9781910309346; 9781910309353; 9781910309353; 9781910309353; 9781910309346; 9781910309346; 9781910309346,,,"English","Proc.

This makes it difficult to understand the recorded behavior in terms of the high-level activities in the process model. Also, it makes it difficult to improve the model based on run-time data about the process. In this work we present an approach to mine mappings between the events in the log and the activities in the model. These mappings can be used to generate suggestions of how the process model can be extended in order to capture the behavior recorded in the event log. Using a real-world and publicly available event log, we show how the approach can improve the model in a stepwise manner, until it covers all the behavior recorded in the event log. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Business process modeling; Model enhancement; Process mining; Recommendation systems","Data mining; Recommender systems; Systems engineering; Business Process; Business process model; Level of abstraction; Model-based OPC; Process mining; Process model; Process Modeling; Run-time data; Mapping","Ferreira, D.R.; Universidade de Lisboa, Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)Portugal",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09259902,,JIISE,,"English","J Intell Inform Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919463389

The databases that provide the structures of the ligands are growing on a daily basis. This makes it impossible to test all the ligands for a target receptor. Hence, a ligand selection before testing the ligands is needed. One possible approach is to evaluate a set of molecular descriptors. With the aim of describing the characteristics of promising compounds for a specific receptor we introduce a data warehouse-based infrastructure to mine molecular descriptors for virtual screening (VS). We performed experiments that consider as target the receptor HIV-1 protease and different compounds for this protein. A set of 9 molecular descriptors are taken as the predictive attributes and the free energy of binding is taken as a target attribute. By applying the J48 algorithm over the data we obtain decision tree models that achieved up to 84% of accuracy. The models indicate which molecular descriptors and their respective values are relevant to influence good FEB results. Using their rules we performed ligand selection on ZINC database. Our results show important reduction in ligands selection to be applied in VS experiments; for instance, the best selection model picked only 0.21% of the total amount of drug-like ligands. © 2014 Vinicius Rosa Seus et al.",,"Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase receptor; ligand; receptor; unclassified drug; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; ligand; p16 protease, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; accuracy; article; chemical structure; classification algorithm; controlled study; data base; data mining; decision tree; experimental study; genetic algorithm; molecular docking; molecular weight; screening; support vector machine; chemical structure; chemistry; computer interface; drug screening; reproducibility; Data Mining; Decision Trees; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; HIV Protease; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Reproducibility of Results; User-Computer Interface","Machado, K.S.; Centro de Ciências Computacionais, Universidade Federal Do Rio Grande - FURG, Avenida Itália km 8 s/n, 96203-900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; email: karinaecomp@gmail.com",,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation",23146133,,,"24812613","English","BioMed Res.

This study uses multitemporal PALSAR L-band radar imagery combined with object-based image analysis, data mining techniques and field data to derive vegetation structure and inundation patterns and characterize major vegetation types in várzea forests of the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. Our results show that the combination of vegetation cover and inundation extent information can be a good indicator of the complex gradient of habitats along the floodplain. The intersection between vegetation and flood duration classes showed a wider range of combinations than suggested from field based studies. Chavascal areas—chacaracterized as a dense and species-poor shrub/tree community developing in old depressions, abandoned channels, and shallow lakes—had shorter inundation periods than the usually recognized hydroperiod of 180–240 days of flooding, while low várzea—a diverse community that have fewest and smallest species, and highest individual density and that tolerate 120–180 days of flooding every year—was distributed between flood duration ranges that were higher than reported by the literature. Forest communities growing at sites that were never mapped as flooded could indicate areas that only flood during extreme hydrological events, for short periods of time. Our results emphasize the potential contribution of SAR remote sensing to the monitoring and management of wetland environments, providing not only accurate information on spatial landscape configuration and vegetation distribution, but also important insights on the ecohydrological processes that ultimately determine the distribution of complex floodplain habitat mosaics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Amazonian várzeas; Conservation; Management; Object-oriented image analysis; Random forests; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands",,"Ferreira-Ferreira, J.; Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Mamirauá, Estrada do Bexiga, 2584, Bairro Fonte Boa, Brazil",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09234861,,WEMAE,,"English","Wetlands Ecol.

A number of different relative validity criteria have been proposed for the validation of globular, clusters. Not all data, however, are composed of globular clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms seek partitions with high density areas of points (clusters, not necessarily globular) separated by low density areas, possibly containing noise objects. In these cases relative validity indices proposed for globular cluster validation may fail. In this paper we propose a relative validation index for density-based, arbitrarily shaped clusters. The index assesses clustering quality based on the relative density connection between pairs of objects. Our index is formulated on the basis of a new kernel density function, which is used to compute the density of objects and to evaluate the within- and between-cluster density connectedness of clustering results.

A new subtyping approach is considered here.Methods: Two data mining techniques, ensemble recursive partitioning and Lasso generalized linear models (GLMs), followed by k-means cluster analysis are used to search for subtypes based on index episode symptoms predicting subsequent MDD course in the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. The WMH surveys are community surveys in 16 countries. Lifetime DSM-IV MDD was reported by 8,261 respondents. Retrospectively reported outcomes included measures of persistence (number of years with an episode, number of years with an episode lasting most of the year) and severity (hospitalization for MDD, disability due toMDD).Results: Recursive partitioning found significant clusters defined by the conjunctions of early onset, suicidality, and anxiety (irritability, panic, nervousness-worry-anxiety) during the index episode. GLMs found additional associations involving a number of individual symptoms. Predicted values of the four outcomes were strongly correlated. Cluster analysis of these predicted values found three clusters having consistently high, intermediate, or low predicted scores across all outcomes. The high-risk cluster (30.0% of respondents) accounted for 52.9-69.7% of high persistence and severity, and it was most strongly predicted by index episode severe dysphoria, suicidality, anxiety, and early onset. A total symptom count, in comparison, was not a significant predictor.Conclusions: Despite being based on retrospective reports, results suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made using data mining methods. Further studies are needed to test and expand these results with prospective data. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Anxiety/anxiety disorders; Depression; Epidemiology; Panic attacks; Suicide/selfharm","adult; anxiety; Article; chronicity; cluster analysis; disease severity; DSM-IV; dysthymia; family history; health survey; high risk population; hospitalization; human; hypersomnia; insomnia; irritability; major clinical study; major depression; mental health; mixed mania and depression; onset age; panic; prediction; predictive value; psychomotor retardation; restlessness; retrospective study; suicide; symptom; urban area; weight gain; adolescent; aged; Asia; classification; data mining; Depressive Disorder, Major; Europe; middle aged; New Zealand; Nigeria; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; Western Hemisphere; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Americas; Asia; Cluster Analysis; Data Mining; Depressive Disorder, Major; Europe; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Nigeria; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult","Kessler, R.C.; Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, 180 Longwood Avenue, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",10914269,,DEANF,"24425049","English","Depression Anxiety",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908124385

The analysis of such data (aka. sentiment analysis) is quickly becoming a key feature in recommender systems and search engines. A prominent approach to sentiment analysis is based on the application of classification techniques, that is, content is classified according to the attitude of the writer. A major challenge, however, is that Twitter follows the data stream model, and thus classifiers must operate with limited resources, including labeled data and time for building classification models. Also challenging is the fact that sentiment distribution may change as the stream evolves. In this paper we address these challenges by proposing algorithms that select relevant training instances at each time step, so that training sets are kept small while providing to the classifier the capabilities to suit itself to, and to recover itself from, different types of sentiment drifts. Simultaneously providing capabilities to the classifier, however, is a conflicting-objective problem, and our proposed algorithms employ basic notions of Economics in order to balance both capabilities. We performed the analysis of events that reverberated on Twitter, and the comparison against the state-of-the-art reveals improvements both in terms of error reduction (up to 14%) and reduction of training resources (by orders of magnitude).

As a result, the use of depth images has been shown to be an attractive alternative over color images due to its invariance to lighting conditions. However, body part detection and tracking is still a challenging problem, mainly because the shape and depth of the imaged body can change depending on the perspective. We present a hybrid approach, called M5AIE, that uses both color and depth information to perform body part detection, tracking and pose classification. We have developed a modified Accumulative Geodesic Extrema (AGEX) approach for detecting body part candidates. We also have used the Affine-SIFT (ASIFT) algorithm for feature extraction, and we have adapted the conventional matching method to perform tracking and labeling of body parts in a sequence of images that has color and depth information. The results produced by our tracking system were used with the C4.5 Gain Ratio Decision Tree, the Naïve Bayes and the KNN classification algorithms for the identification of the users pose.

A simple and reliable functional form is derived using 41 214 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10) spectroscopic sample. The method automatically dropped the u and z bands, relying only on g, r and i for the final solution. Applying this expression to other 1417 181 SDSS-DR10 galaxies, with measured spectroscopic redshifts (Zspec), we achieved a mean 〈 (Zphot - Zspec)/(1 + Zspec)〉 ≲ 0.0086 and a scatter σ(Zphot-Zspec)/(1+Zspec) ≲ 0.045 when averaged up to z ≲ 1.0. The method was also applied to the PHAT0 data set, confirming the competitiveness of our results when faced with other methods from the literature. This is the first use of symbolic regression in cosmology, representing a leap forward in astronomy-data-mining connection. © 2014 The Authors.

Integrated high-throughput omics studies enable multifaceted views of cells, organisms, or their communities. With the advent of new post-genomics technologies, omics studies are becoming increasingly prevalent; yet the full impact of these studies can only be realized through data harmonization, sharing, meta-analysis, and integrated research. These essential steps require consistent generation, capture, and distribution of metadata. To ensure transparency, facilitate data harmonization, and maximize reproducibility and usability of life sciences studies, we propose a simple common omics metadata checklist. The proposed checklist is built on the rich ontologies and standards already in use by the life sciences community. The checklist will serve as a common denominator to guide experimental design, capture important parameters, and be used as a standard format for stand-alone data publications. The omics metadata checklist and data publications will create efficient linkages between omics data and knowledge-based life sciences innovation and, importantly, allow for appropriate attribution to data generators and infrastructure science builders in the post-genomics era. We ask that the life sciences community test the proposed omics metadata checklist and data publications and provide feedback for their use and improvement. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"biomedicine; biomics; checklist; data analysis; data processing; experimental design; funding; genomics; human; information processing; knowledge base; note; omics metadata checklist; ontology; priority journal; publication; reproducibility; Data Mining; Humans; Information Dissemination; Metagenomics; Publishing; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design","Kolker, E.; Bioinformatics and High-Throughput Analysis Laboratory, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle Children's Hospital, 1900 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101, United States; email: eugene.kolker@seattlechildrens.org",,,15362310,,OMICA,"24456465","English","OMICS J.
