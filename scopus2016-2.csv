In this context, understanding and modeling opinions, as well as opinion-leaders, have implications for several tasks, such as recommendation, advertising, brand evaluation etc. Despite the intrinsic relation between opinions and opinion-leaders, most recent works focus exclusively on either understanding the opinions, by Sentiment Analysis (SA) proposals, or identifying opinion-leaders using Influential Users Detection (IUD). This paper presents a preliminary evaluation about a combined analysis of SA and IUD. In this sense, we propose a methodology to quantify factors in real domains that may affect such analysis, as well as the potential benefits of combining SA Methods with IUD ones. Empirical assessments on a sample of tweets about the Brazilian president reveal that the collective opinion and the set of top opinion-leaders over time are inter-related. Further, we were able to identify distinct characteristics of opinion propagation, and that the collective opinion may be accurately estimated by using a few top-k opinion-leaders. These results point out the combined analysis of SA and IUD as a promising research direction to be further exploited. © 2016 IEEE.","Influential Users Detection; Sentiment Analysis","Decision making; Combined analysis; Decision making process; Empirical assessment; Influential users; Intrinsic relation; Potential benefits; Products and services; Sentiment analysis; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052066,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Sentiment analysis is one method of aggregating overall polarity (positive or negative) towards a topic. However, most sentiment analysis methods rely on text processing, thus ignoring the large amount of image data present in popular social networks. The primary aim of this study is to exploit image data in conjunction with text and to evaluate this integrated approach for sentiment analysis for transportation. This study used image, captions, and comments data from the Instagram social network that were marked as being relevant to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and attempted to predict the expressed sentiment towards this agency. A set of high-level features were extracted from images using the web-based Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. These features included the detection of faces and 86 categories which describe the images. Text features included the set of individual words and structural features. The experiment results of different machine learning techniques show a gain in precision when images and texts are combined compared to text-only approaches, thus confirming the relevance of visual content usage. The precision reaches a performance close to human classification agreement (typically approximately 80%). However, the results do not indicate that visual features are more informative than text features. © 2016 IEEE.","Classification; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Public transportation; Sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Image analysis; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; California department of transportations; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Public transportation; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Transportation agencies; Two way communications; Transportation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509018895,,,"English","IEEE Conf Intell Transport Syst Proc ITSC",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010064506

Therefore, miRNAs are involved in several biological processes, making the study of these molecules one of the most relevant topics of molecular biology nowadays. However, characterizing miRNAs in vivo is still a complex task. As a consequence, in silico methods have been developed to predict miRNA loci. A common ab initio strategy to find miRNAs in genomic data is to search for sequences that can fold into the typical hairpin structure of miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The current ab initio approaches, however, have selectivity issues, i.e., a high number of false positives is reported, which can lead to laborious and costly attempts to provide biological validation. This study presents an extension of the ab initio method miRNAFold, with the aim of improving selectivity through machine learning techniques, namely, random forest combined with the SMOTE procedure that copes with imbalance datasets. Results: By comparing our method, termed Mirnacle, with other important approaches in the literature, we demonstrate that Mirnacle substantially improves selectivity without compromising sensitivity. For the three datasets used in our experiments, our method achieved at least 97% of sensitivity and could deliver a two-fold, 20-fold, and 6-fold increase in selectivity, respectively, compared with the best results of current computational tools. Conclusions: The extension of miRNAFold by the introduction of machine learning techniques, significantly increases selectivity in pre-miRNA ab initio prediction, which optimally contributes to advanced studies on miRNAs, as the need of biological validations is diminished. Hopefully, new research, such as studies of severe diseases caused by miRNA malfunction, will benefit from the proposed computational tool. © 2016 The Author(s).","Data mining; Machine learning; MicroRNA; Pre-miRNA ab initio prediction; Random forest; Smote","Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gene expression; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Ab initio prediction; Biological validations; Computational tools; Hairpin structures; Machine learning techniques; MicroRNAs; Random forests; Smote; RNA; microRNA; animal; biology; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; devices; eukaryote; evaluation study; genetics; genome; genomics; human; machine learning; plant; procedures; Animals; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Eukaryota; Genome; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; MicroRNAs; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Plants","Cerqueira, F.R.; Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Department of InformaticsBrazil; email: fabio.cerqueira@ufv.br",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712105,,BBMIC,"28105918","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006833604

MuSSE (Multi-sized Sprite Sheet meta-data Exporter) is based on a Blob detection algorithm that incorporates a connected-component labeling system. Hence, blobs of arbitrary size can be extracted by adjusting component connectivity parameters. This image detection algorithm defines boundary blobs for each individual sprite in a sprite sheet. Every specific blob defines a sprite characteristic within the sheet: position, name and size, which allows for subsequent data specification for each blob/image.

However, the range of available NGS platforms requires different strategies and software to correctly assemble genomes. Different strategies are necessary to properly complete an assembly project, in addition to the installation or modification of various software. This requires users to have significant expertise in these software and command line scripting experience on Unix platforms, besides possessing the basic expertise on methodologies and techniques for genome assembly. These difficulties often delay the complete genome assembly projects. Results: In order to overcome this, we developed SIMBA (SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies), a freely available web tool that integrates several component tools for assembling and finishing bacterial genomes. SIMBA provides a friendly and intuitive user interface so bioinformaticians, even with low computational expertise, can work under a centralized administrative control system of assemblies managed by the assembly center head. SIMBA guides the users to execute assembly process through simple and interactive pages. SIMBA workflow was divided in three modules: (i) projects: allows a general vision of genome sequencing projects, in addition to data quality analysis and data format conversions; (ii) assemblies: allows de novo assemblies with the software Mira, Minia, Newbler and SPAdes, also assembly quality validations using QUAST software; and (iii) curation: presents methods to finishing assemblies through tools for scaffolding contigs and close gaps. We also presented a case study that validated the efficacy of SIMBA to manage bacterial assemblies projects sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM. Conclusion: Besides to be a web tool for genome assembly, SIMBA is a complete genome assemblies project management system, which can be useful for managing of several projects in laboratories.

MS/MS yields thousands of spectra in a single run which are then interpreted by software. Most of these computer programs use a protein database to match peptide sequences to the observed spectra. The peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) must also be assessed by computational tools since manual evaluation is not practicable. The target-decoy database strategy is largely used for error estimation in PSM assessment. However, in general, that strategy does not account for sensitivity. Results: In a previous study, we proposed the method MUMAL that applies an artificial neural network to effectively generate a model to classify PSMs using decoy hits with increased sensitivity. Nevertheless, the present approach shows that the sensitivity can be further improved with the use of a cost matrix associated with the learning algorithm. We also demonstrate that using a threshold selector algorithm for probability adjustment leads to more coherent probability values assigned to the PSMs. Our new approach, termed MUMAL2, provides a two-fold contribution to shotgun proteomics. First, the increase in the number of correctly interpreted spectra in the peptide level augments the chance of identifying more proteins. Second, the more appropriate PSM probability values that are produced by the threshold selector algorithm impact the protein inference stage performed by programs that take probabilities into account, such as ProteinProphet. Our experiments demonstrate that MUMAL2 reached around 15% of improvement in sensitivity compared to the best current method. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve obtained was 0.93, demonstrating that the probabilities generated by our model are in fact appropriate. Finally, Venn diagrams comparing MUMAL2 with the best current method show that the number of exclusive peptides found by our method was nearly 4-fold higher, which directly impacts the proteome coverage. Conclusions: The inclusion of a cost matrix and a probability threshold selector algorithm to the learning task further improves the target-decoy database analysis for identifying peptides, which optimally contributes to the challenging task of protein level identification, resulting in a powerful computational tool for shotgun proteomics. © 2016 The Author(s).","Artificial neural network; Cost sensitive classification; Data mining; Peptide/protein identification; Phosphoproteomics; Shotgun proteomics","Bioinformatics; Computational methods; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data mining; Database systems; Inference engines; Learning systems; Mass spectrometry; Matrix algebra; Molecular biology; Neural networks; Peptides; Probability; Proteins; Area under the ROC curve; Computational tools; Cost sensitive classifications; Peptide sequences; Phosphoproteomics; Probability threshold; Shotgun proteomics; Tandem mass spectrometry; Learning algorithms; peptide; proteome; algorithm; artificial neural network; chemistry; economics; evaluation study; probability; procedures; protein database; proteomics; software; tandem mass spectrometry; Algorithms; Databases, Protein; Neural Networks (Computer); Peptides; Probability; Proteome; Proteomics; Software; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","Cerqueira, F.R.; Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Department of InformaticsBrazil; email: fabio.cerqueira@ufv.br",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712105,,BBMIC,"28105913","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006765782

Ex R. E. Fries) is an oilseed with the potential for cultivation in Brazil as a source of renewable energy in areas with tropical conditions. Crambe oil contains erucic acid, giving it economic importance for use in the electricity sector. Crambe oil can be used in insulating fluids and in the manufacture of chemical products and biodiesel without competing with human food production. As it is a new crop in Brazil, the scientific literature on crambe is still scarce. This review discusses general aspects of agricultural production and the potential applications of crambe associated mainly with the manufacture of biodiesel. The topics discussed in this review include: (i) genetic improvement of crambe; (ii) agronomic practices of production, pests, diseases, harvesting, storage, and economic viability; (iii) industrial use of crambe oil as an electrical insulator and in biodiesel; (iv) detoxification of the co-product generated during oil extraction for use in animal feed and use of the co-product in the natural bioremediation of contaminants; and (v) the challenges of increasing crambe production. Crambe has a remarkable future as a source of renewable energy in Brazil.

There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets.

In Brazil, the usual method for estimating the consumption of electrical materials relies on constant rates per electrical points, incurring in large estimation errors. Furthermore, these rates can only be used in advanced project phases. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the consumption of electrical materials, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), by using information from early project stages. A dataset with project attributes was used to construct the ANN estimation models. In order to evaluate these new models, their estimates were compared to results from linear regression and constant rate models. Results showed that the ANN models have better performance when compared to other methods, supporting that ANNs are well suited for nonlinear and multidimensional problems. This investigation, therefore, supports that the method proposed could also be used by construction companies for estimating the consumption of other materials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Building material consumption; Data mining; Electrical systems; Estimation; Feature selection; Information extraction; Intelligent systems","Complex networks; Construction industry; Estimation; Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Construction companies; Electrical materials; Electrical systems; Estimation models; Large estimation errors; Material consumption; Multidimensional problems; Residential building; Data mining","Milion, R.N.; Department of Civil Engineering, CCET - Federal University of São Carlos, CP 676, CEP, Brazil; email: negri.r@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09265805,,AUCOE,,"English","Autom Constr",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028253466

This analysis is performed by grouping together objects of the data that are more similar among themselves than to objects of different groups. The sampled data may be described by numerical features or by a symbolic representation, known as categorical features. These features often require a transformation into numerical data in order to be properly handled by clustering algorithms. The transformation usually assigns a weight for each feature calculated by a measure of importance (i.e., frequency, mutual information). A problem with the weight assignment is that the values are calculated with respect to the whole set of objects and features. This may pose as a problem when a subset of the features have a higher degree of importance to a subset of objects but a lower degree with another subset. One way to deal with such problem is to measure the importance of each subset of features only with respect to a subset of objects. This is known as co-clustering that, similarly to clustering, is the task of finding a subset of objects and features that presents a higher similarity among themselves than to other subsets of objects and features. As one might notice, this task has a higher complexity than the traditional clustering and, if not properly dealt with, may present an scalability issue. In this paper we propose a novel co-clustering technique, called HBLCoClust, with the objective of extracting a set of co-clusters from a categorical data set, without the guarantees of an enumerative algorithm, but with the compromise of scalability. This is done by using a probabilistic clustering algorithm, named Locality Sensitive Hashing, together with the enumerative algorithm named InClose.

However, the true public health impact of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), a common genetic disorder associated with premature cardiovascular disease, is yet to be reliably ascertained using similar approaches. The European Atherosclerosis Society FH Studies Collaboration (EAS FHSC) is a new initiative of international stakeholders which will help establish a global FH registry to generate large-scale, robust data on the burden of FH worldwide. Methods The EAS FHSC will maximise the potential exploitation of currently available and future FH data (retrospective and prospective) by bringing together regional/national/international data sources with access to individuals with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of heterozygous or homozygous FH. A novel bespoke electronic platform and FH Data Warehouse will be developed to allow secure data sharing, validation, cleaning, pooling, harmonisation and analysis irrespective of the source or format. Standard statistical procedures will allow us to investigate cross-sectional associations, patterns of real-world practice, trends over time, and analyse risk and outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause death), accounting for potential confounders and subgroup effects. Conclusions The EAS FHSC represents an excellent opportunity to integrate individual efforts across the world to tackle the global burden of FH. The information garnered from the registry will help reduce gaps in knowledge, inform best practices, assist in clinical trials design, support clinical guidelines and policies development, and ultimately improve the care of FH patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Cardiovascular disease; Familial hypercholesterolaemia; Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Studies Collaboration; LDL-Cholesterol; Registry; Study design","Article; computer security; data base; familial hypercholesterolemia; human; information dissemination; information processing; interpersonal communication; medical ethics; medical information; medical society; methodology; patient care; priority journal; access to information; clinical trial; cooperation; data mining; genetics; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; information retrieval; integrated health care system; international cooperation; methodology; mortality; multicenter study; organization; organization and management; practice gap; register; treatment outcome; Access to Information; Cooperative Behavior; Data Mining; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Information Storage and Retrieval; International Cooperation; Organizational Objectives; Professional Practice Gaps; Registries; Research Design; Treatment Outcome","Vallejo-Vaz, A.J.; Imperial Centre for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Dept. of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, Reynolds Building, St Dunstan's Road, United Kingdom; email: a.vallejo-vaz@imperial.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",15675688,,ASTUC,"27939304","English","Atheroscler.

Such systems rely on feature extraction to provide meaningful information and representation of shapes and images. However, accurate feature extraction is not a trivial task since it may depend on parameter adjustment, application domain and the shape data set itself. Indeed, there is a demand for computational tools to understand and support parameter adjustment and therefore unfold shape description representation, since manual parameter choices may not be suitable for real applications. Our major contribution is the definition of an evolutionary optimization methodology that fully supports parameter adjustment of a multiscale shape descriptor for feature extraction and representation of leaf shapes in a high dimensional space. Here, intelligent evolutionary optimization methods search for parameters that best fit the normalized multiscale bending energy descriptor for leaf shape retrieval and classification. The simulated annealing, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization methods optimize an objective function, which is based on the silhouette measure, to achieve the set of optimal parameters. Our methodology improves leaf shape characterization and recognition due to the intrinsic shape differences which are embedded in the set of optimized parameters. Experiments were conducted on public benchmark data sets with the normalized multiscale bending energy and inner-distance shape context descriptors. The visual exploratory data analysis techniques showed that the proposed methodology minimized the total within-cluster variance and thus, improved the leaf shape clustering. Moreover, supervised and unsupervised classification experiments with plant leaves accomplished high Precision and Recall rates as well as Bulls-eye scores with the optimized parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data visualization; Evolutionary optimization; Image processing; Leaf taxonomy; Shape analysis","Computer vision; Data mining; Data visualization; Evolutionary algorithms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Object recognition; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plants (botany); Simulated annealing; Differential evolution and particle swarm optimizations; Evolutionary optimization method; Evolutionary optimizations; Exploratory data analysis; High dimensional spaces; Inner-distance shape contexts; Shape analysis; Supervised and unsupervised classification; Shape optimization","de Souza, M.M.S.; Departamento de Engenharia de Teleinformática, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Campus do Pici s/n, Bloco 725, 60455-970, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; email: marcelo@ufc.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978402456

Pattern discovery in data produced by Learning Management Systems (LMS) elicits important information about the educational process, especially when considering correlations between stakeholders interacting in different perspectives of the LMS like grades, access, forum or message communications. In this paper, we propose a data and metadata model for Learning Analytics applications using data from LMS. This model is LMS independent and supports Business Intelligence and Data Mining applications for decision-making in the educational context. Our model considers the use of historical data from LMS treated under three perspectives that can be analyzed individually or correlated. The model also allows analysis considering different stakeholders (student, educator, etc.) and levels of granularity (institution, department, course, discipline, etc.). In this sense, the proposed model allows consistent and correlated analysis of data from LMSs.

Damage caused by the spread of rumours is difficult to handle without a full understanding of the dynamics behind it. One of the central steps of understanding rumour spread is to analyze who spread rumours online, why, and how. In this research, we focus on the steps who and why by describing, implementing, and evaluating an approach that studies whether or not a group of users is actively involved in rumour discussions, and assesses rumour-spreading personality types in OSNs. We implement this general approach using Reddit data, and demonstrate its use by determining which users engage with a recurring rumour, and analyzing their comments using qualitative methods. We find that we can reliably classify users into one of three categories: (1) 'Generally support a false rumour', (2) 'Generally refute a false rumour', or (3) 'Generally joke about a false rumour'. Combining text mining techniques, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis, we aim to identify and classify those rumour-spreading user categories automatically and provide a more holistic view of rumour spread in OSNs. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Holistic view; Online social networks (OSNs); Personality types; Qualitative method; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Text mining techniques; Three categories; Social networking (online)",,"Kumar R.Caverlee J.Tong H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509028467,,,"English","Proc.

Nevertheless, even considering the efforts to reduce the number of women deaths due to problems related to pregnancy, this decrease presented less impact than other areas of human development. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, account for significant proportion of perinatal morbidity and maternal mortality. In this context, this paper proposes an inference model that uses data mining (DM) techniques capable for operating in a data set to extract patterns and assist in knowledge discovery. Identifying hypertensive crises that complicate pregnancy, it can impact in a meaningful reduction the incidence of sequelae and death of pregnant women. Comparison between two Bayesian classifiers is performed in this work to better classify the hypertensive disorders severity. Results showed that Naïve Bayes classifier had an excellent performance, presenting better precision and F-measure, compared to the other experimented classifiers. Even finding a good performance to predict hypertensive disorders, other Bayesian methods need to be evaluated, as well as other DM techniques such as those based on artificial intelligence (AI) and tree-based methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayes Methods; Data Mining; Decision Support Systems; eHealth; Hypertension; Pregnancy","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Decision support systems; Obstetrics; Bayes method; Bayesian classifier; Decision support system (DSSs); Ehealth; Hypertension; Inference mechanism; Maternal mortality; Pregnancy; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509033706,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Recent studies using non-symbolic learning algorithms have reported significant results in terms of classification accuracy. However, in applications related to decision-making processes it is necessary to understand of reasoning used in the classification process. To take this into account, the shapelet primitive has been proposed in the literature as a descriptor of local morphological characteristics. On the other hand, most of the existing work related to shapelets has been dedicated to the development of more effective approaches in terms of time and accuracy, disregarding the need for the classifiers interpretation. In this work, we propose the construction of symbolic models for time series classification using shapelet transformation. Moreover, we develop strategies to improve the representation quality of the shapelet transformation, using feature selection algorithms. We performed experimental evaluations comparing our proposal with the state-of-the-art algorithms present in the time series classification literature. Based upon the experimental results, we argue that the improvement in shapelet representation can contribute to the construction of more interpretable and competitive classifiers in comparison to non-symbolic methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data mining; Shapelets; Time series","Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision trees; Time series; Classification accuracy; Decision making process; Experimental evaluation; Feature selection algorithm; Morphological characteristic; Shapelets; State-of-the-art algorithms; Time series classifications; Data mining","Zalewski, W.; Federal University for Latin American Integration, Foz do Iguassu, Parana, Brazil; email: willian.zalewski@unila.edu.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09507051,,KNSYE,,"English","Knowl Based Syst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994073347

Even though we rely on learning algorithms to pinpoint the optimal decision boundaries in the feature space by properly detecting latent relationships among the input features, their performance is often bounded by the discriminative power of the available features. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing preprocessing methods that are capable of transforming the input data with the final goal of aiding the machine learning algorithm in building high-quality classification models. One such a method is feature construction, which is a flexible preprocessing procedure that exploits linear and nonlinear transformations of the original feature space in an attempt to capture useful information that is not explicit in the original data. Since the task of feature construction can be modelled as a heuristic search in the space of novel latent features, this paper investigates an evolutionary approach for performing such a task, namely grammatical evolution (GE). In our proposed approach, GE is employed for building an extra novel feature from the available input data in order to maximize the predictive performance of the learning algorithm in training data. Results show that many interesting implicit relationships are indeed found by the evolutionary approach, improving the performance of two well-known decision-tree induction algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational grammars; Data mining; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Input output programs; Learning systems; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Neonatal monitoring; Decision tree induction; Evolutionary approach; Grammatical evolution; Implicit relationships; Non-linear transformations; Optimal decision boundary; Pre-processing method; Predictive performance; Learning algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006229,,,"English","IEEE Congr.

The patterns can reveal tendencies, similarities and predictions, but the information is usually implicit and difficult to be validated. Classification is one of the most relevant research areas in text mining, and it usually consists of predicting the class of a textual document based on a set of documents previously organized into different classes, such as author or topic. Choosing the words to compose the feature set is crucial to a proper classification. A well selected feature set can improve the performance of the classification method and enlighten the interpretation of the classification model adjusted to the data. This paper introduces the Feature Cluster Filter (FCFilter) method for feature selection. FCFilter eliminates the need to input or optimize the number of clusters by grouping the words in a sufficiently high number of clusters. Genetic algorithms are applied to optimize the combination of groups that will provide the final feature set. The method is based on the selection of features that are good predictors for text classification by clustering features and selecting only the suitable clusters. Experiments performed to evaluate the FCFilter with the Reuters-21578, SCY-Genes and SCY-Clusters datasets showed a significant reduction in the feature-value table dimensionality with slight improvements in the classification accuracy when compared to the baselines. The results are very promising, indicating potential improvements in the research on feature selection for text mining. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Filtration; Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval systems; Text processing; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Classification models; Clustering feature; Different class; Number of clusters; Text classification; Textual documents; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006229,,,"English","IEEE Congr.

That content has commonly some metadata available that can be used to generate complex recommendation systems that track content similarity. Since there is some effort in the literature to explore this direction, almost all use classical recommendation approaches, like collaborative filter data and information present on websites that sells books. While most efforts in the literature use features derived from the text syntax to create a recommendation model, our approach aims to trace an emotional fingerprint of authors extracted from their texts. This approach, known as psychometry, consists of the study of behavioral characteristics like positivity, negativity, sadness, fear, religiosity, sexuality, which are able to disguise individuals. Using two sentiment analysis lexicons and a collection of 641 books from the English literature written by 56 authors, we show the effectiveness of these psychometric features in order to trace those authors emotional fingerprint. © 2016 ACM.","Authorship identification; Language features; Lexical semantics; Sentiment analysis","Data mining; Recommender systems; Semantics; Authorship identification; Behavioral characteristics; Content similarity; Data and information; English literature; Language features; Lexical semantics; Sentiment analysis; Electronic publishing",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450345125,,,"Portuguese","WebMedia - Proc.

While there are many studies about natural language processing of social media texts for some languages (e.g., English), the researches for Brazilian Portuguese language are still limited. Then, in this paper, a methodology is proposed to deal with peculiarities of the Brazilian Portuguese language in informal, short and noisy texts, where the lack of context poses obstacles in text mining.

This area expects to develop computational systems that can monitor and respond to the affective states of an interacting user (IU). These affective states can be observed in terms of emotional responses, which demands continuous monitoring of IU. However, emotional responses can vary according to differences in personality traits. Due to that, we propose a novel model for personality-based agents to produce different emotional responses. This model suggests that distinct personality-based agents could have particular emotional responses. To evaluate our model, we collected data from an on-line social network in which entries have personality expressed by users and emotional information associated. We produced two personality-based agents: one extroverted and another introverted. Experimental results indicate that our model can be promising in providing distinct personality-based agents. The extroverted agent performed better on texts written by extroverted individuals just as the introverted agent performed better on texts written by introverted individuals. Our achieved results point out that personality traits are relevant to produce emotional agents. © 2016 ACM.","Affective computing; Intelligent systems; Text mining","Intelligent systems; Affective Computing; Computational system; Continuous monitoring; Emotional information; Emotional response; On-line social networks; Personality traits; Text mining; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450345125,,,"English","WebMedia - Proc.

One of the technological challenges concerns its storage in a safe, compact, low mass and high gravimetric capacity manner. In this sense, many Hydrogen Storage Materials (HSM) have been investigated to house this source of energy, such as Simple Hydrides, Borohydrides, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Alanates, AB5 Alloys, Ammonia Borane, Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene. Scientific advances aside, less attention has been paid in establishing a panorama of the technological developments in HSM. To assess the technological advances in HSM, patent analysis can be carried out using bibliometrics and text mining approaches in order to forecast the future trend of development and the main players involved in this process. In this work, we evaluated the technological life cycle stage, HSM class prominence and the role of different countries in HSM patenting. The results show that overall HSM patenting decreased after 2007, except in the case of China. On the other hand, the USA, Japan, China and the European Union (EU) were the main patenting territories. Simple Hydrides and Borohydrides were the main classes of HSM that received more attention from the USA and the EU, while Japan had a high share in Solid Solution Alloys. The life cycle stage of HSM seems to be between the first prototype market experiences and full market deployment, even though future assessment is needed to fine-tune the analysis. The developed indicators may also support the funding of new projects and decision making. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bibliometrics; Hydrogen storage; Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Technological forecasting","Carbon; Commerce; Crystalline materials; Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage alloys; Information science; Life cycle; Organometallics; Patents and inventions; Storage (materials); Technological forecasting; Yarn; Bibliometrics; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Solid solution alloy; Technological advances; Technological challenges; Technological development; Hydrogen storage","Chanchetti, L.F.; Postgraduation Program in Materials Science and Engineering (PPGCEM), Materials Engineering Department (DEMa), Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar), Rod.

Consequently, these media are constantly being examined by sentiment analysis systems which aim at classifying the posts as positive or negative. Given the variety of topics discussed and the short length of the posts, the standard approach of using the words as features for machine learning algorithms results in sparse vectors. In this work, we propose using features derived from the ranking generated by an Information Retrieval System in response to a query consisting of the post that needs to be classified. Our system can be fully automatic, has only 24 features, and does not depend on expensive resources.

Most bug findings tools in use today cover bug patterns that are discovered by reading best practices or through developer intuition and anecdotal observation. As such, it is still unclear which bugs happen frequently in practice and which are important for developers to be fixed. We propose a novel semi-Automatic technique, called BugAID, for discovering the most prevalent and detectable bug patterns. BugAID is based on unsupervised machine learning using languageconstruct-based changes distilled from AST differencing of bug fixes in the code. We present a large-scale study of common bug patterns by mining 105K commits from 134 server-side JavaScript projects. We discover 219 bug fixing change types and discuss 13 pervasive bug patterns that occur across multiple projects and can likely be prevented with better tool support.

HTLV-1 ORF-I produces the protein p12 and its cleavage product p8. The functions of these proteins have been linked to immune evasion and viral infectivity and persistence. It is known that the HTLV-1 infection does not necessarily imply the development of pathological processes and here we evaluated whether natural mutations in HTLV-1 ORF-I can influence the proviral load and clinical manifestation of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). For that, we performed molecular characterization, datamining and phylogenetic analysis with HTLV-1 ORF-I sequences from 156 patients with negative or positive diagnosis for HAM/TSP. Our analyses demonstrated that some mutations may be associated with the outcome of HAM/TSP (C39R, L40F, P45L, S69G and R88K) or with proviral load (P34L and F61L). We further examined the presence of mutations in motifs of HBZ and observed that P45L mutation is located within the HBZ nuclear localization signal and was found more frequently between patients with HAM/TSP and high proviral load. These results indicate that some natural mutations are located in functional domains of ORF-I and suggests a potential association between these mutations and the proviral loads and development of HAM/TSP. Therefore it is necessary to conduct functional studies aimed at evaluating the impact of these mutations on the virus persistence and immune evasion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","HAM/TSP; HTLV-1; ORF-1","basic leucine zipper transcription factor; protein p12; protein p8; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus RNA; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; Article; consensus sequence; controlled study; data mining; genetic distance; human; Human T cell leukemia virus infection; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; major clinical study; mutation; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; open reading frame; open reading frame I; phylogeny; priority journal; proviral load; tropical spastic paraparesis; virus load; genetics; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; molecular epidemiology; mutation; open reading frame; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; virology; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Mutation; Open Reading Frames; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; RNA, Viral; Viral Load","Alcantara, L.C.; Centro de Pesquisa Gonçalo Moniz-Fiocruz, Laboratório de Hematologia Genética e Biologia ComputacionalBrazil; email: lalcan@bahia.fiocruz.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",15671348,,IGENC,"27553711","English","Infec.

To deal with continuous and massive streams of data, low computational and memory costs are required from the ML techniques employed; these requirements can be partially fulfilled by using constructive neural networks (CoNN) algorithms. The automatic definition of the Neural Network (NN) architecture, as well as its fast training, promote the high adaptability of such NNs, which allows to skip the conventional model selection phase during the learning process. However, such advantages usually come with the drawback of promoting lower accuracy rates, when compared to other learning approaches. The work described in this paper proposes an ensemble of CoNNs combined with functional expansion techniques to cope with data stream classification. The experiment results, followed by a comparative analysis, showed that CoNN accuracy performance along streaming data does improve with the use of functional expansion. Considering that to functionally expand the input data has a low computational cost, the obtained results turn CoNN algorithms an interesting approach to be considered in data stream classification. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data communication systems; Data handling; Data mining; Learning systems; Neural networks; Classification process; Comparative analysis; Constructive neural network; Conventional modeling; Data stream classifications; Data stream processing; Functional expansion; Neural network (nn); Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006199,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007227126

This way, it is expected to advance in two main questions concerning multilayer perceptrons (MLPs): how to determine the network architecture and how to build models that are more comprehensible. Based on the normalized information gain of each attribute, the algorithm builds the network architecture. In the process, it automatically creates a set of training examples for each individual neuron and executes single-cell learning. Once the network is created and trained, particle swarm optimization is utilized to evolve the connections of the network. Five metrics were utilized to validate the method when compared to decision trees and MLPs: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and comprehensibility. The experiments were executed in thirteen different databases and the results suggest that the proposed algorithm can generate neural networks with good classification performance and more comprehensible. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge extraction from neural networks","Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trees (mathematics); Classification performance; Constructive algorithms; Constructive neural network; Evolutionary approach; Information gain; Knowledge extraction; Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs); Tree-like structures; Evolutionary algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509006199,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007168395

Musical databases have considerably increased in number and size over the past years, therefore, the development of accurate tools for music information retrieval (MIR) has become an important topic in computer science. The increasing theoretical advances in machine learning algorithms together with the abundance of recordings available in digital audio formats, the growing quality and accessibility of on-line symbolic music data, and availability of tools and toolboxes for the extraction of musical properties have motivated many studies on machine learning and MIR. Relevant problems in MIR include classification of songs into genres, which enables the summarization of common features (or patterns) shared by different songs. The automatic classification of music genres plays a fundamental role in the context of music indexing and retrieval, so that websites and device music engines can manage and label music content. Most studies have dealt with such an issue by extracting music characteristics from the audio content, and some have provided overviews of audio features and classification algorithms for music genre classification. However, precise high-level musical information can be extracted from symbolic data (e.g. digital music scores), known to be closely related to the way humans perceive music. A number of approaches use such musical information to process, retrieve and classify music content. This manuscript provides an overview of the most important approaches that deal with music genre classification and consider the symbolic representation of music data. Current issues inherent to such a music format, as well the main algorithms adopted for the modeling of the music feature space are presented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This media is often characterized by its diverse content, which is produced by ordinary users. The potential to easily express ideas and opinions has made social media a source of valuable information on a variety of topics. In particular, information containing comments about consumer products has become prevalent. Here, we are interested in linking products mentioned in unstructured user-generated content, namely open discussion forums, to their respective entities in consumer product catalogs. Among the issues associated with this task, ambiguity is a particularly hard problem, as users typically refer to the same product using many different forms and different products may share the same form. We argue that this problem can be effectively solved using a set of evidences that can be easily extracted from social media content and product descriptions. To achieve this, we show which features should be used, how they can be extracted, and then how to combine them through machine learning techniques. Experiments in three different product categories and two different datasets demonstrate that all the sources of evidence here proposed are important, while contextual information is fundamental to achieve higher levels of precision. In fact, our method, although straightforward, was able to achieve an average improvement of 0.17 in precision and 0.13 in F1, when compared to the current state-of-the-art solution. © 2016 ACM.","Product linking; Social media; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Consumer products; Data mining; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Contextual information; Machine learning techniques; Online social medias; Product descriptions; Product linking; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content; Social networking (online)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450340731,,,"English","Int Conf Inf Knowledge Manage",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996542519

As a way to acquire the human activity data, there are external approaches (e.g. cameras data) and embedded approaches (e.g. accelerometer data). In this area, we can find solutions using multiple sensors simultaneously supporting the real time data acquisition. In the other hand, there are researchers focusing in an optimized and accurate way to classify the activity based on large amount of data. In this paper the Bayes Network and Neural Network classifiers were used. They were built from a public dataset regarding data acquired from accelerometers worn by a set of people. Considering the Data Mining classification steps, the attributes selection, the building and training, the validation tests were done, resulting in the Confusion Matrix, the accuracy rate and the processing time. The goal is to compare different classification methods using different building and training techniques, matching the dataset specifications and quirks, assessing the performance and accuracy rates impacts.

The aim of this study is to assess the vulnerability of a coastal dune system and to identify the areas that result most sensitive to environmental changes. The CDVI has been applied along six transects traced out on two sectors that have been selected based on dune characteristics: Zone A is characterized by well developed parabolic dunes, whereas Zone B is characterized by transverse dunes. The analysis involved 51 quantitative and qualitative variables, divided into five groups: geomorphological dune system condition, marine influence, Aeolian effect, vegetation condition and human effect. The total CDVI was computed as the unweighted average of the partial vulnerability indices. In summary, the total vulnerability can be classified as medium: the geomorphological factor must be monitored at Grande beach, in particular the blowouts in Zone A and the frontal dune retreat in Zone B. The results of the study confirm that the management of coastal areas might be improved using a tool such as the CDVI, which can be easily applied on a regular basis to take under control the factors that mostly affect the evolution of the site.",,"Beaches; Data mining; Earth sciences; Mineral resources; Mining engineering; Mining laws and regulations; Remote sensing; Coastal area; Environmental change; Human effects; Parabolic dune; System conditions; Vegetation condition; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Environmental technology; beach; blowout; classification; coastal morphology; dune; environmental change; sensitivity analysis; transect; vulnerability; Brazil; Santa Catarina",,"Yilmaz I.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

However, an efficient preauthorisation process requires the round-the-clock presence of a preauthorisation reviewer, which increases the operating expenses of the HIP. In this context, the aim of this study was to learn the preauthorisation process using the dental set from an existing database of a non-profit HIP. Methods Pre-processing data techniques as filtering algorithms, random under-sample and imputation were used to mitigate problems that arise from the selection of relevant attributes, class balancing and filling unknown data. The performance of classifiers Random Tree, Naive bayes, Support Vector Machine and Nearest Neighbor was evaluated according to kappa index and the best classifiers were combined by using ensembles. Results The number of attributes were reduced from 164 to 15 and also were created 12 new attributes from existing discrete data associated with the beneficiary's history. The final result was the development of a decision support mechanism that yielded hit rates above 96%. Conclusions It is possible to create a tool based on computational intelligence techniques to evaluate the requests of test/procedure with a high accuracy. This tool can be used to support the activities of the professionals and automatically evaluate less complex cases, like requests not involving risk to the life of patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Classification; Data mining; Ensemble; Machine learning; Prepaid health plans","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Decision support systems; Health insurance; Learning systems; Computational intelligence techniques; Control mechanism; Ensemble; Filtering algorithm; Health care professionals; Insurance providers; Performance of classifier; Prepaid health plans; Classification (of information); algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; classifier; decision support system; health care personnel; human; medical decision making; non profit organization; preauthorisation; priority journal; support vector machine; algorithm; artificial intelligence; Bayes theorem; clinical decision making; machine learning; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Clinical Decision-Making; Health Personnel; Humans; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine","Araújo, F.H.D.; Campus Senador Helvídio Nunes de Barros, Federal University of PiauíBrazil; email: flavio86@ufpi.edu.br",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",13865056,,IJMIF,"27573306","English","Int.

This phenomenon was also observed during freezing exposure, severe dehydration, aerial exposure of water-breathing animals and estivation. However, as far as we know, there is no analysis available of the prevalence of POS among animal species. A major problem is the very definition of POS, since many animal species show both increases and decreases of antioxidants during low oxygen stress and estivation. Therefore, we established three different criteria; from inclusive to restrictive and analyzed how widespread the POS phenomenon is in the animal kingdom. We analyzed all available papers in several databases about the modulation of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation or estivation. Based on the magnitude of change (as % change) during the specific low oxygen stresses or estivation, we classified each species as POS-positive, POS-negative or POS-neutral, considering the three different criteria. The prevalence of POS-positive animals (102 species from 8 phyla) was stress-dependent: in estivation and dehydration it was 91–100%, while in hypoxia it was 37.5–53%, depending on the criteria. In the case of air exposure, anoxia and freezing the proportions of POS-positive species were 54–77%, 64–77% and 75–86%, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of POS was 58 to 68% when all stresses and all species were analyzed together. The results indicate the key importance of POS as a survival strategy of animals exposed to freezing, dehydration and estivation, and, to a lesser extent, to oxygen deprivation itself (i.e. hypoxia and anoxia). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Air exposure; Anoxia; Antioxidant; Dehydration; Estivation; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species","antioxidant; catalase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; manganese superoxide dismutase; metallothionein; oxygen; peroxiredoxin; selenium; selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antioxidant; enzyme; glutathione; aestivation; Amphibia; animal experiment; animal model; annelid; anoxia; arthropod; Article; bivalve; cephalopod; Chordata; Cnidaria; controlled study; dehydration; echinoderm; environmental exposure; freezing; hypoxia; insect; molecular biology; mollusc; nematode; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prevalence; reptile; species composition; survival rate; Tardigrada; adaptation; animal; biodiversity; data mining; enzymology; hypoxia; metabolism; pathophysiology; veterinary medicine; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antioxidants; Biodiversity; Data Mining; Enzymes; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative Stress","Hermes-Lima, M.; Departamento de Biologia Celular, Instituto de Ciências Biológicas, Universidade de Brasília, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, Asa Norte, Brazil; email: hermes@unb.br",,"Elsevier Inc.",10956433,,CBPAB,"26851497","English","Comp.

Considering the characteristics of the mechanisms and data related to yield, data mining techniques are suitable candidates for modelling. The use of these techniques within a context with feature engineering, feature selection, and proper tuning can further improve performance beyond a simple replacement of multiple linear regression. To evaluate the impact of the different steps in the mentioned context, we evaluated sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield modelling with data obtained from a sugarcane mill. For a combination of six techniques, tuning, feature selection, and feature engineering, leading to 66 combinations, we assessed final model performance. Average performance across combinations resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.42 Mg ha−1. Using different techniques led to a range of MAE from 4.57 to 8.80 Mg ha−1 on average. The best and worst performances for an individual model were MAEs of 4.11 and 9.00 Mg ha−1. Models with lower performance were close to simply predicting yield from the average yield for each number of cuts (MAE of 9.86 Mg ha−1). Tuning and feature engineering reduced the MAE on average by 1.17 and 0.64 Mg ha−1, respectively. Feature selection removed nearly 40% of the features but increased the MAE by 0.19 Mg ha−1. The performance of models was improved by simple strategies such as decomposing weather attributes and detailing fertilisation. Evaluation of feature importance provided by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm was used to explain the performance gains. If empirical models are needed, they will rely on using advanced techniques, but they will need proper algorithm tuning and feature engineering to extract most of the information from datasets. Based on the results, we recommend following the presented workflow for the development of yield models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural networks; Boosted regression trees; Machine learning; Random forest; Regression trees; Support vector machines","Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning systems; Linear regression; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Boosted regression trees; Feature engineerings; Feature selection algorithm; Individual modeling; Industrial supply chains; Multiple linear regressions; Random forests; Regression trees; Feature extraction; agricultural modeling; agricultural technology; agroindustry; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; data mining; decision making; machine learning; multiple regression; performance assessment; rainfed agriculture; sugar cane; vector autoregression; Saccharum","Rodrigues, L.H.A.; School of Agricultural Engineering, University of CampinasBrazil; email: lique@feagri.unicamp.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681699,,CEAGE,,"English","Comput.

The objective is to develop an approach that can use voltage/current measurements provided by active and reactive monitors to IVVC control without the need to perform retraining or repeat optimization simulations. The performance of the SVM scheme for different input selection (i.e., active and reactive power and node voltage) is discussed. Moreover, the generality of the proposed SVM scheme is investigated under noisy environment as well as under network reconfiguration.

This is a critical step because data quality is directly reflected in the results of the planning and operation of electrical system. This paper proposes two models for the identification and treatment of outliers in electrical load data. The first model was built using the ensemble technique through a combination of individual models. The second model was created from an expert system that uses a rules database to detect outliers. The processing of the outliers detected is conducted through a combination of non-outliers load in the same time interval. To evaluate the performance, the models were applied in a historical load database measured in the Northeast of Brazil during year of 2006.

This approach also allows monitoring the extent to which field and topic-specific activities further accelerate, stabilise or abate, and the time it takes for such dynamics to unfold. By applying the ‘DETECTS’ methodology on data from scientific publications and patents, this work sheds light on: the structure, articulation and relevance of the most important scientific and technological developments occurred during the period 1990–2011; the extent to which new fields arise from the cross-fertilisation of different technologies; the way in which advancements in science relate to technological progress; and the areas where future developments are likely to occur in the short and medium term.

We found that, with surprisingly high probabilities (90% for Java and 71% for Android), several types of cryptography misuse can be found in the posts, but unfortunately masked by technology-specific issues and programming concerns. We also found that cryptographic bad practices frequently occur in pairs or triples. We related triple associations to use cases and tasks, characterizing worst case scenarios of cryptography misuse. Finally, we observed that hard-to-use architectures confuse developers and contribute to perpetuate recurring errors in cryptographic programming. © 2016 IEEE.","Apriori algorithm; cryptography misuse; data mining; Java cryptographic architecture; secure coding","Android (operating system); C (programming language); Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Java programming language; Mobile security; Network security; Social networking (online); Software reliability; Android securities; Apriori algorithms; Cryptographic architecture; High probability; Programming tasks; Secure coding; Software developer; Worst case scenario; Cryptography",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509037131,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

To derive these clusters, the data input required is often a single n × n dissimilarity matrix. Yet for many applications, more than one instance of the dissimilarity matrix is available and so to conform to model requirements, it is common practice to aggregate (e.g., sum up, average) the matrices. This aggregation practice results in clustering solutions that mask the true nature of the original data. In this paper we introduce a clustering model which, to handle the heterogeneity, uses all available dissimilarity matrices and identifies for groups of individuals clustering objects in a similar way. The model is a nonconvex problem and difficult to solve exactly, and we thus introduce a Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic to provide solutions efficiently. Computational experiments and an empirical application to perception of chocolate candy show that the heuristic algorithm is efficient and that the proposed model is suited for recovering heterogeneous data. Implications for clustering researchers are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most recommender approaches focus only on the users and items to make the recommendations. However, in many applications, it is also important to incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process. Although the use of contextual information has received great focus in recent years, there is a lack of automatic methods to obtain such information for context-aware recommender systems. Some works address this problem by proposing supervised methods, which require greater human effort and whose results are not so satisfactory. In this scenario, we propose an unsupervised method to extract contextual information from web page content. Our method builds topic hierarchies from page textual content considering, besides the traditional bag-of-words, valuable information of texts as named entities and domain terms (privileged information). The topics extracted from the hierarchies are used as contextual information in context-aware recommender systems. We conducted experiments by using two data sets and two baselines: the first baseline is a recommendation system that does not use contextual information and the second baseline is a method proposed in literature to extract contextual information. The results are, in general, very good and present significant gains. In conclusion, our method has advantages and innovations:(i) it is unsupervised; (ii) it considers the context of the item (Web page), instead of the context of the user as in most of the few existing methods, which is an innovation; (iii) it uses privileged information in addition to the existing technical information from pages; and (iv) it presented good and promising empirical results. This work represents an advance in the state-of-the-art in context extraction, which means an important contribution to context-aware recommender systems, a kind of specialized and intelligent system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The protein's function prediction is considered a hierarchical classification problem because their functions are arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of classes. This paper presents an algorithm for hierarchical classification using the jumping emerging patterns approach. Jumping emerging patterns have been used to flat classification and in this work we explore its adoption in a hierarchical classification scenario. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in eight real datasets, compared against two other recent hierarchical classification algorithms from the literature and also with flat k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm.

Nowadays organizations and industries are facing the challenge of organizing, analyzing and extracting knowledge from masses of unstructured information for decision making process. The development of automatic methods to produce usable structured information from unstructured text sources is extremely valuable to them. Opposed to the traditional text classification methods that need a set of well-classified trained corpus to perform efficient classification; the ontology-based classifier benefits from the domain knowledge and provides more accuracy. In a previous work we proposed and evaluated an ontology-based heuristic algorithm [28] for occupational health control process, particularly, for the case of automatic detection of accidents from unstructured texts. Our extended proposal is more domain dependent because it uses technical terms and contrast the relevance of these technical terms into the text, so the heuristic is more accurate.

However, since most of these problems may depend on environments that change over time, performing classification tasks in dynamic environments has been a challenge in data mining research domain in the last decades. Currently, in the literature, the most common strategies used to detect changes are based on accuracy monitoring, which relies on previous knowledge of the data in order to identify whether or not correct classifications are provided. However, such a feedback can be infeasible in practical problems. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of current machine learning/data mining approaches proposed to deal with dynamic environments problems. The objective is to highlight the main drawbacks and open issues, as well as future directions and problems worthy of investigation.

The aim of this study was to use the J48 algorithm as a classification task for data from women exhibiting changes in bone densitometry. The study population included all patients treated at the diagnostic center for bone densitometry since 2010. Census sample data collection was conducted as all elements of the population were included in the sample. The service in question provides care to patients via the Brazilian Unified Health System and private plans. The results of the classification task were analyzed using the J48 algorithm, and among the dichotomized variables associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, the mean accuracy was 74.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.0-68.0) and the mean area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.64-0.66), with a mean sensitivity of 76.0 (95% CI, 76.0-76.0) and a mean specificity of 48.0 (95% CI, 46.0-49.0). The analyzed results showed higher values of sensitivity, accuracy, and curve of the ROC area in experiments conducted with individuals with osteoporosis. Most of the generated rules were consistent with the literature, and the few differences might serve as hypotheses for further studies. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA, Monsys was created to enable data mining in the virtual learning environment known as Moodle. Methods: This is an exploratory study using documentary and bibliographic research and analysis of the Monsys database. Two classes (2010 and 2011) were selected as research subjects, one with Monsys intervention and the other without. The samples were matched (using a ration of 1:1) by gender, age, marital status, graduation year, previous graduation status, location and profession. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression model with a 5 % significance level. Results: The findings show that the dropout rate in the class in which Monsys was not employed (2010) was 43.2 %. However, the dropout rate in the class of 2011, in which the tool was employed as a pedagogical team aid, was 30.6 %. After statistical adjustment, the Monsys monitoring system remained in correlation with the course completion variable (adjusted OR = 1.74, IC95% = 1.17-2.59; p = 0.005), suggesting that the use of the Monsys tool, isolated to the adjusted variables, can enhance the likelihood that students will complete the course. Using the chi-square test, a profile analysis of students revealed a higher completion rate among women (67.7 %) than men (52.2 %). Analysis of age demonstrated that students between 40 and 49 years dropped out the least (32.1 %) and, with regard to professional training, nurses have the lowest dropout rates (36.3 %). Conclusions: The use of Monsys significantly reduced the dropout, with results showing greater association between the variables denoting presence of the monitoring system and female gender. © 2016 The Author(s).","Distance learning; Dropout; Pedagogical support; Specialization","chi square test; data base; data mining; exploratory research; family health; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning environment; logistic regression analysis; male; marriage; model; monitoring; nurse; research subject; specialization; student; adult; education; family health; medical school; medical student; procedures; psychology; risk factor; school dropout; standards; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Education, Distance; Educational Measurement; Family Health; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Schools, Medical; Student Dropouts; Students, Medical","De Castro E Lima Baesse, D.; Universidade Aberta Do Sistema Único de Saúde - UNA-SUS, Universidade Federal Do Maranhão - UFMA, Rua Viana Vaz, 41, Centro, Brazil; email: baesse2008@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central",14726920,,,"27549158","English","BMC Med.

Reports found in the literature reveal two apparent conflicting visions of how RSEs should be modeled. From one side, the Poissonian processes, of which consecutive events follow each other at a relatively regular time and should not be correlated. On the other side, the self-exciting processes, which are able to generate bursts of correlated events. The existence of many and sometimes conflicting approaches to model RSEs is a consequence of the unpredictability of the aggregated dynamics of our individual and routine activities, which sometimes show simple patterns, but sometimes results in irregular rising and falling trends. In this paper we propose a parsimonious way to characterize general RSEs, namely the Burstiness Scale (BuSca) model. BuSca views each RSE as a mix of two independent process: a Poissonian and a self-exciting one. Here we describe a fast method to extract the two parameters of BuSca that, together, gives the burstiness scale, which represents how much of the RSE is due to bursty and viral effects. We validated our method in eight diverse and large datasets containing real random series of events seen in Twitter, Yelp, e-mail conversations, Digg, and online forums. Results showed that, even using only two parameters, BuSca is able to accurately describe RSEs seen in these diverse systems, what can leverage many applications. © 2016 ACM.","Communication dynamics; Self-exciting point process; Social media","Data mining; Aggregated dynamics; Large datasets; Online forums; Parsimonious modeling; Point process; Poissonian process; Social media; Two parameter; Social networking (online)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450342322,,,"English","Proc.

Two major features distinguish data stream from batch learning: stream data are generated on the fly, possibly in a fast and variable rate; and the underlying data distribution can be non-stationary, leading to a phenomenon known as concept drift. Therefore, most of the research on data stream classification focuses on proposing effcient models that can adapt to concept drifts and maintain a stable performance over time. However, specifically for the classification task, the majority of such methods rely on the instantaneous availability of true labels for all already classified instances. This is a strong assumption that is rarely fulfilled in practical applications. Hence there is a clear need for effcient methods that can detect concept drifts in an unsupervised way. One possibility is the well-known Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a statistical hypothesis test that checks whether two samples differ. This work has two main contributions. The first one is the Incremental Kolmogorov-Smirnov algorithm that allows performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test instantly using two samples that change over time, where the change is an insertion and/or removal of an observation. Our algorithm employs a randomized tree and is able to perform the insertion and removal operations in O(logN) with high probability and calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in O(1), where N is the number of sample observations. This is a significant speed-up compared to the O(N logN) cost of the non-incremental implementation. The second contribution is the use of the Incremental Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect concept drifts without true labels. Classification algorithms adapted to use the test rely on a limited portion of those labels just to update the classification model after a concept drift is detected. © 2016 ACM.","Cartesian tree; Concept drift; Data stream; Kolmogorov-Smirnov; Lazy propagation; Treap","Forestry; Trees (mathematics); Cartesian Trees; Concept drifts; Data stream; Kolmogorov-Smirnov; Treap; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450342322,,,"English","Proc.

However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process and is particularly useful in applications such as tweet sentiment analysis, where a large amount of unlabeled data is available. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although quite appealing, is relatively new. We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that combines unsupervised information, captured from a similarity matrix constructed from unlabeled data, with a classifier. Our motivation is that such a similarity matrix is a powerful knowledge-discovery tool that can help classify unlabeled tweet sets. Our framework makes use of the well-known Self-training algorithm to induce a better tweet sentiment classifier. Experimental results in real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve the accuracy of tweet sentiment analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Semi-supervised learning; Tweet sentiment analysis","Algorithms; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Matrix algebra; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Classification models; Labeled and unlabeled data; Real-world datasets; Semi- supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Similarity matrix; Supervised algorithm; Classification (of information)","Da Silva, N.F.F.; Department of Computer Sciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Av.

The strategy combines the wines’ functionality, designed as antioxidant activity (DPPH and ORAC), total polyphenols (TP), total anthocyanins (TA), and color, with a data mining technique known as support vector machines (SVM). The original dataset has 16 wine samples from Brazil and 113 from Chile. Algorithms were used to balance the dataset. Using resampling algorithms, we extended the Brazilian wines to 32 samples and reduced the Chilean wines to 32. With the proposed methodology, it was possible to classify the origin of the wine with an accuracy of 89% when using the 20 original elements. An accuracy of 83% was found using only 5 elements (L, DPPH, delph-3-acetylglu, peon-3-(coum)glu, and pet-3-acetylglu).

Methods based on DTW have achieved significant results in time-series data mining. The original DTW method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classification. It disregards the temporal range when finding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a specific phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classifier needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original DTW method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classification using DTW. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Dynamic programming; image sequence analysis; monitoring; pattern classification; time series","Data mining; Dynamic programming; Image processing; Land use; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Time series; Time series analysis; Image sequence analysis; Land cover classification; Land use and land cover mapping; Land-use and land cover classifications; Remote sensing images; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Time series classifications; Time series data mining; Mapping; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data mining; image classification; land cover; land use; mapping; pattern recognition; spatiotemporal analysis; time series",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers",19391404,,,,"English","IEEE J.

A screening and risk assessment system for smear-negative PTB using artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on patient signs and symptoms is proposed. Methods: The prognostic and risk assessment models exploit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and inspired adaptive resonance theory (iART) network. Model development considered data from 136 patients with suspected smear-negative PTB in a general hospital. Results: MLP showed higher sensitivity (100%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 78-100%) than the other techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) linear (86%; 95% CI 60-96%), multivariate logistic regression (MLR) (79%; 95% CI 53-93%), and classification and regression tree (CART) (71%; 95% CI 45-88%). MLR showed a slightly higher specificity (85%; 95% CI 59-96%) than MLP (80%; 95% CI 54-93%), SVM linear (75%, 95% CI 49-90%), and CART (65%; 95% CI 39-84%). In terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the MLP model exhibited a higher value (0.918, 95% CI 0.824-1.000) than the SVM linear (0.796, 95% CI 0.651-0.970) and MLR (0.782, 95% CI 0.663-0.960) models. The significant signs and symptoms identified in risk groups are coherent with clinical practice. Conclusions: In settings with a high prevalence of smear-negative PTB, the system can be useful for screening and also to aid clinical practice in expediting complementary tests for higher risk patients. © 2016 The Authors.","Computational intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems","adult; Article; artificial neural network; clinical practice; diagnostic accuracy; human; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; middle aged; perceptron; prevalence; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sputum smear; support vector machine; artificial neural network; devices; evaluation study; female; isolation and purification; male; mass screening; microbiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; physiology; procedures; statistical model; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Adult; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Neural Networks (Computer); ROC Curve; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary","de O.

Recently, companies and research groups have announced that they have been employing health software frameworks. This paper presents the design, proof-of-concept implementations and experimentation of the Health Surveillance Software Framework (HSSF). The HSSF is a framework that tackles the demand for the recommendation of surveillance information aiming at supporting preventive healthcare strategies. Examples of such strategies are the automatic recommendation of surveillance levels to patients in need of healthcare and the automatic recommendation of scientific literature that elucidates epigenetic problems related to patients. HSSF was created from two systems we developed in our previous work on health surveillance systems: the Automatic-SL and CISS systems. The Automatic-SL system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making decisions and in identifying children with developmental problems. The CISS service associates genetic and epigenetic risk factors related to chronic diseases with patient's clinical records. Towards evaluating the HSSF framework, two new systems, CISS+ and CISS-SW, were created by means of abstractions and instantiations of the framework (design and code). We show that HSSF supported the development of the two new systems given that they both recommend scientific papers using medical records as queries even though they exploit different computational technologies. In an experiment using simulated patients’ medical records, we show that CISS, CISS+, and CISS-SW systems recommended more closely related and somewhat related documents than Google, Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering recall and precision measures, CISS+ surpasses CISS-SW in terms of precision. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Biomedical informatics; Information extraction; Ontology; Recommender systems: medical records and scientific papers; Retrieval and application of biomedical knowledge and information; Reuse; Software framework","Application programs; Bioinformatics; Computer programming; Computer software reusability; Data mining; Health; Health care; Information retrieval; Monitoring; Ontology; Search engines; Biomedical informatics; Medical record; Retrieval and application of biomedical knowledge and information; Reuse; Software frameworks; Medical information systems; accuracy; Article; computer program; electronic medical record system; genetic risk; health care quality; health survey; information dissemination; medical information system; medical record; preventive medicine; priority journal; process development; recall; risk factor; system analysis; child; chronic disease; computer system; diagnosis; health status; human; software; Child; Chronic Disease; Computer Systems; Diagnosis; Health Status; Humans; Medical Records; Population Surveillance; Software","Macedo, A.A.; Biomedical Informatics Group, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of São Paulo (USP), Av.

However, H.264/AVC has dominated the market for over a decade, so that there is an enormous amount of legacy content that must be migrated. This paper proposes a fast transcoder based on an extensive data mining process on H.264/AVC decoding attributes. The data mining allowed identifying relevant information from the H.264/AVC decoding process, which was conveyed to the C4.5 machine learning algorithm to build a set of decision trees that simplify the complex Coding Unit (CU) size decision in HEVC. Experimental results have shown an average reduction of 44% in the transcoding time, with a small bit rate increase of 1.67%.

Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research.

This is because coffee fields are extremely heterogeneous in terms of spectral reflectance. This study therefore aims to contribute to the mapping of coffee crops using multispectral imagery with 23.5 m spatial resolution taken by the Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS III) instrument on board the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite system. The section of land covered by this study is a traditional coffee-producing province located in the south of the State of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Whereas the pixel mixture effect was managed using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), the classification was carried out using data mining (DM) techniques. The decision tree (DT) outcomes were evaluated using a simple and qualitative method based on the elements of photointerpretation. In total, eight land-use and land-cover (LULC) types were mapped, including three classes of coffee-growing land expressing different phenological conditions and management. These were named ‘Production Coffee’, ‘Mixed Coffee’, and ‘Old/Pruned Coffee’. The results showed that the methodology was effective for mapping LULC types, as the workflow adopted simplified image interpretation and offered improvements in the classification performance. Despite the coffee-cultivation classes having a large spectral variability, which increases the chances of classification errors, not many confusions were observed involving the three coffee classes mapped with other categories of use. This therefore shows that the method was efficient in isolating the coffee classes (with an accuracy greater than 70%) from other categories of use. Comparing the results obtained in this work with a conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) classification, the results revealed that when using the methodology described, the confusions between classes were less dispersed and an improvement of approximately 10% was observed in the mapping of the Production Coffee class. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Land use; Maximum likelihood; Mixtures; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Classification errors; Classification performance; Land use and land cover; Maximum-likelihood classification; Multi-spectral imagery; Spectral mixture analysis; Spectral reflectances; Spectral variability; Data mining; coffee; data mining; IRS (satellite); LISS; mapping; multispectral image; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; Brazil; Minas Gerais","Kawakubo, F.S.; Laboratory of Remote Sensing, Department of Geography, University of São Paulo, Avenida Professor Lineu Prestes, 338, Brazil; email: fsk@usp.br",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

In these situations, massive data are constantly generated at high speed and the underlying target function can change over time. The iadem family of algorithms is based on Hoeffding's and Chernoff's bounds and induces online decision trees from data streams, but is not able to handle concept drift. This study extends this family to deal with time-changing data streams. The new online algorithm, named iadem-3, performs two main actions in response to a concept drift. Firstly, it resets the variables affected by the change and maintains unbroken the structure of the tree, which allows for changes in which consecutive target functions are very similar. Secondly, it creates alternative models that replace parts of the main tree when they significantly improve the accuracy of the model, thereby rebuilding the main tree if needed. An online change detector and a non-parametric statistical test based on Hoeffding's bounds are used to guarantee this significance. A new pruning method is also incorporated in iadem-3, making sure that all split tests previously installed in decision nodes are useful. The learning model is also viewed as an ensemble of classifiers, and predictions of the main and alternative models are combined to classify unlabeled examples. iadem-3 is empirically compared with various well-known decision tree induction algorithms for concept drift detection. We empirically show that our new algorithm often reaches higher levels of accuracy with smaller decision tree models, maintaining the processing time bounded, irrespective of the number of instances processed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Common applications range from product recommendation to social networks and protein interaction. One of the main inferences in this types of networks is the guilty-by-Association method, where labeled nodes propagate their information throughout the network, towards unlabeled nodes. While there is a widely used algorithm for this context, called Belief Propagation, it lacks the necessary convergence guarantees for loopy-networks. More recently, a new alternative method was proposed, called LinBP and while it solved the convergence issue, the scalability for large graphs that do not fit memory remains a challenge. Additionally, most works that try to use BP considering large scale graphs rely on specific infrastructure such as supercomputers and computational clusters. Therefore we propose a new algorithm, that leverages state-of-The-Art asynchronous vertex-centric parallel processing techniques in conjunction with the state-of-The-Art BP alternative LinBP, to provide a scalable framework for large graph inference that runs on a single commodity machine. Our results show that our algorithm is up to 200 times faster than LinBP's SQL implementation on tested networks, while achieving the same accuracy rate. We also show that due to the asynchronous processing, our algorithm actually needs less iterations to converge when compared to LinBP when using the same parameters. Finally, we believe that our methodology highlights the yet not fully explored parallelism available on commodity machines, leaning towards a more cost-efficient computational paradigm. © 2016 IEEE.","Belief propagation; Data analysis; Graphs; Parallel processing","Cluster computing; Data flow analysis; Data mining; Data reduction; Graphic methods; Inference engines; Supercomputers; Asynchronous processing; Belief propagation; Belief propagation algorithm; Computational cluster; Computational paradigm; Graphs; Parallel processing; Product recommendation; Graph theory",,"Domeniconi C.Gullo F.Bonchi F.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Baeza-Yates R.Baeza-Yates R.Zhou Z.-H.Wu X.","IEEE Computer Society",23759232,9781509054725,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Although there exist algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of Big Data, unfortunately, they all fail to identify/eliminate non-linear correlations between attributes. This paper tackles the problem by exploring concepts of the Fractal Theory and massive parallel processing to present Curl-Remover, a novel dimensionality reduction technique for very large datasets. Our contributions are: Curl-Remover eliminates linear and non-linear attribute correlations as well as irrelevant ones, it is unsupervised and suits for analytical tasks in general-not only classification, it presents linear scale-up, it does not require the user to guess the number of attributes to be removed, and, it preserves the attributes' semantics. We performed experiments on synthetic and real data spanning up to 1.1 billion points and Curl-Remover outperformed a PCA-based algorithm, being up to 8% more accurate. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Data; Feature selection; Fractal Theory; Massive parallel processing; Non-linear attribute correlations","Big data; Data mining; Feature extraction; Fractals; Semantics; Curse of dimensionality; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Fractal theory; Non linear; Non-linear correlations; Parallel processing; Synthetic and real data; Large dataset",,"Domeniconi C.Gullo F.Bonchi F.Bonchi F.Domingo-Ferrer J.Baeza-Yates R.Baeza-Yates R.Baeza-Yates R.Zhou Z.-H.Wu X.","IEEE Computer Society",23759232,9781509054725,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Diagnosis and treatment in early stages increase cure chances. The temperature of cancerous tissue is generally higher than that of healthy surrounding tissues, making thermography an option to be considered in screening strategies of this cancer type. This paper proposes a hybrid methodology for analyzing dynamic infrared thermography in order to indicate patients with risk of breast cancer, using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, which characterizes the methodology as hybrid. The dynamic infrared thermography monitors or quantitatively measures temperature changes on the examined surface, after a thermal stress. In the dynamic infrared thermography execution, a sequence of breast thermograms is generated. In the proposed methodology, this sequence is processed and analyzed by several techniques. First, the region of the breasts is segmented and the thermograms of the sequence are registered. Then, temperature time series are built and the k-means algorithm is applied on these series using various values of k. Clustering formed by k-means algorithm, for each k value, is evaluated using clustering validation indices, generating values treated as features in the classification model construction step. A data mining tool was used to solve the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem in classification tasks. Besides the classification algorithm recommended by the data mining tool, classifiers based on Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision rules and decision tree were executed on the data set used for evaluation. Test results support that the proposed analysis methodology is able to indicate patients with breast cancer. Among 39 tested classification algorithms, K-Star and Bayes Net presented 100% classification accuracy. Furthermore, among the Bayes Net, multi-layer perceptron, decision table and random forest classification algorithms, an average accuracy of 95.38% was obtained. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Breast cancer; Classification; Dynamic infrared thermography; Machine learning; Temperature time series","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Decision tables; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; Optimization; Supervised learning; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Time series; Time series analysis; Tissue; Breast Cancer; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Multi layer perceptron; Random forest classification; Supervised machine learning; Data mining; Article; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; body temperature measurement; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer risk; classification algorithm; classifier; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; human; infrared photography; methodology; model; monitor; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; supervised machine learning; time series analysis; biological model; Breast Neoplasms; cluster analysis; female; task performance; thermography; Breast Neoplasms; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Models, Biological; Thermography; Time and Motion Studies","Silva, L.F.Av.

The Piegas system determines automatically the sentiments, or polarity, of tweets written in Portuguese about a topic of interest. Two main requirements directed the design and development of the system: (i) good usability and (ii) good precision in determining the sentiments expressed about the topic of interest. With the first requirement in mind, the system, developed using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, has a clean interface to enter the keywords that describe the topic of interest and to present the results in several levels of detail. To meet the second requirement, the system uses a Naïve Bayes classifier to identify the sentiments of tweets, as the literature shows that this algorithm combines a good classificatory performance and low response time. The usability of the system was assessed using well-known ergonomic criteria, with satisfactory results. The systems also presented good results in experiments conducted to measure its precision in identifying the predominant polarity of tweets related to five different topics of interest. © 2016 IEEE.","Naive Bayes classifier; opinion mining; Portuguese language; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","Classifiers; Naive Bayes classifiers; Opinion mining; Portuguese languages; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Data mining",,,"IEEE Computer Society",15480992,,,,"Portuguese","IEEE.

A critical consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions. Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using 28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories. Multitemporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the following years, selective logging did not always precede complete deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with low-intensity forest damage. © 2016, American Meteorological Society.

This paper presents a methodology developed to elucidate the dynamics of urban growth and its relationship with socioeconomic patterns in the Bogotá-Sabana region of Colombia. To analyze the evolution of growth in two time frames, various techniques are applied, including correlation, clustering, regionalization, and others.

Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results. © 2016, The Author(s).","Datasets; Evaluation; Measures; Unsupervised outlier detection","Benchmarking; Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Statistics; Benchmark datasets; Datasets; Evaluation; Evaluation measures; K-nearest neighborhoods; Measures; Outlier Detection; Outlier detection algorithm; Data mining","Zimek, A.; Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Oettingenstr. 67, Germany; email: zimek@dbs.ifi.lmu.de",,"Springer New York LLC",13845810,,,,"English","Data Min.

We present a new algorithm, called TEDA-Cloud, based on the recently introduced TEDA approach to outlier detection. TEDA-Cloud is a statistical method based on the concepts of typicality and eccentricity able to group similar data observations. Instead of the traditional concept of clusters, the data is grouped in the form of granular unities called data clouds, which are structures with no pre-defined shape or set boundaries. TEDA-Cloud is a fully autonomous and self-evolving algorithm that can be used for data clustering of online data streams and applications that require real-time response. Since it is fully autonomous, TEDA-Cloud is able to ""start from scratch"" (from an empty knowledge basis), create, update and merge data clouds, in a fully autonomous manner, without requiring any user-defined parameters (e.g. number of clusters, size, radius) or previous training. Moreover, TEDA-Cloud, unlike most of the traditional statistical approaches, does not rely on a specific data distribution or on the assumption of independence of data samples. The results, obtained from multiple data sets that are very well known in literature, are very encouraging. ©2016 IEEE.","Autonomous learning; Clustering; Data streams; Eccentricity; Evolving systems; Real-time; TEDA; Typicality","Algorithms; Cluster analysis; Data communication systems; Data mining; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Autonomous learning; Clustering; Data stream; Eccentricity; Evolving systems; Real time; TEDA; Typicality; Clustering algorithms",,"Costa B.S.J.Lughofer E.Skrjanc I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509025831,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

The focus of this work was the proposal and development of a computational system able to identify patterns in a database containing sale records from a retail organization and, based on them, infer association rules that also deal with the temporal aspect of the data. Experiments with the system on real data from a retail company, after a two-step pre-processing of the raw data, are presented.

Most frameworks, however, do not allow users to specify how communication must take place: That element is deeply embedded into the run-time system abstractions, making changes hard to implement. In this work, we describe Wathershed-ng, our re-engineering of the Watershed system, a framework based on the filter-stream paradigm and originally focused on continuous stream processing. Like other big-data environments, Watershed provided object-oriented abstractions to express computation (filters), but the implementation of streams was a run-time system element. By isolating stream functionality into appropriate classes, combination of communication patterns and reuse of common message handling functions (like compression and blocking) become possible. The new architecture even allows the design of new communication patterns, for example, allowing users to choose MPI, TCP, or shared memory implementations of communication channels as their problem demands. Applications designed for the new interface showed reductions in code size on the order of 50% and above in some cases. The performance results also showed significant improvements, because some implementation bottlenecks were removed in the re-engineering process. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","big data; distributed systems; frameworks; watershed","Abstracting; Data handling; Data mining; Distributed parameter control systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Reengineering; Watersheds; Common messages; Communication pattern; Distributed stream processing; Distributed systems; frameworks; Performance data; Run time systems; Stream processing; Big data","Rocha, R.; Department of Computer Science, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: rcor@dcc.ufmg.br",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15320626,,CCPEB,,"English","Concurr.

It has provided an enormous dataset of the so-called sentiments, whose classification can take place through supervised learning. To build supervised learning models, classification algorithms require a set of representative labeled data. However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses unlabeled data to complement the information provided by the labeled data in the training process; therefore, it is particularly useful in applications including tweet sentiment analysis, where a huge quantity of unlabeled data is accessible. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although appealing, is relatively new. We provide a comprehensive survey of semi-supervised approaches applied to tweet classification. Such approaches consist of graph-based, wrapper-based, and topic-based methods. A comparative study of algorithms based on self-training, co-training, topic modeling, and distant supervision highlights their biases and sheds light on aspects that the practitioner should consider in real-world applications. © 2016 ACM.","Co-training; Self-training; Semi-supervised learning; Topic modeling; Tweet sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Data mining; Graphic methods; Surveys; Co-training; Self training; Semi- supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Supervised learning",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",03600300,,ACSUE,,"English","ACM Comput Surv",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978162126

This highlights the need for computational methods to determine protein functions quickly and reliably. We believe dividing a protein family into subtypes which share specific functions uncommon to the whole family reduces the function annotation problem’s complexity. Hence, this work’s purpose is to detect isofunctional subfamilies inside a family of unknown function, while identifying differentiating residues. Similarity between protein pairs according to various properties is interpreted as functional similarity evidence. Data are integrated using genetic programming and provided to a spectral clustering algorithm, which creates clusters of similar proteins. The proposed framework was applied to well-known protein families and to a family of unknown function, then compared to ASMC. Results showed our fully automated technique obtained better clusters than ASMC for two families, besides equivalent results for other two, including one whose clusters were manually defined. Clusters produced by our framework showed great correspondence with the known subfamilies, besides being more contrasting than those produced by ASMC. Additionally, for the families whose specificity determining positions are known, such residues were among those our technique considered most important to differentiate a given group. When run with the crotonase and enolase SFLD superfamilies, the results showed great agreement with this gold-standard. Best results consistently involved multiple data types, thus confirming our hypothesis that similarities according to different knowledge domains may be used as functional similarity evidence. Our main contributions are the proposed strategy for selecting and integrating data types, along with the ability to work with noisy and incomplete data; domain knowledge usage for detecting subfamilies in a family with different specificities, thus reducing the complexity of the experimental function characterization problem; and the identification of residues responsible for specificity. © 2016 Boari de Lima et al.",,"enolase; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase; protein; active sites modeling and clustering; algorithm; amino acid sequence; Article; automation; data mining; data processing; protein analysis; protein family; protein function; protein structure; spectral clustering; statistical analysis; biology; classification; cluster analysis; physiology; procedures; protein database; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein","Boari de Lima, E.; Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: eblima@dcc.ufmg.br",,"Public Library of Science",1553734X,,,"27348631","English","PLoS Comput.

Our approach is to automatically create a Domain Dictionary that contains terms with sentiment in the IT context, used to filter terms in ticket for sentiment analysis. We experiment and evaluate three approaches for calculating the polarity of terms in tickets. Our study was developed using 34,895 tickets from five organizations, from which we randomly selected 2,333 tickets to compose a Gold Standard.

Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries. © The Author(s) 2015.

The main aim of this study was to obtain a digital soil map using artificial neural networks (ANN) and environmental variables that express soillandscape relationships. This study was carried out in an area of 11,072 ha located in the Barra Bonita municipality, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A soil survey was obtained from a reference area of approximately 500 ha located in the center of the area studied. With the mapping units identified together with the environmental variables elevation, slope, slope plan, slope profile, convergence index, geology and geomorphic surfaces, a supervised classification by ANN was implemented. The neural network simulator used was the Java NNS with the learning algorithm ""back propagation."" Reference points were collected for evaluating the performance of the digital map produced. The occurrence of soils in the landscape obtained in the reference area was observed in the following digital classification: medium-textured soils at the highest positions of the landscape, originating from sandstone, and clayey loam soils in the end thirds of the hillsides due to the greater presence of basalt. The variables elevation and slope were the most important factors for discriminating soil class through the ANN. An accuracy level of 82% between the reference points and the digital classification was observed. The methodology proposed allowed for a preliminary soil classification of an area not previously mapped using mapping units obtained in a reference area. © 2016, Scientia Agricola.

In the absence of an effective vaccine against malaria, strategies for controlling the vector are the main tool for interrupting parasite transmission. Mechanisms of oogenesis and embryogenesis in anautogenous mosquitoes are mainly modulated by blood feeding. However, the expression, at the protein level, of genes involved in such mechanisms in sugar-fed females is unknown. In this work, total protein extracts of the reproductive tract of female An. aquasalis that were fed sugar were analyzed using liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry for protein identification and bioinformatic tools for data mining. We identified 922 proteins expressed in the organ, and using several databases, we attributed biological meaning for several of them. Remarkably, nine proteins involved in oogenesis were identified in females fed sugar. Putative vitellogenins, vitellogenin receptor, lipid storage droplet, transferrin, ferritin, and apolipoprotein, identified here, are proteins involved in egg development. Proteins involved in embryonic development, such as paxillin, exuperantia, several growth factors, and dorsal switch protein, were identified. Interestingly, in this study, we identified 15 peptidases of various classes such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, serine protease, cathepsin, and metalloprotease that could potentially interact with male seminal components.

Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an important task for data stream, as new concepts may appear, disappear or evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems, ND must be treated as a multiclass task, in which, the known concept is composed by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work proposes MINAS, an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a multiclass task. In the initial training phase, MINAS builds a decision model based on a labeled data set. In the online phase, new examples are classified using this model, or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used later to create valid novelty patterns (NP), which are added to the current model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature, using artificial and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed algorithm. © 2015, The Author(s).","Concept evolution; Data streams; Multiclass classification; Novelty detection","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Data communication systems; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Concept evolutions; Data stream; Multi-class classification; Multi-class learning; Novelty detection; Real-life problems; Data mining","de Faria, E.R.; Federal University of UberlândiaBrazil; email: elaine@ufu.br",,"Springer New York LLC",13845810,,,,"English","Data Min.

Organic foods are appreciated by customers because of their benefits to health and friendliness to the environment. However, currently, the most common way for customers to confirm that the organic food they are buying are organic is by certificates and label information, which can be fraudulent. Furthermore, it is interesting to gain insight into organic food composition and visualize which mineral components are fundamental in the differentiation of organic from conventional food. This work addresses these problems using data mining concepts and techniques in a comparative study of organic and conventional food focusing on grape juice, but the proposed methodology can be adapted and employed for analysis of other types of organic food. This article presents a data mining analysis of the elemental composition of 37 grape juice samples collected from different locations in Brazil. The elemental composition of grape juice samples was determined by inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Forty-four elements were determined in the two types of samples, namely organic and conventional grape juice. Special effort was devoted to selecting the variables (elements) that best described each type of grape juice. Predictive models based on support vector machines, neural networks and decision trees were developed to successfully differentiate organic from conventional grape juice samples. We found that, according to the F-score, Chi-square and Random Forest Importance variable selection measures, the components Na, Sn, P, K, Sm and Nd are among the most important variables in the differentiation of organic and conventional grape juice samples. Particularly, the components Na, Sn and K received first, second or third position according to at least two methods. On the other hand, all variable selection methods considered indicated that Ag, Zn, Cr, Be and Pd were among the least important variables for the differentiation of organic and conventional grape juices. SVM yielded an accuracy of 89.18%, both CART and MLP achieved an accuracy of 86.48%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An important share of such increases is due to the introduction of flexible Coding Tree structures, which best configuration is decided through exhaustive tests in a rate-distortion optimization (RDO) scheme. In this work, an early termination method for the decision of such structures was designed using classification trees obtained through Data Mining techniques. The classification trees were trained using intermediate encoding results from a set of video sequences and implemented in the encoder to avoid the full RDO-based decision. An average reduction of 37 % in the HEVC encoder computational complexity was achieved when using the designed classification trees, with a negligible cost of only 0.28 % in terms of Bjontegaard Delta-rate increase. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification trees; Coding trees; Computational complexity; Data mining; Early termination; High efficiency video coding (HEVC)","Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Computational complexity; Data mining; Efficiency; Electric distortion; Image coding; Signal distortion; Signal encoding; Video signal processing; Classification trees; Coding trees; Compression rates; Early termination; Exhaustive tests; High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC); Rate distortion optimization (RDO); Video sequences; Trees (mathematics)","Correa, G.; Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits, Federal University of PelotasBrazil; email: gcorrea@inf.ufpel.edu.br",,"Springer New York LLC",09251030,,AICPE,,"English","Analog Integr Circuits Signal Process",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961203077

There are multiple existing sentiment analysis methods that explore different techniques, usually relying on lexical resources or learning approaches. Despite the large interest on this theme and amount of research efforts in the field, almost all existing methods are designed to work with only English content. Most existing strategies in specific languages consist of adapting existing lexical resources, without presenting proper validations and basic baseline comparisons. In this paper, we take a different step into this field. We focus on evaluating existing efforts proposed to do language specific sentiment analysis. To do it, we evaluated twenty-one methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis proposed for English, comparing them with two language-specific methods. Based on nine language-specific datasets, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of existing multi-language approaches. Our main result suggests that simply translating the input text on a specific language to English and then using one of the existing English methods can be better than the existing language specific efforts evaluated. We also rank those implementations comparing their prediction performance and identifying the methods that acquired the best results using machine translation across different languages. As a final contribution to the research community, we release our codes and datasets. We hope our effort can help sentiment analysis to become English independent. © 2016 ACM.","Machine translation; Multiple languages; Sentiment analysis","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Sentiment analysis; Learning approach; Machine translations; Multilingual sentences; Multiple languages; Prediction performance; Products and services; Research communities; Specific languages; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450337397,,,"English","Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975795253

One of the reasons is human beings' limitations in handling large volumes of data. A common solution for scavenging data from texts are word clouds. A word cloud illustrates word usage in a document by resizing individual words in documents proportionally to how frequently they appear. Even though word clouds are easy to understand, they are not particularly efficient, because they are static. In addition, the presented information lacks context, i.e., words are not explained and they may lead to radically erroneous interpretations. To tackle these problems we developed VCloud, a tool that allows the user to interact with word clouds, therefore allowing informative and interactive data exploration. Furthermore, our tool also allows one to compare two data sets presented as word clouds. We evaluated VCloud using real data about the evolution of gastritis research through the years. The papers indexed by Pubmed related to this medical context were selected for visualization and data analysis using VCloud. A domain expert explored these visualizations, being able to extract useful information from it. This illustrates how can VCloud be a valuable tool for visual text analytics. © 2016 ACM.","Knowledge discovery; Text-mining; Word clouds","Data visualization; Visualization; Domain experts; Interactive data exploration; Knowledge exploration; Text analytics; Text database; Text mining; Unstructured texts; Word clouds; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450337397,,,"English","Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975887127

In these situations, massive data are constantly generated at high speed and their target function can change over time. The proposed method, named Fast Adaptive Stacking of Ensembles (FASE), uses a meta-classifier to combine the predictions from the base classifiers in the ensemble. FASE maintains a set of adaptive learners, in order to deal with concept drifting data. The new algorithm is able to process the input data in constant time and space computational complexity. It only receives as parameters the confidence level for the change detection mechanism and the number of base classifiers. These characteristics make FASE very suitable for learning from non-stationary data streams. We empirically compare the new algorithm with various state-of-the-art ensemble methods for learning in non-stationary data streams. We use a Naïve Bayes classifier and a Perceptron to evaluate the performance of the algorithms over real-world datasets. The experiment results show that FASE presents higher predictive accuracy in the investigated tasks, being also able to bound its computational cost. © 2016 ACM.","Concept drift; Data stream; Ensemble methods; Massive data; Non-stationary data; Online learning","Classification (of information); Metadata; Concept drifts; Data stream; Ensemble methods; Massive data; Nonstationary data; Online learning; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450337397,,,"English","Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975832573

This work aimed to (i) compare two data mining tools, KnowledgeMiner and decision trees, to retrieve legacy soil data from a detailed soil map, (ii) to create and validate the predicted soil maps in the field with the objective to identify the best method for modeling and refining soil maps, (iii) extrapolating soils information to the surrounding similar areas and (iv) to assess the accuracy of this soil map. The study was carried out in Minas Gerais state, Southeastern Brazil. From a detailed soil map, information of 12 terrain attributes was retrieved from the entire polygon of each mapping unit of the map (MUP) and from a circular buffer around the sampled points (CBP). KnowledgeMiner and decision trees were employed to retrieve information per soil class and soil maps were created per method. A field validation of 20 samples was chosen by a cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube sampling scheme and the accuracy of all maps was assessed using a global index, Kappa index, and errors of omission and commission. The KnowledgeMiner MUP map had a greater accuracy than the other methods, being even more accurate than the original map, accounting for 80% of global index and a Kappa index of 0.6524. The information extracted by KnowledgeMiner provided rules for mapping the watershed surroundings with 70.97% of global index and a kappa index of 0.5586. Legacy soil data extracted by KnowledgeMiner from a detailed soil map and used to model soil class distribution outperformed decision trees, promoted improvements on the existing soil map, and allows for the creation of a low cost soil map for the surroundings of the study area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube sampling scheme; Data mining; Digital soil mapping; Fuzzy logic; Knowledge acquisition; Tropical soils","Costs; Decision trees; Forestry; Fuzzy logic; Geometry; Knowledge acquisition; Mapping; Refining; Soil surveys; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Data-mining tools; Digital soil mappings; Environmental conditions; Latin hypercube sampling; Legacy soil datum; Southeastern Brazil; Terrain attributes; Tropical soils; Data mining; accuracy assessment; data mining; digital mapping; environmental conditions; error analysis; fuzzy mathematics; index method; knowledge; map; mapping method; pedology; sampling; soil classification; terrain; tropical soil; Brazil; Minas Gerais","Silva, S.H.G.; Soil Science Department, Federal University of Lavras, P.O.

Measurements of plant physiology are crucial to the calibration of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) that are currently used to simulate the responses of vegetation in face of global changes. In a field work realized in an area of preserved Caatinga forest located in Petrolina, Pernambuco, measurements of carbon assimilation (in response to light and CO2) were performed on 11 individuals of Poincianella microphylla, a native species that is abundant in this region. These data were used to calibrate the maximum carboxylation velocity (Vcmax) used in the INLAND model. The calibration techniques used were Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and data mining techniques as the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and K-MEANS. The results were compared to the UNCALIBRATED model. It was found that simulated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) reached 72% of observed GPP when using the calibrated Vcmax values, whereas the UNCALIBRATED approach accounted for 42% of observed GPP. Thus, this work shows the benefits of calibrating DGVMs using field ecophysiological measurements, especially in areas where field data is scarce or non-existent, such as in the Caatinga. © 2016, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

In particular, trade-off studies for optimum airfoil shape design involving various objectives and design variables require the effective analysis tool to take into account a complexity between objectives and design variables. In this study, for the multiple-conflicting objectives that need to be simultaneously fulfilled, the real-coded Adaptive Range Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm code, which represents the global and stochastic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, was developed for an airfoil shape design. Furthermore, the PARSEC method reflecting geometrical properties of airfoil is adopted to generate airfoil shapes. In addition, the Self-Organizing Maps, based on the neural network, are used to visualize trade-offs of a relationship between the objective function space and the design variable space obtained by evolutionary computation. The Self-Organizing Maps that can be considered as data mining of the engineering design generate clusters of object functions and design variables as an essential role of trade-off studies. The aerodynamic data for all candidate airfoils is obtained through Computational Fluid Dynamics. Lastly, the relationship between the maximum lift coefficient and maximum lift-to-drag ratio as object functions and 12 airfoil design parameters based on the PARSEC method is investigated using the Self-Organizing Maps method. © 2016, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

Existing multilinear detection algorithms for handling N-dimensional data, where N ≥ 3, e.g., the CORe CONsistency DIAgnostic, rely on the CP decomposition which is computationally very expensive. An alternative solution is to rearrange the tensor as a matrix using the unfolding operation and then utilize the eigenvalues of the resultant matrices for CP model order selection. We propose to employ the eigenvalues associated with the unfolding along merged dimensions, namely, the multi-mode eigenvalues, as well as the n-mode eigenvalues for accurate rank detection. These multiple sets of eigenvalues are combined via the information theoretic criterion. By designing a sequential detection scheme starting from the most squared unfolded matrix, the identifiable rank is increased to the square root of the product of all dimension lengths, which renders the detection algorithm to estimate the rank that can exceed any individual dimension length. The conditions under which the proposed multilinear detection algorithm correctly detects the tensor rank are theoretically investigated and its computational efficiency and detection performance are verified. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, those applications produce unbounded sequences of data which cannot be stored for later analysis. Although the importance of this scenario, there are still very few algorithms available in the literature to meet this task. Despite the theoretical foundation of mathematical topology for dealing with high-dimensional spaces, none of those approaches have investigated the problem of finding topologically similar projected clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Among the advantages of topology is the possibility to analyze data in a coordinate-free and noise-robust manner. In a previous research, we have shown that topologically similar clusters can be meaningful considering real-world data sets. In this paper, we extend those ideas and propose PTS, an algorithm for finding topologically similar clusters in high-dimensional data streams. The algorithm is capable of finding traditional projected clusters and then merging them according to topological features computed using persistent homology. Experiments with synthetic data streams of dimensions d=8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 confirm the ability of PTS to find topologically similar projected clusters. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Data clustering; Data streams; Persistent homology; Topological data analysis","Algorithms; Data communication systems; Data mining; Topology; Virtual reality; Curse of dimensionality; Data clustering; Data stream; High-dimensional data streams; Mathematical topologies; Persistent homology; Theoretical foundations; Topological data analysis; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; mathematical analysis; noise; priority journal; Projected Topological Stream clustering algorithm; sensitivity analysis; simulation","Pereira, C.M.M.; Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação - USP, Avenida Trabalhador Sao-carlense, 400 - Centro, Brazil; email: cpereira@icmc.usp.br",,"Elsevier",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958038863

Two study sites, covered predominantly by secondary evergreen rainforest, were surveyed by airborne multispectral high-resolution imagery. These aerophotogrammetric images were acquired at four spectral bands (visible to near-infrared) with spatial resolution of 0.39 m. We evaluated different data input scenarios to suit the object-oriented classification approach. In addition to the four spectral bands, auxiliary products such as band ratios and digital elevation models were considered. Comparisons with traditional pixelbased classifiers were also performed. The results showed that the object-based classification approach yielded a better overall accuracy, ranging from 89% to 91%, than the pixel-based classifications, which ranged from 62% to 63%. The individual classification accuracy of forest-related classes, such as young successional forest stages, benefits the object-based approach. These classes have been reported in the literature as the most difficult to map in tropical environments. The results confirm the potential of object-based classification for mapping procedures and discrimination of successional forest stages and other related land use and land cover classes in complex Atlantic rainforest environments. The methodology is suggested for further SAAPI acquisitions in order to monitor such endangered environment as well as to support National Land and Environmental Management Protocols. © 2016 Taylor and Francis.","data mining; image classification; Remote sensing; secondary forests","airborne sensing; data mining; image classification; image resolution; mapping; multispectral image; rainforest; remote sensing; secondary forest; Atlantic Forest; Brazil","Piazza, G.A.; Department of Forest Engineering, Regional University of BlumenauBrazil; email: gustavoapiazza@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",15481603,,,,"English","GISci.

However, some projects enforce this collaboration model even for changes made by core team developers. This potentially enhances the quality of the repository by adding an inspection step before accepting a contribution into the repository. In this context, though less frequently, the contributions may be rejected. The understanding of the factors that lead to the rejection of these internal contributions is crucial for the improvement of the ways core developers collaborate, having a direct impact on the team productivity.

In addition, we present a qualitative analysis of some cases, helping to understand the patterns that arose from the association rules.

However, given the high label costs, dependence of an expert, limitations in data transmission or even restrictions imposed by the problem's nature, there is a large number of real-world applications in which the availability of actual labels is infinitely delayed (never available). In these cases, it is necessary the use of algorithms that does not follow the traditional process of monitoring the error rate to detect changes in data distribution and uses the most recent labeled data to update the classification model. In this paper, we propose the method MClassification to classify evolving data streams with infinitely delayed labels. Our method is inspired on the use of Micro-Cluster representation from online clustering algorithms. Considering the presence of incremental drifts, our approach uses a distance-based strategy to maintain the Micro-Clusters' positions updated. An evaluation in several synthetic and real data shows that MClassification achieves competitive accuracy results to state-of-the-art methods and adequate computational cost. The main advantage of the proposed method is the absence of critical parameters that require user's prior knowledge, as occurs with rival methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Classification; Data stream; Delayed labels; Extreme verification latency; Online clustering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data communication systems; Data mining; Learning systems; Time delay; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Data stream; Distance-based strategy; Online-clustering; State-of-the-art methods; Synthetic and real data; Verification latencies; Clustering algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509002870,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The non-parametric temporal data modeling can be performed according to local and global approaches. The most of the local prediction data strategies are based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) learning method. In this paper we propose a modification of the kNN algorithm for Time Series prediction. Our proposal differs from the literature by incorporating three techniques for obtaining amplitude and offset invariance, complexity invariance, and treatment of trivial matches. We evaluate the proposed method with six complexity measures, in order to verify the impact of these measures in the projection of the future values. Besides, we face our method with two Machine Learning regression algorithms. The experimental comparisons were performed using 55 data sets, which are available at the ICMC-USP Time Series Prediction Repository.

Incremental learning paradigm is a promising approach for learning in a data stream setting. However, in the presence of concept drifts, outdated concepts can cause misclassifications. Although several incremental Gaussian mixture models methods have been proposed in the literature, we notice that these algorithms lack an explicit policy to discard outdated concepts. In this paper, we propose a new incremental algorithm for data stream learning based on Gaussian Mixture Models. The proposed method is compared to various algorithms widely used in the literature, and the results show that it is competitive with them in various scenarios, overcoming them in some cases. © 2015 IEEE.","concept drift; data stream; Gaussian mixture model; Incremental learning","Algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Data communication systems; Gaussian distribution; Intelligent systems; Object recognition; Classification algorithm; Concept drifts; Data stream; Gaussian Mixture Model; Gaussian mixtures; Incremental algorithm; Incremental learning; Misclassifications; Data mining",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509000166,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

In such cases, we are dealing with distributed data mining problems, in which local models must be individually built and later combined into a consensus, global model. In this paper, we are particularly interested in distributed classification tasks with vertically partitioned data, i.e., when features are distributed among several sources. This restriction implies a challenging scenario given that the development of an accurate model usually requires access to all the features that are relevant for classification. To deal with such a situation, we propose an agent-based classification system, in which the preference orderings of each agent regarding the probability of an instance to belong to the target class are aggregated by means of social choice functions. We employ this method to classify microRNA target genes, an important bioinformatics problem, showing that the predictions derived from the social choice tend to outperform local models in this application. This performance gain is accompanied by other interesting advantages: the aggregation methods herein proposed are extremely simple, do not require transfer of large volumes of data, do not assume an offline training process or parameters setup, and preserve data privacy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Several algorithms to perform transductive classification considering text collections represented in a vector space model have been proposed. However, the use of these algorithms is unfeasible in practical applications due to the independence assumption among instances or terms and the drawbacks of these algorithms. Network-based algorithms come up to avoid the drawbacks of the algorithms based on vector space model and to improve transductive classification. Networks are mostly used for label propagation, in which some labeled objects propagate their labels to other objects through the network connections. Bipartite networks are useful to represent text collections as networks and perform label propagation. The generation of this type of network avoids requirements such as collections with hyperlinks or citations, computation of similarities among all texts in the collection, as well as the setup of a number of parameters. In a bipartite heterogeneous network, objects correspond to documents and terms, and the connections are given by the occurrences of terms in documents. The label propagation is performed from documents to terms and then from terms to documents iteratively. Nevertheless, instead of using terms just as means of label propagation, in this article we propose the use of the bipartite network structure to define the relevance scores of terms for classes through an optimization process and then propagate these relevance scores to define labels for unlabeled documents. The new document labels are used to redefine the relevance scores of terms which consequently redefine the labels of unlabeled documents in an iterative process. We demonstrated that the proposed approach surpasses the algorithms for transductive classification based on vector space model or networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed algorithm effectively makes use of unlabeled documents to improve classification and it is faster than other transductive algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This development has motivated the advancement of research in fault detection, especially based on process history data. Although a large amount of work has been conducted in recent years on the diagnostics of gas turbines, few of them present the use of clustering approaches applied to multivariate time series, adopting PCA similarity factor (SPCA) in order to detect and/or prevent failures. This paper presents a comprehensive method for pattern recognition associated to fault prediction in gas turbines using time series mining techniques. Algorithms comprising appropriate similarity metrics, subsequence matching and fuzzy clustering were applied on data extracted from a Plant Information Management System (PIMS) represented by multivariate time series. A real case study comprising the fault detection in a gas turbine was investigated.

These optimizations interact with each other and with the input code in several and complex ways. The sequence of application of optimization passes can have a significant impact on the performance achieved. The effect of the optimizations is both platform and application dependent. The exhaustive exploration of all viable sequences of compiler optimizations for a given code fragment is not feasible. As this exploration is a complex and time-consuming task, several researchers have focused on Design Space Exploration (DSE) strategies both to select optimization sequences to improve the performance of each function of the application and to reduce the exploration time. In this article, we present a DSE scheme based on a clustering approach for grouping functions with similarities and exploration of a reduced search space resulting from the combination of optimizations previously suggested for the functions in each group. The identification of similarities between functions uses a data mining method that is applied to a symbolic code representation. The data mining process combines three algorithms to generate clusters: The Normalized Compression Distance, the Neighbor Joining, and a new ambiguity-based clustering algorithm. Our experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach address the exploration of optimization sequences in the context of the ReflectC compiler, considering 49 compilation passes while targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, and aiming at performance improvements for 51 functions and four applications. Experimental results reveal that the use of our clustering-based DSE approach achieves a significant reduction in the total exploration time of the search space (20× over a Genetic Algorithm approach) at the same time that considerable performance speedups (41% over the baseline) were obtained using the optimized codes. Additional experiments were performed considering the LLVM compiler, considering 124 compilation passes, and targeting a LEON3 processor. The results show that our approach achieved geometricmean speedups of 1.49×, 1.32×, and 1.24× for the best 10, 20, and 30 functions, respectively, and a global improvement of 7% over the performance obtained when compiling with -O2.","Clustering; Design space exploration; Phase-ordering problem","Codes (symbols); Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Program compilers; Space time codes; Systems analysis; Additional experiments; Clustering; Combination of optimizations; Compiler optimizations; Design space exploration; Genetic algorithm approach; Normalized compression distance; Phase Ordering; Clustering algorithms",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15443566,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

Then, natural gas mass flow rate is calculated by employing an Ultrasonic Flow Meter (UFM), and a volume corrector to convert the given value to its equivalent in standard conditions. As online measurement of natural gas compositions is a costly and difficult task, this study presents an innovative method for natural gas mass flow metering in CGSs. In this method, a novel correlation, which is a functional of only three simple measurable variables i.e. temperature, pressure and sound speed, is presented for calculating natural gas molecular weight, and then, employing the authentic equations of state (EOS) of AGA8 for natural gas, its density could be calculated. The correlation was developed based on curve fitting and data mining approaches on a large database associated with four different natural gas fields of Iran and its accuracy was validated with available experimental data for seven other Iran's natural gas fields and two more gases with sample compositions. Each database in correlation development and validation stage (13 databases altogether) consists of 17,000 sound speed values in all possible temperature and pressure ranges in CGSs after expansion process. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) methods are used to validate the correlation accuracy and compare its performance with the correlation presented previously for the same objective.

We propose new meta-level features especially designed for the sentiment analysis of short messages such as: (i) information derived from the sentiment distribution among the k nearest neighbors of a given short test document x, (ii) the distribution of distances of x to their neighbors and (iii) the document polarity of these neighbors given by unsupervised lexical-based methods. Our approach is also capable of exploiting information from the neighborhood of document x regarding (highly noisy) data obtained from 1.6 million Twitter messages with emoticons. The set of proposed features is capable of transforming the original feature space into a new one, potentially smaller and more informed. Experiments performed with a substantial number of datasets (nineteen) demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed sentiment-based meta-level features is not only superior to the traditional bag-of-word representation (by up to 16%) but is also superior in most cases to state-of-art meta-level features previously proposed in the literature for text classification tasks that do not take into account some idiosyncrasies of sentiment analysis. Our proposal is also largely superior to the best lexicon-based methods as well as to supervised combinations of them. In fact, the proposed approach is the only one to produce the best results in all tested datasets in all scenarios. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.","Meta features; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; Websites; World Wide Web; Bag of words; Feature space; K-nearest neighbors; Lexicon-based; Meta-features; Sentiment analysis; Short message; Text classification; Data mining",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450337168,,,"English","WSDM - ACM Int.

Furthermore, how to visualize such patterns altogether getting insights from the graph to support wise decision-making? Although there are many algorithmic and visual techniques to analyze graphs, none of the existing approaches is able to present the structural information of graphs at large-scale. Hence, this paper describes StructMatrix, a methodology aimed at high-scalable visual inspection of graph structures with the goal of revealing macro patterns of interest. StructMatrix combines algorithmic structure detection and adjacency matrix visualization to present cardinality, distribution, and relationship features of the structures found in a given graph. We performed experiments in real, large-scale graphs with up to one million nodes and millions of edges. StructMatrix revealed that graphs of high relevance (e.g., Web, Wikipedia and DBLP) have characterizations that reflect the nature of their corresponding domains, our findings have not been seen in the literature so far. We expect that our technique will bring deeper insights into large graph mining, leveraging their use for decision making. © 2015 IEEE.","fast processing of large-scale graphs; graph mining; graph sense making; large graph visualization","Data mining; Decision making; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Visualization; Algorithmic structure; Fast Processing; Graph mining; Large graph visualization; Large-scale visualization; Sense making; Structural information; Structure detection; Graph theory",,"Wu X.Tuzhilin A.Xiong H.Dy J.G.Aggarwal C.Zhou Z.-H.Cui P.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467384926,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

We perform a spatio-temporal study of properties of the behavior of these two classes of users (tourists and residents). We have identified, for instance, that some locations have features that are more correlated with the tourists' behavior, and also that even in places frequented by tourists and residents there are clear distinction in the patterns of behavior of these groups of users.

The main problem handled here refers to the behavior of those inducers when it comes to high-dimensional data, more specifically to gene expression data: irrelevant attributes may harm the learning process and many models with similar performance may be generated. In order to treat those problems, we have explored and revised windowing: pruning of the trees generated during intermediary steps of the algorithm; the use of the estimated error instead of the training error; the use of the error weighted according to the size of the current window; and the use of the classification confidence as the window update criterion.

Due to the complexity of maintenance tasks and the time-to-market, developers make poor implementation choices, also known as code smells. Studies indicate that code smells hinder comprehensibility, and possibly increase change- and fault-proneness. Therefore, they must be identified to enable the application of corrections. The challenge is that the inaccurate definitions of code smells make developers disagree whether a piece of code is a smell or not, consequently, making difficult creation of a universal detection solution able to recognize smells in different software projects. Several works have been proposed to identify code smells but they still report inaccurate results and use techniques that do not present to developers a comprehensive explanation how these results have been obtained. In this experimental report we study the effectiveness of the Decision Tree algorithm to recognize code smells. For this, it was applied in a dataset containing 4 open source projects and the results were compared with the manual oracle, with existing detection approaches and with other machine learning algorithms. The results showed that the approach was able to effectively learn rules for the detection of the code smells studied. The results were even better when genetic algorithms are used to pre-select the metrics to use. © 2015 IEEE.","Code Smells; Decision Tree; Genetic Algorithm; Software Quality","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Odors; Open source software; Program debugging; Trees (mathematics); Code smell; Decision-tree algorithm; Detection approach; Experience report; Maintenance tasks; Open source projects; Software Quality; Universal detections; Software reliability",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509004065,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The high growth rate of cities induces imbalances in weather patterns, with negative consequences to the public health. This paper proposes a data mining approach to aid the local urban management team to better understand the consequences resulting from air pollution and its interference within public health in three cities of the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, Brazil. The knowledge gained in this study, which is still in the early phase of data collection, can contribute to the debate on social issues and public policies that can benefit the Brazilian urban management. © 2015 IEEE.","air pollution; component; data mining; respiratory diseases; urban management","Air pollution; Growth rate; Human resource management; Public health; Pulmonary diseases; component; Data collection; High growth rate; Metropolitan regions; Social issues; Urban centers; Urban management; Weather patterns; Data mining",,"Xiao Z.Tong Z.Li K.Wang X.Li K.","IEEE Computer Society",21579555,9781467376792,,,"English","Proc.

These algorithms assume that the items to be clustered are non-stochastic, an assumption not held in many applications. In this work, we present a new probabilistic regionalization algorithm that allows spatially varying random variables as features. Hence, an area highly different from its neighbors can still be considered a member of their cluster if it has a large variance. Our proposal is based on a Bayesian generative spatial product partition model. We build an effective Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out a random walk on the space of all trees and their induced spatial partitions by edges' deletion. We evaluate our algorithm using synthetic data and with one problem of municipalities regionalization based on cancer incidence rates. We are able to better accommodate the natural variation of the data and to diminish the effect of outliers, producing better results than state-of-art approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","Bayesian spatial model; Spatial graphical model; Spatially constrained clustering","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Geographical regions; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Constrained clustering; Geographical area; GraphicaL model; Markov chain monte carlo algorithms; Natural variation; Regionalization algorithms; Spatial clustering; Spatial modeling; Trees (mathematics)",,"Aggarwal C.Zhou Z.-H.Tuzhilin A.Xiong H.Wu X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15504786,9781467395038,,,"English","Proc.

Data streams are, by definition, potentially unbounded sequences of data that arrive intermittently at rapid rates. Extracting useful knowledge from data streams embeds virtually all problems from conventional data mining with the addition of single-pass real-time processing within limited time and memory space. Additionally, due to its ephemeral nature, it is expected that streams undergo changes in its data distribution denominated concept drifts. In this work, we focus on one specific kind of concept drift that has not been extensively addressed in the literature, namely feature drift. A feature drift happens when changes occur in the set of features, such that a subset of features become, or cease to be, relevant to the learning problem. Specifically, changes in the relevance of features directly imply modifications in the decision boundary to be learned, thus the learner must detect and adapt to according to it. Timely detection and recover from feature drifts is a challenging task that can be modeled after a dynamic feature selection problem. In this paper we survey existing work on dynamic feature selection for data streams that acts either implicitly or explicitly. We conclude that there is a need for future research in this area, which we highlight as future research directions. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer hardware description languages; Data communication systems; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Sensor networks; Surveys; Conventional data mining; Decision boundary; Dynamic feature selections; Future research directions; Intrusion Detection Systems; Real world situations; Realtime processing; Stock market analysis; Data mining",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10823409,9781509001637,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

Large-scale ICT interventions can be an option for countries whose regions, both urban and rural, present a high number of digitally excluded people. Our goal was to monitor and identify problems in interventions aimed at certification for a large number of participants in different geographical regions. Our case study is the training at the Telecentros.BR, a program created in Brazil to install telecenters and certify individuals to use ICT resources. We propose an approach that applies social network analysis and mining techniques to data collected from Telecentros.BR dataset and from the socioeconomics and telecommunications infrastructure indicators of the participants' municipalities. We found that (i) the analysis of interactions in different time periods reflects the objectives of each phase of training, highlighting the increased density in the phase in which participants develop and disseminate their projects; (ii) analysis according to the roles of participants (i.e., tutors or community members) reveals that the interactions were influenced by the center (or region) to which the participant belongs (that is, a community contained mainly members of the same region and always with the presence of tutors, contradicting expectations of the training project, which aimed for intense collaboration of the participants, regardless of the geographic region); (iii) the social network of participants influences the success of the training: That is, given evidence that the degree of the community member is in the highest range, the probability of this individual concluding the training is 0.689; (iv) the North region presented the lowest probability of participant certification, whereas the Northeast, which served municipalities with similar characteristics, presented high probability of certification, associated with the highest degree in social networking platform. © 2016 Silva et al.

Experiments were performed with four drift detectors, comparing their results using the values as presented by their original proposals to those using the average of the values returned by the genetic algorithm on multiple datasets containing the same type of concept drifts. Tests were performed in nine artificial datasets, each one with abrupt, slow gradual, and fast gradual concept drifts versions, as well as three real-world datasets.

Due to the increasing of the size of the datasets, techniques for instance selection have been applied for reducing the data to a manageable volume, leading to a reduction of the computational resources that are necessary for performing the learning process. Besides that, algorithms of instance selection can also be applied for removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances, before applying learning algorithms. This step can improve the accuracy in classification problems. In the last years, several approaches for instance selection have been proposed. However, most of them have long runtimes and, due to this, they cannot be used for dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective density-based approach for instance selection. Our approach, called LDIS (local density-based instance selection), evaluates the instances of each class separately and keeps only the densest instances in a given (arbitrary) neighborhood. This ensures a reasonably low time complexity. Our approach was evaluated on 15 well-known data sets and its performance was compared with the performance of 5 state-of-the-art algorithms, considering three measures: accuracy, reduction and effectiveness. For evaluating the accuracy achieved using the datasets produced by the algorithms, we applied the KNN algorithm. The results show that LDIS achieves a performance (in terms of balance of accuracy and reduction) that is better or comparable to the performances of the other algorithms considered in the evaluation © 2015 IEEE.","Data mining; Dataset reduction; Instance reduction; Instance selection; Instance-based learning; Machine learning","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Computational resources; Density-based approaches; Effective density; Instance based learning; Instance selection; Learning process; Pre-processing step; State-of-the-art algorithms; Data reduction",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10823409,9781509001637,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

However, the processing capacity of data mining algorithms is struggling under this growth. One alternative for tackling the problem is to perform instance selection on the data in order to reduce its size, as a preprocessing step for data mining algorithms. This study presents e-MGD, a method for instance selection as an extension of the Markov Geometric Diffusion method, which is a linear complexity method used in computergraphics for the simplification of triangular meshes. The original method was extended so that it was capable of reducing datasets commonly found in the field of data mining. For this purpose, two essential points of adjustment were required. Firstly, it was necessary to build a geometric structure from the data and secondly, to adjust the method so that it could deal with types of attributes encountered within these datasets. These adjustments however, did not influence the complexity of the final e-MGD, since it remained linear, which enabled it to be applied to datasets with a greater number of instances and features. One distinct characteristic of the proposed extension is that it focuses on preserving dataset information rather than improving classification accuracy, as in the case of most instance selection methods. In order to assess the performance of the method, we compared it with a number of classical and contemporary instance selection methods using medium to large datasets, plus a further set of very large datasets. The results demonstrated a good performance in terms of classification accuracy when compared to results from other methods, indicating that the e-MGD is a good alternative for instance selection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Instance selection; Large datasets; Markov geometric diffusion","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Data handling; Diffusion; Geometry; Classification accuracy; Data mining algorithm; Data mining methods; Geometric diffusions; Instance selection; Large datasets; Pre-processing step; Processing capacities; Data mining","Motta, G.H.M.B.; Centro de Informática (CI), Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB)Brazil; email: gustavo@ci.ufpb.br",,"Elsevier",0169023X,,DKENE,,"English","Data Knowl Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957429747

Students should learn by moving gradually from simpler to more complex concepts, promoting deeper levels of learning. This feature is usually embedded in most intelligent learning environments to guide the student in the study of subject matter. The organization of this knowledge structure is usually an intensive effort of human experts, in creating a logical ordering of what is to be taught - determining the concepts and the prerequisite relations among them. In recent years, some methods have been developed for dealing with this knowledge structuring using data coming from logs of learning environments, applying data mining techniques to discover prerequisite rules and create directed graphs of prerequisites. These methods model both assessment items and skills underlying those items. The automatic methods developed so far present a semantic gap between the probabilistic analysis and the expert knowledge, sometimes causing confusion with the results. This research aims to bridge this gap by adding a minimal layer of semantic information to help in the data mining process. As an application, we intend to analyze large-scale assessment datasets, considering its specificities, and evaluate if those hybrid models can improve the prediction of item success. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

The task can be implemented by a particular group of data mining algorithms i.e., those that can identify and extract relevant information from retail databases. Usually it is expected that such algorithms deliver a set of conditional rules, referred to as association rules, each identifying a particular relationship between data items in the database. If the extracted set of rules is representative and sound, it can be successfully used for supporting administrative decisions or for making accurate predictions on new incoming data. This work describes the computational system S_MEMISP+AR, based on the MEMISP approach, and its use in two case studies, defined under different settings, related to the extraction of association rules in a real database from a retail company. Results are analyzed and a few conclusions drawn. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Algorithms; Association rules; Costs; Database systems; Extraction; Intelligent systems; Sales; Accurate prediction; Case-studies; Computational system; Conditional rules; Data mining algorithm; Management decisions; Real database; Retail organizations; Data mining","João, R.S.; UFSCar-DC S.

Bandeirantes, 3900, Monte Alegre, Ribeirão Preto - SP, CEP 14040-901, Brazil","In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering using community detection in complex networks. Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The cluster qualities obtained by the proposed approach not only shows to be competitive with other approaches but also increased its performance using the MapReduce architecture. Another contribution of this work is to bring to light the correlation between the cluster purity and the fitness value obtained during the optimization process.

Assuming that their audience is aware of background and real world events, users can shorten their messages without compromising communication. However, traditional data mining algorithms do not account for contextual information. We argue that exploiting context can lead to advancements in the analysis of social media messages. Recall rate increases if context is taken into account, leading to context-aware methods for filtering messages without resorting only to keywords. A novel approach for subject classification of social media messages, using computational linguistics techniques, is proposed, employing both textual and extra-textual (or contextual) information.

The new sensors are increasingly suited to urban studies, due to the enhancement in spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. Urban environments present high heterogeneity, which cannot be tackled using pixel-based approaches on high resolution images. Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) has been consolidated as a methodology for urban land use and cover monitoring; however, classification of high resolution images is still troublesome. This study aims to assess the improvement on ceramic roof classification using WorldView-2 images due to the increase of 4 new bands besides the standard ""Blue-Green-Red-Near Infrared"" bands. Our methodology combines GEOBIA, C4.5 classification tree algorithm, Monte Carlo simulation and statistical tests for classification accuracy. Two samples groups were considered: 1) eight multispectral and panchromatic bands, and 2) four multispectral and panchromatic bands, representing previous high-resolution sensors. The C4.5 algorithm generates a decision tree that can be used for classification; smaller decision trees are closer to the semantic networks produced by experts on GEOBIA, while bigger trees, are not straightforward to implement manually, but are more accurate. The choice for a big or small tree relies on the user's skills to implement it. This study aims to determine for what kind of user the addition of the 4 new bands might be beneficial: 1) the common user (smaller trees) or 2) a more skilled user with coding and/or data mining abilities (bigger trees). In overall the classification was improved by the addition of the four new bands for both types of users.","C4.5; Ceramic roof; Classification accuracy; Decision tree; GEOBIA; Geographical data mining; WorldView-2","Ceramic materials; Decision trees; Image classification; Infrared devices; Intelligent systems; Land use; Mine roof control; Monte Carlo methods; Remote sensing; Roofs; Semantics; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; C4.5; Classification accuracy; GEOBIA; Geographical data; Worldview-2; Data mining","Brum-Bastos, V.S.; University of St. Andrews, Department of Geography and Sustainable DevelopmentUnited Kingdom; email: vdsbb@st-andrews.ac.uk","Yoshimura M.Ben-Dor E.Zagajewski B.Blaschke T.Potuckova M.Zhang J.Brovelli M.A.Halounova L.Sunar F.Patkova L.Soergel U.Bareth G.Kaasalainen S.Sorgel U.Smit J.Crosetto M.Osmanoglu B.Crespi M.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing",16821750,,,,"English","Int.

It is known that depending on the content of research that is carried out through a ""seeker"" (""search engine"") on the Internet, the result may fall short of the desirable, in terms of quantity and quality of the sites returned. The Dominance principle, subsequent to treatment of the collected information (unstructured data) on the Internet, aimed at revealing patterns (or logical rules) on a set of information and showed how a web content search can become more effective at a significant universe of information. Other techniques and tools have been applied to mining content on the Web, and as shown in this study. The choice of the Dominance principle associated to Rough Set Theory as Multi-criteria decision technique is due to the possibility of inaccurate data (inconsistent) and the need for treatment of these inaccuracies when processing an information system (data table) under a mathematical perspective, and do not need a history of these data. The use of Rough Set Theory and the Dominance principle associated with the probabilistic relationship between conditions and decisions in decision algorithms, is showed by the possibility of there being uncertain data to yield an essential set of effectively consistent information. © 2016 The Author(s).","Dominance principle; Multi-criteria analysis; Rough set theory; Web mining","Data mining; Decision tables; Decision theory; Internet; Search engines; Set theory; World Wide Web; Decision algorithms; Dominance principle; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria approach; Multicriteria decision; Techniques and tools; Unstructured data; Web Mining; Rough set theory","Couto, A.B.G.D.; Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), Av.

The quality of the coffee is evaluated through of sensory test known as cup test, besides the numerical score, tasters can describe using comments and the predominant features. The goal of this study was to characterize sensorially the coffees produced in the Matas de Minas region (Minas Gerais, Brasil), from the comments of the tasters, in two sun exposure face. Sensory quality data of coffees were obtained of 14 municipalities in the region of Matas de Minas, for this were evaluated 234 sample points. The exposed faces studied were Soalheira (exposure to afternoon sunlight) and Noruega (exposure to morning sunlight). In each sample point were collected 3 kg of coffee cherries for subsequent sensory analysis, which was done by three tasters, using the methodology of the CoE (Cup of Excellence) improved by BSCA (Brazil Specialty Coffee Association). In order to analyse the comments we used the Content Analysis Method. In general, it can be observed that independent of the sun exposure face can produce specialty coffee in the region of Matas de Minas. In the faces that were studied the coffees were described with floral or citric aromas, intermediate sweetness, remarkable acidity, prolonged aftertaste, caramel flavor and creamy.","Agriculture; Crop properties; Food materials","Agriculture; Data mining; Sensory analysis; Sensory perception; Coffee cherries; Content analysis method; Crop properties; Food materials; Minas Gerais; Sensory qualities; Sensory tests; Sun exposures; Quality control",,,"American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers",,9781510828759,,,"English","Am.

With the increasing interest in this theme, several methods have been proposed in the literature. Recent efforts have showed that there is no single method that always achieves the best prediction performance for different datasets. Additionally, novel methods have not being extensively compared with other methods and across different datasets, specially methods that are not designed to the English language. Consequently, researchers tend to accept any popular method as a valid methodology to measure sentiments, a practice that is usual in science. In this context, we propose iFeel 2.0, an online web system that implements 19 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods and allows users to easily label a dataset with all of them. iFeel aims at easing the comparison of new methods with baseline approaches and can also be helpful for those interested in using sentiment analysis, allowing them to choose an appropriate sentiment analysis method that works fine for a new dataset. We also incorporate a multiple language feature to allow methods designed for specific languages to be easily compared with a baseline approach that simply translates the input data to English and run these 19 methods. We hope this system can represent an important contribution to this field. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Several methods using different conceptions have been proposed to determine the future configuration of the electric markets. This paper proposes a dynamic model of load expansion, based on concepts of local analysis using ideas and applications from urban poles theory. Thus, the load expansion is simulated in a dynamic way, maintaining a continuous change in the conditions for localization of a new load unit. An algorithm generating a snapshot that represents the distribution system configuration at that instant determines the geometry of the market in a given instant. The proposed dynamic model, based on the urban poles theory, has the capacity for summing up the information from economic variables sets, expressed in terms of interchange flow laws, which are modeled by distance and transportation functions. This supplies the model with the capacity for being used even though the number of available explanatory variables is reduced. © 2016 AECE.","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Load modeling; Power distribution; Urban areas",,"Lambert-Torres, G.; Gnarus InstituteBrazil; email: germanoltorres@gmail.com",,"University of Suceava",15827445,,,,"English","Adv.

More specifically, we tackle the problem of identifying the most common topics in a context of Information Technology audits performed in Brazil since 2011. In order to tackle this problem, we compare two different approaches, supervised and unsupervised learning. On the one hand, the supervised learning approach generated a model that achieved around 73% accuracy for seven categories using random forest. On the other hand, the unsupervised learning approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated a model with five topics, which was considered the best model based on the validation performed by the subject matter experts (SME) from CGU. Nevertheless, it is important to note that both approaches, although implemented independently, generated very similar topics. This also reinforces the success in identifying the main problems found during all these years of IT auditing at CGU using consistent and well-known knowledge discovery methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Auditing; Classification; IT; LDA; Text mining; Topic modeling","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Government data processing; Information systems; Statistics; Supervised learning; Text processing; Unsupervised learning; Auditing; Knowledge discovery method; Latent dirichlet allocations; Subject matter experts; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Supervised learning approaches; Text mining; Topic Modeling; Data mining","Maia, P.; Department of Research and Strategic Information, Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, SAS, Quadra 01, Bloco A, Edifício Darcy Ribeiro, Distrito Federal, Brazil; email: patricia.maia@cgu.gov.br","Francesconi E.Ko A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319441580,,,"English","Lect.

In many sentiment analysis practical scenarios, it is necessary to classify reviews in rates between 1 to 5 stars – a multiclass problem. In literature, we found that the best results for reviews classification are those who propose solutions based on binary splits, achieving accuracies above 90 %. As such, we propose a model, based on the Nested Dichotomies algorithm, that performs multiclass classification in successive steps of binary classification operations. For this classifier to be more effective, we propose that the first split should be defined by identifying users’ recommendation threshold. We present a case study in which this classification model is applied to a set of subjective data extracted from TripAdvisor, discuss the process of determining the first split and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Human centered design; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bins; Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Binary classification; Classification models; Human-centered designs; Multi-class classification; Multi-class problems; Nested dichotomies; Sentiment analysis; User reviews; Data mining","Viterbo, J.; Fluminense Federal University (UFF)Brazil; email: viterbo@ic.uff.br","Meiselwitz G.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319399096,,,"English","Lect.

This type of message has been considered the target of sentiment analysis in many recent studies, since they represent a rich source of opinionated texts. Thus, in order to determine the opinion expressed in tweets, different studies have employed distinct strategies, which mainly include supervised machine learning methods. For this purpose, different kinds of features have been evaluated. Despite that, none of the state-of-the-art studies has evaluated distinct categories of features, regarding their similar characteristics. In this context, this work presents a literature review of the most common feature representation in Twitter sentiment analysis. We propose to group features sharing similar aspects into specific categories. We also evaluate the relevance of these categories of features, including meta-level features, using a significant number of Twitter datasets. Furthermore, we apply important and well-known feature selection strategies in order to identify relevant subsets of features for each dataset. We show in the experimental evaluation that the results achieved in this study, using feature selection strategies, outperform the results reported in previous works for the most of the assessed datasets. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Common features; Experimental evaluation; Literature reviews; Meta levels; Micro-blog; Sentiment analysis; State of the art; Supervised machine learning; Feature extraction",,"Kaminka G.A.Dignum F.Hullermeier E.Bouquet P.Dignum V.Fox M.van Harmelen F.","IOS Press",09226389,9781614996712,,,"English","Front.

Recently, some algorithms have been proposed to cluster data streams as a whole, but just few of them deal with multivariate data streams. Even so, these algorithms merely aggregate the attributes without touching upon the correlation among them. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a new framework to cluster multivariate data streams based on their evolving behavior over time, exploring the correlations among their attributes by computing the fractal dimension. Experimental results with climate data streams show that the clusters' quality and compactness can be improved compared to the competing method, leading to the thoughtfulness that attributes correlations cannot be put aside. In fact, the clusters' compactness are 7 to 25 times better using our method. Our framework also proves to be an useful tool to assist meteorologists in understanding the climate behavior along a period of time. © The Authors.

This paper presents a method for the analysis of occurrences of pairs and groups of species that aims to identify patterns in co-occurrences through the application of association rules of data mining. We propose, implement and evaluate a tool to help ecologists formulate and validate hypotheses regarding co-occurrence between two or more species. To validate our approach, we analyzed the occurrence of species with a dataset from the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Project on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). Three case studies were developed based on this tropical forest to evaluate patterns of positive and negative correlation. Our tool can be used to point co-occurrence in a multi-scale form and for multi-species, simultaneously, accelerating the identification process for the Spatial Point Pattern Analysis.

Field data were collected in six sampling plots with 1,600 m² each. Digital processing utilized three high resolution images (0.39 m) obtained by SAAPI sensor with three visible bands, three near infrared bands, one terrain and one surface model. Extracted data from the digital product (attributes) were used for data mining purposes, selecting the ones with relevance and dismissing those of lesser weight. It was found that both tree and regeneration layers are heterogeneous considering number of individuals (N), diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area (AB). However, significant correlations between forest attributes and field data were found. The higher correlation of N is with the average of the band 1 (-0.64), 3 (-0.62) and IR1 (0.63) for DBH was the ratio of bands IR3 (0.56) and 2 (0.55) and the variable AB was the smallest pixel value of band 1 (-0.64) and IR3 (-0.60). All correlation coefficients were highly significant (p <0.01).

Object-based image analyses and the C4.5 data-mining algorithm were used for automated classification. Classification accuracies were assessed using the kappa index of agreement and the recently proposed allocation and quantity disagreement measures. Four land use and land cover classes were mapped, including Eucalyptus plantations, whose area increased from 4.4% to 8.6%.

Even that, they are categorized by data models. A model associated with the data can promote better strategies for persistence and manipulation of data in the target database. Based on this motivation, the purpose of this paper is to present an approach for logical design of NoSQL document databases that consists a process that converts a conceptual modeling into efficient logical representations for a NoSQL document database. The authors also evaluate their approach and demonstrate that the generated NoSQL logical structures reduce the amount of data items accessed by queries. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents an approach for logical design of NoSQL document database schemas based on a conceptual schema. The authors generate compact and redundancy-free schemas and define appropriate representations in a NoSQL document logical model. The estimated volume of data and workload information can be considered to generate optimized NoSQL document structures. Findings - This approach was evaluated through a case study with an experimental evaluation in the e-commerce application domain. The results demonstrate that the authors' workload-based conversion process improves query performance on NoSQL documents by reducing the number of database accesses. Originality/value - Unlike related work, the reported approach covers all typical conceptual constructs, details a conversion process between conceptual schemas and logical representations for NoSQL document database category and, additionally, considers the estimated database workload to perform optimizations in the logical structure. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is promising. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Extended entity-relationship; NoSQL data modeling; NoSQL document database; NoSQL logical design; Web databases; Workload-driven approach","Data mining; Database systems; Logic design; Query processing; Document database; Entity-relationship; Logical design; Web database; Workload-driven approach; Structural design","Lima, C.; Federal University of Santa CatarinaBrazil; email: claudio.lima@ufsc.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17440084,,,,"English","Int.

To achieve this goal, we apply state-of-the-art computational methods for (1) automatic emotion recognition from facial expressions, (2) extraction of modulations in the participants' speeches and (3) sentiment analysis from the closed caption associated to the videos of interest. More specifically, we compute features, such as, visual intensities of recognized emotions, field sizes of participants, voicing probability, sound loudness, speech fundamental frequencies and the sentiment scores (polarities) from text sentences in the closed caption. Experimental results with a dataset containing 520 annotated news videos from three Brazilian and one American popular TV newscasts show that our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 84% in the sentiments (tension levels) classification task, thus demonstrating its high potential to be used by media analysts in several applications, especially, in the journalistic domain. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In such domains, the occurrence of situations in which instances of a type are specializations of another type is recurrent. This recurrent phenomenon is known in the conceptual modeling community as the powertype pattern. The relevance of the powertype pattern has led to its adoption in many important modeling initiatives, including the UML. To address the challenge of multi-level modeling, we have proposed an axiomatic well-founded theory called MLT. In this paper, we demonstrate how MLT can be used as a reference theory for capturing a number of nuances related to the modeling of the powertype pattern in conceptual modeling. Moreover, we show how this theory can be used to analyze, expose limitations and redesign the UML support for modeling this pattern. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Conceptual modeling; Multi-level modeling; Powertype; UML","Information systems; Systems engineering; Conceptual model; Multilevel model; Multilevels; Multiple Classification; Powertype; Reference theory; Data mining","Carvalho, V.A.; Ontology and Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO), Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)Brazil; email: victorio@ifes.edu.br","Nurcan S.Soffer P.Bajec M.Eder J.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319396958,,,"English","Lect.

These problems are of structural, organizational and financial natures, reflecting the low value attributed to quality and to the actual services in recent surveys of Instituto Data Folha and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Ministério da Saúde).

To rapidly and timely detect in real-time these spatial clusters, algorithms explored grid-based approaches, which segments the spatial domain into discrete cells. The primary benefit of this approach is that it switches the costly distance comparison of density-based algorithms to counting the number of moving objects mapped to each cell. However, during this process, the algorithm may fail to identify clusters of spatially and temporally close moving objects that get mapped to adjacent cells. To overcome this answer loss problem, we propose a density heuristic that is sensible to moving objects in adjacent cells. The heuristic further subdivides each cell into inner slots. Then, we calculate the density of a cell by adding the object count of the cell itself with the object count of the inner slots of its adjacent cells, using a weight function. To avoid collateral effects and detecting incorrect clusters, we apply the heuristic only to transient cells, that is, cells whose density are less than, but close to the density threshold value. We evaluate our approach using real-world datasets and explore how different transient thresholds and the number of inner slots influence the similarity and the number of detected, correct and incorrect, and undetected clusters when compared to the baseline result. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Answer loss on-line spatial clustering; On-line clustering; On-line grid-based spatial clustering; On-line spatial clustering","Algorithms; Big data; Cells; Cytology; Data mining; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Collateral effects; Density-based algorithm; Grid-based approach; Heuristic approach; Online-clustering; Real-world datasets; Spatial clustering; Streaming algorithm; Clustering algorithms","Roriz Junior, M.; Department of Informatics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: mroriz@inf.puc-rio.br","Madria S.Hara T.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319439457,,,"English","Lect.

In addition, it can help to study critical music artists that are in the top rankings and why. With the emergence of new ways in which communities are exposed to music, we see the need to reassess how the popularity of an artist is measured. It is noticed that traditional popularity rankings that model artists based only on disk sales and runs on the radio are not sufficient. The presence of numerous web services that allow user interaction in the world of music, whether listening online or watching the life of an artist more closely in digital media, has changed the dynamics of the music industry. Thus, this work proposes a methodology for music artists comparison based on how they perform on different music digital media available on the web. The methodology is also prepared to allow input data from mass media, so that a study case is presented using the TV media in order to properly assess the popularity of artists.

However, to define the correct spatial relevance of physiognomical features remains a great challenge. It has been proposed recently, with promising results, a statistical spatial mapping technique that highlights the most discriminating facial features using some task driven information from data mining. Such priori information has been employed as a spatial weighted map on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), that uses Chi-Square distance as a nearest neighbour based classifier. Intending to reduce the dimensionality of LBP descriptors and improve the classification rates we propose and implement in this paper two quad-tree image decomposition algorithms to task related spatial map segmentation. The first relies only on split step (top-down) of distinct regions and the second performs the split step followed by a merge step (bottom-up) to combine similar adjacent regions. We carried out the experiments with two distinct face databases and our preliminary results show that the top-down approach achieved similar classification results to standard segmentation using though less regions. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Can it be done in real time? For example, how to cluster decades of frequent measurements of tens of climatic attributes to aid real time alert systems in forecasting extreme climatic events, such as floods and hurricanes? The task of clustering data with many attributes is known as subspace clustering. Today, there exists a need for algorithms of this type well-suited to process multidimensional data streams, for which real time processing is highly desirable. This paper proposes the new algorithm Haliteds - a fast, scalable and highly accurate subspace clustering algorithm for multidimensional data streams. It improves upon an existing technique that was originally designed to process static (not streams) data. Our main contributions are: (1) Analysis of Data Streams: the new algorithm takes advantage of the knowledge obtained from clustering past data to easy clustering data in the present. This fact allows our Haliteds to be considerably faster than its base algorithm, yet obtaining the same accuracy of results; (2) Real Time Processing: as opposed to the state-of-the-art, Haliteds is fast and scalable, making it feasible to analyze streams with many attributes and high frequency of events in real time; (3) Experiments: we ran experiments using synthetic data and a real multidimensional stream with almost one century of climatic data. Our Haliteds was up to 217 times faster than 5 representative works, i.e., its base algorithm plus 4 others from the state-of-the-art, always presenting highly accurate results.

This work develops a multiresolution time series method for extracting patterns in weather records, particular temperature data. The topic is important, as, given a warming climate, morbidity andmortality are expected to rise as heatwave frequency and intensity increase. By analysing summer temperature quantiles at different levels of coarseness, it was found that compounding models can contain a complete description of severe weather events. This new multiresolution quantile approach is developed as an extension of the symbolic aggregate approximation of the temperature time series in which quantiles are computed at every stretch of the piecewise partition. The process is iterated at different scales of the partition, and it was found to be a very useful approach for finding patterns related to both heatwave periods and intensities. The method is successfully tested using real weather records from Brazil (Recife) and the UK (London), and it was found that in both locations heatwave intensity and frequency are increasing at a substantial rate. In addition, it was found that the rate of increase in intensity of the heatwaves is far outstripping the rate of increase in mean summer temperature: by a factor of 2 in Recife and a factor of 6 in London. The approach will be of use to those looking at the impact of future climates on civil engineering, water resources, energy use, agriculture and health care, or those looking for sustained extreme events in any time series. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

When using such models, improved predictions are often attained with the input of extra variables provided by the use of proximal sensors, such as magnetometers and portable X-ray fluorescence scanners (pXRF). This work aimed to evaluate the efficiency of such tools for mapping soil classes and properties in tropical conditions. Soils were classified and sampled at 39 locations in a regular-grid design with a 200-m distance between samples. A pXRF and a magnetometer were used in all samples, and DTM values were obtained for every sampling site. Through visual analysis, boxplots were used to identify the best variables for distinguishing soil classes, which were further mapped using fuzzy logic. The map was then validated in the field. An ordinary least square regression model was used to predict sand and clay contents using DTM, pXRF and the magnetometer as predicting variables. Variables obtained with pXRF showed a greater ability for predicting soil classes (overall accuracy of 78% and 0.67 kappa index), as well as for estimating sand and clay contents than those acquired with DTM and the magnetometer. This study showed that pXRF offers additional variables that are key for mapping soils and predicting soil properties at a detailed scale. This would not be possible using only DTM or magnetic susceptibility. © 2016 by the authors.","Data mining; Fuzzy logics; Magnetic susceptibility; Ordinary least square multiple linear regression; Portable X-ray fluorescence scanner","Data mining; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Linear regression; Magnetic susceptibility; Magnetometers; Mapping; Scanning; Soil surveys; X ray spectrometers; X rays; Digital soil mappings; Digital terrain model; Multiple linear regressions; Ordinary least squares; Overall accuracies; Portable x-ray fluorescence; Proximal sensing; Tropical conditions; Soils","Curi, N.; Department of Soil Science, Federal University of Lavras, P.O.

Buzzwords are fashionable words that continue gaining popularity until a tipping point is reached and then their popularity declines. Our goal in this study is to identify buzzwords through their frequency of occurrence over the years, using two clustering techniques: k-means and the self-organizing map (SOM). We also used the DBLP database to run experiments with data from published papers in an attempt to find terms that could be classified as buzzwords, in accordance with the defined meaning. Clusters generated by both k-means and SOM are very similar, indicating that it is very likely that buzzwords were correctly identified as such. We were able to identify terms such as ""android"" and ""mapreduce"", which were clearly buzzwords for 2012, as well as terms such as ""pomdp"", which was not an obvious buzzword. As a contribution, we highlight common characteristics identified for buzzwords and make comparisons between the two methods for finding buzzwords which were analyzed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The data can present noises and contain sparse patterns hide in a huge amount of information. The knowledge extracted from environmental sensor data can have many applications: indicate climate changes, risk of ecologic catastrophes and help to determine environment degradation in face of humans actions. However, there is a lack of methods that can handle this kind of data. Based on that, we proposed IncMSTS-PP: an incremental algorithm that finds sequential sparse patterns and enhances them semantically facilitating the interpretation. IncMSTS-PP implements STW-method to extract stretchy patterns (patterns with time gaps) in data with noises. The enhancement use post-processing method that generalizes the patterns using the fuzzy ontology knowledge. Our experiment shows that IncMSTS-PP extracts 2.3 times more relevant sequences than traditional algorithms in sensor domain. The post-processing summarizes the patterns reducing to 22.47% of the original number of patterns. In conclusion, IncMSTS-PP is efficient and reliable in the extraction of significant sequences from sensor data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Data mining; Fuzzy ontology; Real data; Sequence generalization","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Extraction; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Processing; Amount of information; Environmental sensor; Fuzzy ontology; Incremental algorithm; Postprocessing methods; Real data; Sequence generalization; Sequential patterns; Data mining","Silveira, C.R.; Federal University of São Carlos, Washington Luí km 235, Brazil; email: carlosjr@dc.ufscar.br","Perner P.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319419190,,,"English","Lect.

The automatic detection of tactile paving surface is one important topic of research, not only to help the mobility of visually impaired persons, but also for use in the displacement of autonomous robots, providing a safely route and warnings. In this paper we propose an approach for tactile paving surface detection in realtime with the purpose to assist visually impaired persons. It uses computer vision algorithms combined with decision tree to eliminate some possible false alarms. We assume the visually impaired persons holds a smartphone, which is used to obtain images, as well as to assist him by audio feedback to keep it on the tactile paving surface. This problem is very challenging, mainly due to illumination changes, occlusion, image noise and resolution, as well as different possible colors of the tactile paving surfaces. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach works well in low resolution images, effectively detecting the tactile paving surfaces in real test scenarios. © The Authors.

However, it is more concise than free text and may limit specialists’ descriptions of important findings not covered by pre-defined structures. A computational ontological structure derived from free texts designed by specialists may be a solution for this problem. Therefore, the goal of our study was to develop a methodology for structuring information in radiology reports covering specifications required for the Brazilian Portuguese language, including the terminology to be used. Methods: We gathered 1,701 radiological reports of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the lumbosacral spine from three different institutions. Techniques of text mining and ontological conceptualization of lexical units extracted were used to structure information. Ten radiologists, specialists in lumbosacral MRI, evaluated the textual superstructure and terminology extracted using an electronic questionnaire. Results: The established methodology consists of six steps: 1) collection of radiology reports of a specific MRI examination; 2) textual decomposition; 3) normalization of lexical units; 4) identification of textual superstructures; 5) conceptualization of candidate-terms; and 6) evaluation of superstructures and extracted terminology by experts using an electronic questionnaire. Three different textual superstructures were identified, with terminological variations in the names of their textual categories. The number of candidate-terms conceptualized was 4,183, yielding 727 concepts. There were a total of 13,963 relationships between candidate-terms and concepts and 789 relationships among concepts. Conclusions: The proposed methodology allowed structuring information in a more intuitive and practical way. Indications of three textual superstructures, extraction of lexicon units and the normalization and ontologically conceptualization were achieved while maintaining references to their respective categories and free text radiology reports. © Schattauer 2016.","Free-text; Ontology; Radiological report; Structured report; Terminology","controlled vocabulary; data mining; human; natural language processing; nomenclature; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; questionnaire; radiology; research; Data Mining; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Natural Language Processing; Radiology; Research Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled","Muglia, V.F.; Universidade de Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Internal Medicine, Av Bandeirantes 3900, Campus Monte Alegre, Brazil; email: fmuglia@fmrp.usp.br",,"Schattauer GmbH",18690327,,,"27580980","English","Appl.

This kind of hybridization has been successfully explored to solve several optimization problems, for which the solutions and their patterns are limitedly characterized by sets of elements.

We therefore propose a hybrid data mining heuristic to solve the one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem, for which solutions are defined by sequences of elements. Computational experiments, conducted on a set of instances from the literature, showed that the hybrid heuristic reached better-costs solutions faster than the original strategy. This way, it was evidenced that not only problems whose solutions are represented by sets of elements can benefit from the hybridization of metaheuristics with data mining, but also problems whose solutions are represented by a sequence of elements. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

So we propose to use a data mining technique to help us in this task. As a case of study, we analyzed the brain's behaviour of blind people and sighted people in a spatial activity. There is a common belief that blind people compensate their lack of vision using the other senses. If an object is given to sighted people and we asked them to identify this object, probably the sense of vision will be the most determinant one. If the same experiment was repeated with blind people, they will have to use other senses to identify the object. In this work, we propose a methodology that uses decision trees (DT) to investigate the difference of how the brains of blind people and people with vision react against a spatial problem. We choose the DT algorithm because it can discover patterns in the brain signal, and its presentation is human interpretable. Our results show that using DT to analyze brain signals can help us to understand the brain's behaviour. © 2016 Narusci S.

However, its quadratic time complexity may hamper its use, mainly in the analysis of large time series data. All the recent advances in speeding up the exact DTW calculation are confined to similarity search. However, there is a significant number of important algorithms including clustering and classification that require the pairwise distance matrix for all time series objects. The only techniques available to deal with this issue are constraint bands and DTW approximations. In this paper, we propose the first exact approach for speeding up the all-pairwise DTW matrix calculation. Our method is exact and may be applied in conjunction with constraint bands. We demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the runtime in approximately 50% on average and up to one order of magnitude in some datasets.

These deposits vary unrelated to obesity, which reinforces its direct segmentation for further quantification. However, manual segmentation of these fats has not been widely deployed in clinical practice due to the required human workload and consequential high cost of physicians and technicians. In this work, we propose a unified method for an autonomous segmentation and quantification of two types of cardiac fats. The segmented fats are termed epicardial and mediastinal, and stand apart from each other by the pericardium. Much effort was devoted to achieve minimal user intervention. The proposed methodology mainly comprises registration and classification algorithms to perform the desired segmentation. We compare the performance of several classification algorithms on this task, including neural networks, probabilistic models and decision tree algorithms. Experimental results of the proposed methodology have shown that the mean accuracy regarding both epicardial and mediastinal fats is 98.5% (99.5% if the features are normalized), with a mean true positive rate of 98.0%.

Due to the high degree of cysteine conservation, novel members from this peptide family can be identified in protein databases through a search through regular expression (REGEX). In this work, six novel cyclotide-like precursors from the Poaceae were identified from NCBI's non-redundant protein database by the use of REGEX. Two out of six sequences (named Zea mays L and M) showed an Asp residue in the C-terminal, which indicated that they could be cyclic. Gene expression in maize tissues was investigated, showing that the previously described cyclotide-like Z. mays J is expressed in the roots. According to molecular dynamics, the structure of Z. mays J seems to be stable, despite the putative absence of cyclization. As regards cyclotide evolution, it was hypothesized that this is an outcome from convergent evolution and/or horizontal gene transfer. The results showed that peptide screening from databases should be performed periodically in order to include novel sequences, which are deposited as the databases grow. Indeed, the advances in computational and experimental methods will together help to answer key questions and reach new horizons in defense-related peptide identification. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","data mining; molecular dynamics; phylogenetic analysis; regular expression","Amino acids; Covalent bonds; Data mining; Gene expression; Gene transfer; Genes; Grain (agricultural product); Molecular dynamics; Pattern matching; Peptides; Proteins; Computational analysis; Convergent evolution; Cyclized peptides; Experimental methods; Horizontal gene transfer; Peptide identification; Phylogenetic analysis; Regular expressions; Database systems; cyclotide; cyclotide; Article; convergent evolution; data mining; gene expression; horizontal gene transfer; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; peptide analysis; phylogeny; plant genetics; Poaceae; protein database; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; structure analysis; amino acid sequence; chemistry; maize; Poaceae; protein database; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Cyclotides; Databases, Protein; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Poaceae; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Zea mays","Franco, O.L.; Centro de Análises Proteômicas e Bioquímicas, Põs-Graduação em Ciências Genômicas e Biotecnologia, Universidade Catõlica de BrasíliaBrazil; email: ocfranco@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",00063525,,BIPMA,"26572696","English","Biopolymers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961328974

This provides little information about the places where people are infected, the truly important information for disease control. The recent availability of spatial data generated by geotagged social media posts offers a unique opportunity: by identifying and following diseased individuals, we obtain a collection of sequential geo-located events, each sequence being issued by a social media user. The sequence of map positions implicitly provides an estimation of the users’ social trajectories as they drift on the map. The existing data mining techniques for spatial cluster detection fail to address this new setting as they require a single location to each individual under analysis. In this paper we present two stochastic models with their associated algorithms to mine this new type of data. The Visit Model finds the most likely zones that a diseased person visits, while the Infection Model finds the most likely zones where a person gets infected while visiting. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed models by applying them to more than 100 million geotagged tweets from Brazil in 2015. In particular, we target the identification of infection hot spots associated with dengue, a mosquitotransmitted disease that affects millions of people in Brazil annually, and billions worldwide. We applied our algorithms to data from 11 large cities in Brazil and found infection hot spots, showing the usefulness of our methods for disease surveillance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Disease surveillance; Hot spots; Social media; Spatial cluster detection; Trajectories","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Disease control; Health risks; Learning systems; Monitoring; Social networking (online); Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Trajectories; Disease surveillance; Health surveillances; High-risk zones; Hot spot; Infection models; Single location; Social media; Spatial cluster; Stochastic models","Souza, R.C.S.N.P.; Department of Computer Science, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: nalon@dcc.ufmg.com","Landwehr N.Giuseppe J.Manco G.Frasconi P.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319462264,,,"English","Lect.

Its estimation tends to be a complex process, owing to the diversity of factors affecting it. One of those factors is property location, which embraces the geographic relationship between the property and the surrounding local amenities. Hedonic modelling is frequently applied to estimate the value of a property; to consider the influence of property location within such models, the region under analysis is usually divided into homogeneous areas. This division can introduce a bias (a particular vision) related to the modifiable areal unit problem. Our intent in this paper is to apply data mining techniques to address a possible valuer bias, a particular valuer's vision, in the current City of Calgary assessment model. Employing the decision tree technique, one locational attribute (Sub-Neighbourhood) was represented by the (x, y) coordinates of the properties, with approximately 96% correct classification with respect to their City of Calgary sub-neighbourhood designation. By adopting the regression tree technique, we show that it is possible to explain approximately 73% variability of the Sale Price attribute, using only the attribute Sub-Neighbourhood or the (x, y) coordinates as input. In general, the results showed a consistent relationship between property value and location. Additionally, the sale price patterns of actual properties do not conform strictly to the politico-administrative units adopted by the city. Those patterns usually cross the unit boundaries limits or are mixed inside a unit. Our results suggest that using a property's spatial coordinates, instead of political-administrative subdivisions, to express its location, would lead to more accurate results and not incur the possibility of bias. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.","Canada; Data mining; Econometry; Economic appraisal; House price; Local government; Locational influence; Neighbourhood; Property assessment; Real estate market; Regression trees; Spatial analysis","data mining; econometrics; housing market; identification method; location-allocation model; neighborhood; property market; residential location; Alberta; Calgary; Canada",,,"Geographie-Cites",12783366,,,,"English","CyberGeo",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976328192

Recently, studies have shown that most of existing algorithms for learning from data streams do not encompass techniques for a specific kind of drift: feature drifts. Feature drifts occur when features become, or cease to be, relevant to the learning task. In this paper, we propose an extension to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, so its distances' computations are weighted according to their current discriminative power. On our proposal, the discriminative power of features is given by entropy, which is swiftly computed over a sliding window. Empirical evidence shows that our approach is able to overcome several existing algorithms in accuracy and feature drift adaptation, while at the expense of bounded processing time and memory space. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Discriminative power; Dynamic features; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Processing time; Sliding Window; Weighted k-nearest neighbors; Learning algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10514651,9781509048472,PICRE,,"English","Proc.

In this context, a lot of effort has been put on the extraction of useful patterns from streaming scenarios. Learning from data streams embeds a variety of problems, and by far, the most challenging is concept drift, i.e. changes in data distribution. In this paper, we focus on a specific type of drift uncommonly assessed in the literature: feature drifts. Feature drifts occur whenever a subset of features becomes, or ceases to be, relevant to the concept to be learned. We propose and review several feature drifting data stream generators and use them to benchmark state-of-the-art data stream classification algorithms and their combination with drift detectors. Results show that, although drift detectors enable slight quicker recovery to feature drifts, best results are obtained by Hoeffding Adaptive Tree, the only learner that performs dynamic feature selection as streams progress. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Feature extraction; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Data generation; Data stream classifications; Drift detectors; Dynamic feature selections; State of the art; Useful patterns; Classification (of information)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10514651,9781509048472,PICRE,,"English","Proc.

On the other hand, the study also reveals that new correlations between items, even though not classified by Last.fm, can be discovered, showing that even large-scale collaborative systems as Last.fm are not complete regarding data characterization for extracting abstract similarity concepts.","Data mining; Music; Similarity analysis","Distributed computer systems; Filtration; Information systems; Radio broadcasting; Radio stations; Co-occurrence analysis; Data characterization; Frequent item sets; Large scale collaborative systems; Music; Music Recommendation System; New correlations; Similarity analysis; Data mining",,"Cappelli C.Vilain P.Wazlawick R.S.Siqueira F.A.","Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis - UFSC/Departamento de Informatica e Estatistica",,9788576693178,,,"Portuguese","SBSI - Braz.

Soil maps were used at the scale of 1:50,000, for the watersheds of the rivers Santo Cristo and Arroio Portao, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and the extrapolation was done using the ""Simple Cart"" decision tree algorithm, trained in the previously mapped areas. The watersheds were divided into two parts, one used for model training and the other for model validation. From the digital elevation model Aster-GDEM, seven maps of soil predicting variables in the landscape were generated. Sampling was random and performed with sampling density of three points per hectare. Model training was performed in the Weka software, and model accuracies were calculated using the error matrix. For both watersheds, the overall accuracy of the predicted soil map was higher in the training area than in the validation area, and showed values of 50 and 54%. The maps produced by the predictive model showed acute differences in the spatial distribution of mapping units, compared with the original soil map, indicating that the used digital mapping technique has low effectivity for the extrapolation of pre-existing soil maps to other physiographically similar areas.","Data mining; Decision trees; Geographic information system; Overall accuracy; Pedometrics; Simple cart",,,,"Embrapa",0100204X,,,,"Portuguese","Pesqui.

However, the huge amount of alerts that an IDS triggers and their low-level representation make the alerts analysis a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on hierarchical clustering that supports intrusion alert analysis in two main steps. First, it correlates historical alerts to identify the most typical strategies attackers have used. Then, it associates upcoming alerts in real time according to the strategies discovered in the first step. The experiments were performed using a real data set from the University of Maryland. The results show that the proposed approach can provide useful information for security administrators and may reduce the time between a security event and the response.","Alert correlation; Data mining; Intrusion detection; Security management","Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Industrial management; Information systems; Information use; Network security; Alert correlation; Hier-archical clustering; Intrusion alert correlation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low level representation; Security administrator; Security management; University of Maryland; Intrusion detection",,"Cappelli C.Wazlawick R.S.Siqueira F.A.Vilain P.","Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis - UFSC/Departamento de Informatica e Estatistica",,9788576693178,,,"English","SBSI - Braz.

However, a deeper review of the literature has failed to present techniques dealing with database information techniques capable of obtaining classifications for school performance; nor is there a consensus regarding the definition of ""educational quality"". To address the situation, in this paper, we propose a methodology that fits the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process to classify teaching in schools. This is done by comparing the grades of the ""Prova Brasil"", which is part of the Development Index of Basic Education (IDEB) in Brazil. To illustrate the methodology, it was applied to 17public elementary schools in the municipality of Araucária, located in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Parana state. The grades achieved by all students of the initial years (1st to 5th year of fundamental teaching) and final years (6th to 9th years of fundamental teaching) were considered. In the Data Mining phase, the main phase of the KDD process, three techniques were used comparatively: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Genetic Algorithms. Those techniques presented acceptable results in classifying each school represented by a ""Performance Classification Label"". Based on this label, the educational managers can have a greater input for procedures to be adopted in each school, and thus set more accurate targets.","KDD process; Pattern recognition; Real case study; School performance","Data mining; Education; Genetic algorithms; Managers; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Classification labels; Database information; Educational qualities; Elementary schools; Knowledge discovery in database; Metropolitan regions; Real case; School performance; Classification (of information)",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1478422X,,,,"English; Portuguese","Corros.

In IE domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) are two important tasks. The former aims at finding named instances, as peoplés names, locations, among others, whereas the latter consists detecting and characterizing relations among such named entities in text. Most of the state-of-the-art supervised learning methods for NER and RE relies on statistical machine learning techniques with higher accurate results for NER than RE. These statistical machine learning techniques typically uses a propositional hypothesis space for representing examples, i.e., an attribute-value representation. Such representation presents some limitations particularly to the extraction of complex relations, which demand more semantic resources, and mainly contextual information about the involving instances. In this paper, we present an IE system, named OntoILPER, permitting to extract both entity and relation instances from textual document in english. This system, not only benefits from a domain ontology as semantic resource, but also takes advantage of a higher expressive relational hypothesis space for representing examples whose structure is relevant to the task at hand. OntoILPER induces extraction rules that subsume examples of entities and relation instances from a specific graph-based model of sentence representation. Moreover, the system enables the application of domain ontologies and further ground knowledge in the form of relational features. In addition, this paper presents several experiments with OntoILPER on NER and RE using the TREC reference corpus, and compare these results to other state-of-the-art IE systems. © Lavoisier 2016.","Entity and relation extraction; Inductive logic programming; Ontology population; Ontology-based information extraction; Symbolic machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Data mining; Digital libraries; Graphic methods; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Automatic information extraction; Named entity recognition; Ontology Population; Ontology-based information extraction; Relation extraction; Statistical machine learning; Supervised learning methods; Symbolic machine learning; Inductive logic programming (ILP)",,,"Lavoisier",0992499X,,,,"French","Rev.

The OPF-CI classifier is a parameter-free, graphbased approach to incremental training that runs in linear time with respect to the number of instances. Our results show OPF-CI keeps the running time low while producing an accuracy behavior similar to the other classifiers for increments of instances.

In this paper we review some approaches to SQL query mining, apply the traditional techniques used in the literature and present lessons learned, namely, that the general text mining approach for feature extraction and clustering does not seem to be adequate for this type of data, and, most importantly, we find that this type of analysis can result in very different queries being clustered together. © 2016 SPIE.","SQL; Text Mining; Web Logs","Feature extraction; Surveys; User interfaces; Complex queries; Internet portals; Scientific education; Sloan Digital Sky Survey; Text mining; Traditional techniques; Usage patterns; Weblogs; Data mining","Santos, R.; National Institute for Space Research, Avenida Dos Astronautas, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil; email: rafael.santos@inpe.br","Broome B.D.Hanratty T.P.Llinas J.Hall D.L.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510600928,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989295986

In this case, it is extremely difficult to have control over all stages of the development process. Many researchers have approached ways to identify aspects, whether social or technical, that have some impact on the success or failure of software. Despite the large number of results found, there is still no consensus among which types of attributes have a greater success impact. Thus, after identifying technical and socio-technical factors that influence the success of OSS using data-mining techniques in about 20.000 projects data from GitHub, this study aims to compare them in order to identify those which most influence in determining the success of an OSS project. The results show that it is possible to identify the status (active or dormant) in more than 90% of the cases based, mainly, in social attributes of the project. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Classification methods; Development process; Social attributes; Social factor; Sociotechnical; Data mining","Anjos, E.; CISUC, Centre for Informatics and Systems, University of CoimbraPortugal; email: eudisley@ci.ufpb.br","Misra S.Gervasi O.Torre C.M.Taniar D.Stankova E.Rocha A.M.A.C.Wang S.Murgante B.Apduhan B.O.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319420912,,,"English","Lect.

Considering the consolidation of the internet and the improvement of the interaction, searching, and learning mechanisms, we propose a generic architecture, called CaVa, to create virtual Learning Spaces building up on cultural institution documents. More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. © 2016 The Authors.

There are research centers that collect, store and create indexes of agricultural activities, providing multidimensional time series composed by years of data. In this paper, we are interested in studying the behavior of these time series, especially in what regards the evolution of agricultural price indexes over the years. We explore data mining techniques tailored to analyze temporal data, aiming to generate spatio-temporal trajectories of grains price indexes for six years of data. We propose the use of Tucker decomposition to both analyze the temporal patterns of these price indexes and map trajectories that represent their behavior over time in a concise and representative low-dimensional subspace.

State-of-the-art NERC systems are based on supervised machine learning and hence need to be trained on (manually) annotated corpora. However, annotated corpora hardly exist for non-standard languages and labeling additional data manually is tedious and costly. In this article, we present a novel method to automatically generate (partially) annotated corpora for NERC by exploiting the link structure of Wikipedia. Firstly, Wikipedia entries in the source language are labeled with the NERC tag set. Secondly, Wikipedia language links are exploited to propagate the annotations in the target language. Finally, mentions of the labeled entities in the target language are annotated with the respective tags. The procedure results in a partially annotated corpus that is likely to contain unannotated entities. To learn from such partially annotated data, we devise two simple extensions of hidden Markov models and structural perceptrons. Empirically, we observe that using the automatically generated data leads to more accurate prediction models than off-the-shelf NERC methods. We demonstrate that the novel extensions of HMMs and perceptrons effectively exploit the partially annotated data and outperforms their baseline counterparts in all settings. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Cybernetics; Data mining; Hidden Markov models; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Markov processes; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Accurate prediction; Automatically generated; Baseline counterparts; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Question Answering; State of the art; Supervised machine learning; Big data","Brefeld, U.; Leuphana University of LüneburgGermany; email: brefeld@leuphana.de","Janssen F.Chin A.Atzmueller M.Trattner C.Schweizer I.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319290089,,,"English","Lect.

The perceived inability of some models to deal with the challenges of processing high-dimensional data, however, limits the accurate characterisation of these subtypes. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset. Findings: In this study, we employed the CM1 score to identify the most discriminative probes for each group, and an ensemble learning technique to assess the ability of these probes on assigning subtype labels using 24 different classifiers. Our analysis is comprised of an iterative computation of these methods and statistical measures performed on a set of over 2000 samples. The refined labels assigned using this iterative approach revealed to be more consistent and in better agreement with clinicopathological markers and patients' overall survival than those originally provided by the PAM50 method. Conclusions: The assignment of intrinsic subtypes has a significant impact in translational research for both understanding and managing breast cancer. The refined labelling, therefore, provides more accurate and reliable information by improving the source of fundamental science prior to clinical applications in medicine. © 2015 Milioli et al.","Breast cancer; Classifiers; CM1 score; Data mining; Ensemble learning; Feature selection; Intrinsic subtypes; METABRIC; Predictor models; Subtype prediction","Article; basal like breast cancer; breast cancer; breast cancer intrinsic subtype; cancer classification; cancer survival; class prediction; classifier; clinicopathological marker; CM1 score; controlled study; data mining; disease marker; ensemble learning; genetic database; HER2 enriched breast cancer; human; inconsistent breast cancer; luminal A breast cancer; luminal B breast cancer; machine learning; normal like breast cancer; overall survival; PAM50 breast cancer intrinsic classifier; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; statistical analysis; statistical concepts; survival rate; survival time; transcriptomics; validation process","Moscato, P.; Priority Research Centre for Bioinformatics, Biomarker Discovery and Information-Based Medicine, Hunter Medical Research Institute, Lot 1, Kookaburra Circuit, Australia; email: Pablo.Moscato@newcastle.edu.au",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17560381,,,,"English","BioData Min.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027939879
