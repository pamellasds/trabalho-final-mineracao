In this context, understanding and modeling opinions, as well as opinion-leaders, have implications for several tasks, such as recommendation, advertising, brand evaluation etc. Despite the intrinsic relation between opinions and opinion-leaders, most recent works focus exclusively on either understanding the opinions, by Sentiment Analysis (SA) proposals, or identifying opinion-leaders using Influential Users Detection (IUD). This paper presents a preliminary evaluation about a combined analysis of SA and IUD. In this sense, we propose a methodology to quantify factors in real domains that may affect such analysis, as well as the potential benefits of combining SA Methods with IUD ones. Empirical assessments on a sample of tweets about the Brazilian president reveal that the collective opinion and the set of top opinion-leaders over time are inter-related. Further, we were able to identify distinct characteristics of opinion propagation, and that the collective opinion may be accurately estimated by using a few top-k opinion-leaders. These results point out the combined analysis of SA and IUD as a promising research direction to be further exploited. © 2016 IEEE.","Influential Users Detection; Sentiment Analysis","Decision making; Combined analysis; Decision making process; Empirical assessment; Influential users; Intrinsic relation; Potential benefits; Products and services; Sentiment analysis; Data mining",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES: MCT/CNPq573871/2008-6

Sentiment analysis is one method of aggregating overall polarity (positive or negative) towards a topic. However, most sentiment analysis methods rely on text processing, thus ignoring the large amount of image data present in popular social networks. The primary aim of this study is to exploit image data in conjunction with text and to evaluate this integrated approach for sentiment analysis for transportation. This study used image, captions, and comments data from the Instagram social network that were marked as being relevant to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and attempted to predict the expressed sentiment towards this agency. A set of high-level features were extracted from images using the web-based Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. These features included the detection of faces and 86 categories which describe the images. Text features included the set of individual words and structural features. The experiment results of different machine learning techniques show a gain in precision when images and texts are combined compared to text-only approaches, thus confirming the relevance of visual content usage. The precision reaches a performance close to human classification agreement (typically approximately 80%). However, the results do not indicate that visual features are more informative than text features. © 2016 IEEE.","Classification; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Public transportation; Sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Image analysis; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; California department of transportations; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Public transportation; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Transportation agencies; Two way communications; Transportation",,,,,,,,"Bregman, S., Uses of social media in public transportation (2012) Transportation Research Board, 99; Schweitzer, L., Planning and social media: A case study of public transit and stigma on twitter (2014) Journal of the American Planning Association, 80 (3), pp. 218-238; Liu, B., Zhang, L., A survey of opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2012) Mining Text Data, pp. 415-463. , Springer; Wojtowicz, J., Wallace, W.A., The use of social media by transportation agencies for traffic management (2016) Transportation Research Board 95th Annual Meeting, No. 16-6217; Chen, F., Krishnan, R., Transportation sentiment analysis for safety enhancement (2013) Carnegie Mellon University, Tech.

MuSSE is a tool developed to extract XML data from sprite sheet images with non-uniform - multi-sized - sprites. MuSSE (Multi-sized Sprite Sheet meta-data Exporter) is based on a Blob detection algorithm that incorporates a connected-component labeling system. Hence, blobs of arbitrary size can be extracted by adjusting component connectivity parameters. This image detection algorithm defines boundary blobs for each individual sprite in a sprite sheet. Every specific blob defines a sprite characteristic within the sheet: position, name and size, which allows for subsequent data specification for each blob/image. Several examples on real images illustrate the performance ofthe proposed algorithm and working tool. © 2016 IEEE.","Blob detection; Development tool; Sprite sheet","Data mining; Image processing; Metadata; Signal detection; Blob detection; Connected component labeling; Data specifications; Development tools; Image detection; Non-uniform; Real images; Sprite sheet; Computer games",,,,,,,,"Damiani, E.B., (2014) Programação de Jogos Android: Crie Seu Próprio Game Engine!, , Novatec Editora; Shneier, D., Woo, M., Neider, J., Davis, T., (2007) OpenGL (R) Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL (R), Version 2.1., , Addison-Wesley Professional; Chandler, H.M., (2012) Manual de Produção de Jogos Digitais, , Bookman; Brown, C., (2014) Advances in Computer Vision, , Psychology Press; Cristinacce, D., Cootes, T.F., Feature Detection and Tracking with Constrained Local Models (2006) BMVC, 1 (2), p. 3; Possa, P.R., Mahmoudi, S.A., Harb, N., Valderrama, C., Manneback, P., A multi-resolution fpga-based architecture for real-time edge and corner detection (2014) Computers, IEEE Transactions, pp. 2376-2388; Teng, S.W., Sadat, R.M.N., Lu, G., Effective and efficient contour-based corner detectors (2015) Pattern Recognition, 48 (7), pp. 2185-2197; Jena, K.K., Mishra, S., Mishra, S.N., Edge Detection of Satellite Images: A Comparative Study (2015) IJISET, 2 (3), p. 2015; Koenderink, J.J., The structure of images (1984) Biological Cybernetics, 50 (5), pp. 363-370; Ikeuchi, K., (2014) Computer Vision: A Reference Guide, pp. 701-713. , Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated; Collins, R., Mean-shift blob tracking through scale space (2003) Proc. 2003 IEEE Computer Society Conference.

Therefore, miRNAs are involved in several biological processes, making the study of these molecules one of the most relevant topics of molecular biology nowadays. However, characterizing miRNAs in vivo is still a complex task. As a consequence, in silico methods have been developed to predict miRNA loci. A common ab initio strategy to find miRNAs in genomic data is to search for sequences that can fold into the typical hairpin structure of miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The current ab initio approaches, however, have selectivity issues, i.e., a high number of false positives is reported, which can lead to laborious and costly attempts to provide biological validation. This study presents an extension of the ab initio method miRNAFold, with the aim of improving selectivity through machine learning techniques, namely, random forest combined with the SMOTE procedure that copes with imbalance datasets. Results: By comparing our method, termed Mirnacle, with other important approaches in the literature, we demonstrate that Mirnacle substantially improves selectivity without compromising sensitivity. For the three datasets used in our experiments, our method achieved at least 97% of sensitivity and could deliver a two-fold, 20-fold, and 6-fold increase in selectivity, respectively, compared with the best results of current computational tools. Conclusions: The extension of miRNAFold by the introduction of machine learning techniques, significantly increases selectivity in pre-miRNA ab initio prediction, which optimally contributes to advanced studies on miRNAs, as the need of biological validations is diminished. Hopefully, new research, such as studies of severe diseases caused by miRNA malfunction, will benefit from the proposed computational tool. © 2016 The Author(s).","Data mining; Machine learning; MicroRNA; Pre-miRNA ab initio prediction; Random forest; Smote","Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Gene expression; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Ab initio prediction; Biological validations; Computational tools; Hairpin structures; Machine learning techniques; MicroRNAs; Random forests; Smote; RNA; microRNA; animal; biology; chemistry; computer simulation; conformation; devices; eukaryote; evaluation study; genetics; genome; genomics; human; machine learning; plant; procedures; Animals; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Eukaryota; Genome; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; MicroRNAs; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Plants",,"MicroRNAs",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

However, the range of available NGS platforms requires different strategies and software to correctly assemble genomes. Different strategies are necessary to properly complete an assembly project, in addition to the installation or modification of various software. This requires users to have significant expertise in these software and command line scripting experience on Unix platforms, besides possessing the basic expertise on methodologies and techniques for genome assembly. These difficulties often delay the complete genome assembly projects. Results: In order to overcome this, we developed SIMBA (SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies), a freely available web tool that integrates several component tools for assembling and finishing bacterial genomes. SIMBA provides a friendly and intuitive user interface so bioinformaticians, even with low computational expertise, can work under a centralized administrative control system of assemblies managed by the assembly center head. SIMBA guides the users to execute assembly process through simple and interactive pages. SIMBA workflow was divided in three modules: (i) projects: allows a general vision of genome sequencing projects, in addition to data quality analysis and data format conversions; (ii) assemblies: allows de novo assemblies with the software Mira, Minia, Newbler and SPAdes, also assembly quality validations using QUAST software; and (iii) curation: presents methods to finishing assemblies through tools for scaffolding contigs and close gaps. We also presented a case study that validated the efficacy of SIMBA to manage bacterial assemblies projects sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM. Conclusion: Besides to be a web tool for genome assembly, SIMBA is a complete genome assemblies project management system, which can be useful for managing of several projects in laboratories. SIMBA source code is available to download and install in local webservers at http://ufmg-simba.sourceforge.net. © 2016 The Author(s).","Bacterial genome; Bioinformatics; Genome assembly; Genome finishing; Ion Torrent PGM; Web tool","Bioinformatics; DNA sequences; Ions; Project management; Quality control; Scaffolds; User interfaces; Administrative controls; Bacterial genomes; Genome assembly; Genome sequencing projects; Intuitive user interface; Next-generation sequencing; Project management system; Web tools; Genes; bacterial genome; bacterium; biology; chromosomal mapping; classification; data mining; devices; DNA sequence; evaluation study; genetics; high throughput sequencing; Internet; isolation and purification; nucleotide sequence; procedures; software; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Genome, Bacterial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Internet; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software",,,,,,,,"Loman, N.J., Constantinidou, C., Chan, J.Z., Halachev, M., Sergeant, M., Penn, C.W., High-throughput bacterial genome sequencing: an embarrassment of choice, a world of opportunity (2012) Nat Rev Microbiol, 10, pp. 599-606; Miller, J.R., Koren, S., Sutton, G., Assembly algorithms for next-generation sequencing data (2010) Genomics, 95, pp. 315-327; Nagarajan, N., Pop, M., Sequence assembly demystified (2013) Nat Rev Genet, 14, pp. 157-167; Ribeiro, F.J., Przybylski, D., Yin, S., Sharpe, T., Gnerre, S., Abouelleil, A., Finished bacterial genomes from shotgun sequence data (2012) Genome Res, 22, pp. 2270-2277; Galardini, M., Biondi, E.G., Bazzicalupo, M., Mengoni, A., CONTIGuator: a bacterial genomes finishing tool for structural insights on draft genomes (2011) Source Code Biol Med, 6, p. 11; Darling, A.C., Mau, B., Blattner, F.R., Perna, N.T., Mauve: multiple alignment of conserved genomic sequence with rearrangements (2004) Genome Res, 14, pp. 1394-1403; Mariano, D.C., Pereira, F.L., Ghosh, P., Barh, D., Figueiredo, H.C., Silva, A., MapRepeat: an approach for effective assembly of repetitive regions in prokaryotic genomes (2015) Bioinformation, 11, p. 276; Onmus-Leone, F., Hang, J., Clifford, R.J., Yang, Y., Riley, M.C., Kuschner, R.A., Enhanced De Novo Assembly of High Throughput Pyrosequencing Data Using Whole Genome Mapping (2013), 8. , Xiao J, editor.

MS/MS yields thousands of spectra in a single run which are then interpreted by software. Most of these computer programs use a protein database to match peptide sequences to the observed spectra. The peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) must also be assessed by computational tools since manual evaluation is not practicable. The target-decoy database strategy is largely used for error estimation in PSM assessment. However, in general, that strategy does not account for sensitivity. Results: In a previous study, we proposed the method MUMAL that applies an artificial neural network to effectively generate a model to classify PSMs using decoy hits with increased sensitivity. Nevertheless, the present approach shows that the sensitivity can be further improved with the use of a cost matrix associated with the learning algorithm. We also demonstrate that using a threshold selector algorithm for probability adjustment leads to more coherent probability values assigned to the PSMs. Our new approach, termed MUMAL2, provides a two-fold contribution to shotgun proteomics. First, the increase in the number of correctly interpreted spectra in the peptide level augments the chance of identifying more proteins. Second, the more appropriate PSM probability values that are produced by the threshold selector algorithm impact the protein inference stage performed by programs that take probabilities into account, such as ProteinProphet. Our experiments demonstrate that MUMAL2 reached around 15% of improvement in sensitivity compared to the best current method. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve obtained was 0.93, demonstrating that the probabilities generated by our model are in fact appropriate. Finally, Venn diagrams comparing MUMAL2 with the best current method show that the number of exclusive peptides found by our method was nearly 4-fold higher, which directly impacts the proteome coverage. Conclusions: The inclusion of a cost matrix and a probability threshold selector algorithm to the learning task further improves the target-decoy database analysis for identifying peptides, which optimally contributes to the challenging task of protein level identification, resulting in a powerful computational tool for shotgun proteomics. © 2016 The Author(s).","Artificial neural network;

Generally, this process is carried out in isolated spots and thereforemay be ineffective in mitigating. This chapter describes an architecture of a multi-agent system forenvironmental risk assessment in areas contaminated as often occur in mining, oil exploration, intensiveagriculture and others. Plan multiple points in space-time matrix where each agent carries out exposureassessment and the exchange of information on toxicity, to characterize and classify risk in real time.Therefore, it is an architecture model with multi-agent that integrates ontology by semantic representation,classifies risks by decision rules by support vectors machines with multidimensional data. The resultis an environment to exchange information that provides knowledge about the chemical contamination,which can assist in the planning and management of mitigation of the affected area. © 2017 by IGI Global.

Two test sites were selected in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina State. We used scenes from the airborne system for acquisition and post-processing of images (SAAPI) with a spatial resolution of 0.39m. The dataset consists of orthorectified images containing three spectral bands in the visible range (i.e. 0.38-0.70pm), three spectral bands in the near infrared (i.e. 0.76- 0.78pm) and a digital surface model. The methodologies were developed using feature selection and decision tree algorithms in the following open source softwares: InterlMAGE, WEKA and QGIS. The results were satisfactory to classify successional stages of FOM as well as other classes of land use and land corer. The obtained Kappa indices ranged from 0.53 to 0.59 and the conditional Kappa varied from 0.29 to 0.83 for the successional forest stages. These results demonstrate the potential of these approaches for the extraction of information in high spatial resolution imagery as well as the possibility of providing subsidies for the implementation of public policies and monitoring of forest resources.","Aerophotogrammetric Surrey; Decision tree; Secondary forests","Computer software; Decision trees; Forestry; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Land use; Open source software; Open systems; Aerophotogrammetric Surrey; Decision-tree algorithm; Digital surface models; Extraction of information; Forest environments; High spatial resolution imagery; Secondary forests; Successional stages; Land use and land cover; Mountainous regions; Data mining; Data; Environments; Forests; Computer Programs; Data Processing; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,"Achanccaray Diaz, P.M., (2014) A Comparison of Segmentation Algorithms for Remote Sensing, p. 84. , Dissertagao (Mestrado em Engenharia Eletrica)- Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro.

Ex R. E. Fries) is an oilseed with the potential for cultivation in Brazil as a source of renewable energy in areas with tropical conditions. Crambe oil contains erucic acid, giving it economic importance for use in the electricity sector. Crambe oil can be used in insulating fluids and in the manufacture of chemical products and biodiesel without competing with human food production. As it is a new crop in Brazil, the scientific literature on crambe is still scarce. This review discusses general aspects of agricultural production and the potential applications of crambe associated mainly with the manufacture of biodiesel. The topics discussed in this review include: (i) genetic improvement of crambe; (ii) agronomic practices of production, pests, diseases, harvesting, storage, and economic viability; (iii) industrial use of crambe oil as an electrical insulator and in biodiesel; (iv) detoxification of the co-product generated during oil extraction for use in animal feed and use of the co-product in the natural bioremediation of contaminants; and (v) the challenges of increasing crambe production. Crambe has a remarkable future as a source of renewable energy in Brazil. Strategies to boost its cultivation, such as the identification of improved varieties and optimization of production system logistics, marketing, and resource allocation, should be adopted. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Brassicaceae; Crambe abyssinica; Energy crops; Renewable energy","Agriculture; Biodiesel; Bioremediation; Crops; Cultivation; Data mining; Detoxification; Economics; Fatty acids; Fuel storage; Oils and fats; Oilseeds; Agricultural productions; Brassicaceae; Crambe abyssinica; Electrical insulators; Energy crops; Genetic improvements; Renewable energies; Scientific literature; Manufacture",,,,,,,,"MME – Ministerio de Minas e Energia.

In Brazil, the usual method for estimating the consumption of electrical materials relies on constant rates per electrical points, incurring in large estimation errors. Furthermore, these rates can only be used in advanced project phases. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the consumption of electrical materials, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), by using information from early project stages. A dataset with project attributes was used to construct the ANN estimation models. In order to evaluate these new models, their estimates were compared to results from linear regression and constant rate models. Results showed that the ANN models have better performance when compared to other methods, supporting that ANNs are well suited for nonlinear and multidimensional problems. This investigation, therefore, supports that the method proposed could also be used by construction companies for estimating the consumption of other materials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Building material consumption; Data mining; Electrical systems; Estimation; Feature selection; Information extraction; Intelligent systems","Complex networks; Construction industry; Estimation; Feature extraction; Information retrieval; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Construction companies; Electrical materials; Electrical systems; Estimation models; Large estimation errors; Material consumption; Multidimensional problems; Residential building; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Hong, T., Hyun, C., Moon, H., Cbr-based cost prediction model-II of the design phase for multi-family housing projects (2011) Expert Syst.

There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods’ codes and datasets used in this article, deploying them in a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods. © 2016, Ribeiro et al.","benchmark;

This analysis is performed by grouping together objects of the data that are more similar among themselves than to objects of different groups. The sampled data may be described by numerical features or by a symbolic representation, known as categorical features. These features often require a transformation into numerical data in order to be properly handled by clustering algorithms. The transformation usually assigns a weight for each feature calculated by a measure of importance (i.e., frequency, mutual information). A problem with the weight assignment is that the values are calculated with respect to the whole set of objects and features. This may pose as a problem when a subset of the features have a higher degree of importance to a subset of objects but a lower degree with another subset. One way to deal with such problem is to measure the importance of each subset of features only with respect to a subset of objects. This is known as co-clustering that, similarly to clustering, is the task of finding a subset of objects and features that presents a higher similarity among themselves than to other subsets of objects and features. As one might notice, this task has a higher complexity than the traditional clustering and, if not properly dealt with, may present an scalability issue. In this paper we propose a novel co-clustering technique, called HBLCoClust, with the objective of extracting a set of co-clusters from a categorical data set, without the guarantees of an enumerative algorithm, but with the compromise of scalability. This is done by using a probabilistic clustering algorithm, named Locality Sensitive Hashing, together with the enumerative algorithm named InClose. The experimental results are competitive when applied to labeled categorical data sets and text corpora. Additionally, it is shown that the extracted co-clusters can be of practical use to expert systems such as Recommender Systems and Topic Extraction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biclustering; Categorical data; Co-clustering; Data mining; Text mining","Algorithms; Cluster analysis; Cobalt compounds; Data mining; Expert systems; Metadata; Scalability; Set theory; Bi-clustering; Categorical data; Co-clustering; Locality sensitive hashing; Probabilistic clustering; Structural organization; Symbolic representation; Text mining; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,,"Anandkumar, A., Valluvan, R., Learning loopy graphical models with latent variables: Efficient methods and guarantees (2013) The Annals of Statistics, 41 (2), pp. 401-435; Andrews, S., In-close, a fast algorithm for computing formal concepts (2009) International conference on conceptual structures; Andrews, S., In-close2, a high performance formal concept miner (2011) Conceptual structures for discovering knowledge, pp. 50-62. , Springer; Bache, K., Lichman, M., UCI machine learning repository (2013), http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml, URL; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2001) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 601-608; Boriah, S., Chandola, V., Kumar, V., Similarity measures for categorical data: A comparative evaluation (2008) Red, 30 (2), p. 3; Broder, A.Z., On the resemblance and containment of documents (1997) Compression and complexity of sequences 1997. proceedings, pp. 21-29. , IEEE; Carter, J., Wegman, M.N., Universal classes of hash functions (1979) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 18 (2), pp. 143-154; de Castro, P.A.D., de França, F.O., Ferreira, H.M., Coelho, G.P., Von Zuben, F.J., Query expansion using an immune-inspired biclustering algorithm (2010) Natural Computing, pp. 1-24; Cheng, Y., Church, G.M., Biclustering of expression data (2000) Proceedings of the 8th international conference on intelligent systems for molecular biology, pp. 93-103; Coelho, G.P., de França, F.O., Von Zuben, F.J., Multi-objective biclustering: When non-dominated solutions are not enough (2009) Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms; de Castro, P.A.D., de França, F.O., Ferreira, H.M., Von Zuben, F.J., Applying Biclustering to Perform Collaborative Filtering (2007) Proceedings of the 7th international conference on intelligent systems design and applications, pp. 421-426. , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Dhillon, I.S., Mallela, S., Modha, D.S., Information-theoretic co-clustering (2003) Proceedings of the ninth acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 89-98. , ACM; Feng, H.-M., Chen, C.-Y., Ye, F., Evolutionary fuzzy particle swarm optimization vector quantization learning scheme in image compression (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32 (1), pp. 213-222; de França, F.O., Coelho, G.P., Von Zuben, F.J., bicaco: An ant colony inspired biclustering algorithm (2008) Ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, pp. 401-402. , Springer; de França, F.O., Coelho, G.P., Von Zuben, F.J., Predicting missing values with biclustering: A coherence-based approach (2013) Pattern Recognition, 46 (5), pp. 1255-1266; de França, F.O., Scalable overlapping co-clustering of word-document data (2012) Machine learning and applications (icmla), 2012 11th international conference on, 1, pp. 464-467. , IEEE; de França, F.O., Von Zuben, F.J., Finding a high coverage set of 5-biclusters with swarm intelligence (2010) Evolutionary computation (cec), 2010 ieee congress on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; de França, F.O., Von Zuben, F.J., Extracting additive and multiplicative coherent biclusters with swarm intelligence (2011) Evolutionary computation (cec), 2011 ieee congress on, pp. 632-638. , IEEE; Funk, S., Netflix update: Try this at home (2006); Gao, T., Akoglu, L., Fast information-theoretic agglomerative co-clustering (2014) Databases theory and applications, Lecture notes in computer science, 8506, pp. 147-159. , H.

In this context, it is important to have a combined view of the chemical and biological changes in the mining dump area. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the Pb, Zn and Cd contamination in a slag disposal area using the integration of geochemical and microbiological data. Analyses of soil organic matter (SOM), pH, Eh, pseudo-total concentration of metals, sequential extraction and microbial community by polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) were conducted. Metal availability was evaluated based on the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), ecological risk (Eri), Risk Assessment Code (RAC) and experimental data, and different reference values were tested to assist in the interpretation of the indices. The soil pH was slightly acidic to neutral, the Eh values indicated oxidized conditions and the average SOM content varied from 12.10 to 53.60 g kg−1. The average pseudo-total concentrations of metals were in the order of Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cd. Pb and Zn were mainly bound to the residual fraction and Fe–Mn oxides, and a significant proportion of Cd was bound to the exchangeable and carbonate fractions. The topsoil (0–20 cm) is highly contaminated (Igeo) with Cd and has a very high potential ecological risk (Eri). Higher bacterial diversity was mainly associated with higher metal concentrations. It is concluded that the integration of geochemical and microbiological data can provide an appropriate evaluation of mining waste-contaminated areas. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Geoaccumulation index; Microbial diversity; Mining area; PCR–DGGE; Potential ecological risk; Sequential extraction","Cadmium; Contamination; Data integration; Ecology; Electrophoresis; Extraction; Geochemistry; Integration; Lead; Manganese; Metals; Polymerase chain reaction; Positive ions; Risk assessment; Slags; Soils; Waste disposal; Zinc; Geo-accumulation index; Microbial diversity; Mining areas; Potential ecological risk; Sequential extraction; Soil pollution; cadmium; iron oxide; lead; manganese oxide; soil organic matter; zinc; heavy metal; lead; soil; soil pollutant; zinc; environmental risk; geoaccumulation index; geochemistry; heavy metal; microbial community; microbiology; mine waste; polymerase chain reaction; sequential extraction; slag; soil pollution; waste disposal; Article; chemical parameters; concentration (parameters); data analysis; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; ecological risk; environmental parameters; extraction; geoaccumulation index; geochemistry; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiology; oxidation reduction potential; polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; Risk Assessment Code; sequential extraction; slag disposal area; soil; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil pollution; topsoil; waste disposal; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; mining; pollution; procedures; soil pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Zinc",,"cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; iron oxide, 1332-37-2; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; manganese oxide, 11129-60-5, 1317-35-7; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Zinc",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Recent discussions between academia, environmental protection agencies, and industry partners, have highlighted problems with the current Brazilian legislation for the protection of caves. While the licensing process is long, complex and cumbersome, the criteria used to assign caves into conservation relevance categories are often subjective, with relevance being mainly determined by the presence of obligate cave dwellers (troglobites) and their presumed rarity. However, the rarity of these troglobitic species is questionable, as most remain unidentified to the species level and their habitats and distribution ranges are poorly known. Using data from 844 iron caves retrieved from different speleology reports for the Carajás region (South-Eastern Amazon, Brazil), one of the world's largest deposits of high-grade iron ore, we assess the influence of different cave characteristics on four biodiversity proxies (species richness, presence of troglobites, presence of rare troglobites, and presence of resident bat populations). We then examine how the current relevance classification scheme ranks caves with different biodiversity indicators. Large caves were found to be important reservoirs of biodiversity, so they should be prioritized in conservation programs. Our results also reveal spatial autocorrelation in all the biodiversity proxies assessed, indicating that iron caves should be treated as components of a cave network immersed in the karst landscape. Finally, we show that by prioritizing the conservation of rare troglobites, the current relevance classification scheme is undermining overall cave biodiversity and leaving ecologically important caves unprotected. We argue that conservation efforts should target subterranean habitats as a whole and propose an alternative relevance ranking scheme, which could help simplify the assessment process and channel more resources to the effective protection of overall cave biodiversity. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The Internet and the Web have made it possible for people to share their opinions and for other people and organizations find out more about opinions and experiences from individuals. Still, opinions involve sentiments that are vague and imprecise textual descriptions. Hence, due to the nature of the data, Fuzzy Logic can be a promising approach. This paper proposes a method to automatically build a fuzzy system, based on features extracted and selected from documents, to perform classification of sentiment in opinions across different domains. Almost 60 features were extracted from documents and multiple feature selection algorithms were applied. Over the selected features, the Wang-Mendel (WM) method was used to generate fuzzy rules and classify documents. Variations on fuzzy set modeling, on the use of weights in the rules and on fuzzy inference mechanisms were considered. The classifier fuzzy system based achieved 71,25% of accuracy in a 10-fold cross-validation, comparable to a SVM classifier. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","feature extraction and selection; fuzzy rule-based systems; Opinion mining; sentiment classification","Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Information retrieval systems; Sentiment analysis; 10-fold cross-validation; Different domains; Feature extraction and selection; Fuzzy inference mechanism; Fuzzy-set model; Multiple features; Sentiment classification; Textual description; Fuzzy inference",,,,,,,,"Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5 (1), pp. 1-167; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Found.

However, the true public health impact of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), a common genetic disorder associated with premature cardiovascular disease, is yet to be reliably ascertained using similar approaches. The European Atherosclerosis Society FH Studies Collaboration (EAS FHSC) is a new initiative of international stakeholders which will help establish a global FH registry to generate large-scale, robust data on the burden of FH worldwide. Methods The EAS FHSC will maximise the potential exploitation of currently available and future FH data (retrospective and prospective) by bringing together regional/national/international data sources with access to individuals with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of heterozygous or homozygous FH. A novel bespoke electronic platform and FH Data Warehouse will be developed to allow secure data sharing, validation, cleaning, pooling, harmonisation and analysis irrespective of the source or format. Standard statistical procedures will allow us to investigate cross-sectional associations, patterns of real-world practice, trends over time, and analyse risk and outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause death), accounting for potential confounders and subgroup effects. Conclusions The EAS FHSC represents an excellent opportunity to integrate individual efforts across the world to tackle the global burden of FH. The information garnered from the registry will help reduce gaps in knowledge, inform best practices, assist in clinical trials design, support clinical guidelines and policies development, and ultimately improve the care of FH patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Cardiovascular disease; Familial hypercholesterolaemia; Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Studies Collaboration; LDL-Cholesterol; Registry; Study design","Article; computer security; data base; familial hypercholesterolemia; human; information dissemination; information processing; interpersonal communication; medical ethics; medical information; medical society; methodology; patient care; priority journal; access to information; clinical trial; cooperation; data mining; genetics; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; information retrieval; integrated health care system; international cooperation; methodology; mortality; multicenter study; organization; organization and management; practice gap; register; treatment outcome; Access to Information; Cooperative Behavior; Data Mining; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Information Storage and Retrieval; International Cooperation; Organizational Objectives; Professional Practice Gaps; Registries; Research Design; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,,"Nordestgaard, B.G., Chapman, M.J., Humphries, S.E., Ginsberg, H.N., Masana, L., Descamps, O.S., Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society (2013) Eur Heart J, 34, pp. 3478-3490a; Cuchel, M., Bruckert, E., Ginsberg, H.N., Raal, F.J., Santos, R.D., Hegele, R.A., Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new insights and guidance for clinicians to improve detection and clinical management.

Such systems rely on feature extraction to provide meaningful information and representation of shapes and images. However, accurate feature extraction is not a trivial task since it may depend on parameter adjustment, application domain and the shape data set itself. Indeed, there is a demand for computational tools to understand and support parameter adjustment and therefore unfold shape description representation, since manual parameter choices may not be suitable for real applications. Our major contribution is the definition of an evolutionary optimization methodology that fully supports parameter adjustment of a multiscale shape descriptor for feature extraction and representation of leaf shapes in a high dimensional space. Here, intelligent evolutionary optimization methods search for parameters that best fit the normalized multiscale bending energy descriptor for leaf shape retrieval and classification. The simulated annealing, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization methods optimize an objective function, which is based on the silhouette measure, to achieve the set of optimal parameters. Our methodology improves leaf shape characterization and recognition due to the intrinsic shape differences which are embedded in the set of optimized parameters. Experiments were conducted on public benchmark data sets with the normalized multiscale bending energy and inner-distance shape context descriptors. The visual exploratory data analysis techniques showed that the proposed methodology minimized the total within-cluster variance and thus, improved the leaf shape clustering. Moreover, supervised and unsupervised classification experiments with plant leaves accomplished high Precision and Recall rates as well as Bulls-eye scores with the optimized parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data visualization; Evolutionary optimization; Image processing; Leaf taxonomy; Shape analysis","Computer vision; Data mining; Data visualization; Evolutionary algorithms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Object recognition; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plants (botany); Simulated annealing; Differential evolution and particle swarm optimizations; Evolutionary optimization method; Evolutionary optimizations; Exploratory data analysis; High dimensional spaces; Inner-distance shape contexts; Shape analysis; Supervised and unsupervised classification; Shape optimization",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 401442/2014-4, 444784/2014-4

Pattern discovery in data produced by Learning Management Systems (LMS) elicits important information about the educational process, especially when considering correlations between stakeholders interacting in different perspectives of the LMS like grades, access, forum or message communications. In this paper, we propose a data and metadata model for Learning Analytics applications using data from LMS. This model is LMS independent and supports Business Intelligence and Data Mining applications for decision-making in the educational context. Our model considers the use of historical data from LMS treated under three perspectives that can be analyzed individually or correlated. The model also allows analysis considering different stakeholders (student, educator, etc.) and levels of granularity (institution, department, course, discipline, etc.). In this sense, the proposed model allows consistent and correlated analysis of data from LMSs. As a result, our model effective collaborates with the educational process through an efficient decision-making. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Decision making; Education; Education computing; Information analysis;

With this in mind, we conducted a systematic review of published articles in six repositories to extract studies for subsequent analysis using text mining and graph analysis software. © 2016 IEEE.","Authorship; Systematic review; Virtual world","Data mining; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Interactive computer graphics; Virtual reality; Authorship; Educational context; Graph analysis; Systematic Review; Text mining; Three-dimensional virtual world; Virtual worlds; Engineering education",,,,,,,,"Amaral, E., Avila, B.G., Tarouco, L.M.R., Aspectos teóricos e práticos da implantação de um laboratório virtual no OpenSim (2012) XXIII Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática Na Educação, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Andreas, K., Tsiatsos, T., Terzidou, T., Pomportsis, A., Fostering collaborative learning in second life: Metaphors and affordances (2010) Revista Computers & Education, 55, pp. 603-615; Ariyadewa, P.D., Wathsala, W.V., Pradeepan, V., Perera, R.P.D.D.T., Atukorale, D.A.S., Virtual learning model for metaverses (2010) 11th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer), , Colombo, Sri Lanka; Ávila, B., Tarouco, L., Passerino, L., Guterer, P., Autoria nos Mundos Virtuais: um novo desafio ao docente (2014) Revista NOvas Tecnologias Na Educação (RENOTE), 12 (2); Berns, A., Pardo, A.G., Camacho, D.C., Game-like language learning in 3-D virtual environments (2013) Revista Computers & Education, 60, pp. 210-220. , Ed 1; Bulu, S.T., Place presence, social presence, copresence, and satisfaction in virtual worlds (2012) Revista Computers & Education, 58, pp. 154-161; Carpeño, A., López, S., Arriaga, J., Using remote laboratory elab3d for a broader practical skills training in electronics (2014) 11th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation (REV), , Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP) in Porto, Portugal; Chaves, R.S., (2013) Agrupamento de Documentos Eletrônicos Por Meio de Sintagmas NOminais, , Projeto de dissertação de Mestrado em Sistemas de Informação e Gestão do Conhecimento.

This is due, in part, to the enormous size, multinational composition and interconnected nature of the Amazon River system, as well as to the absence of an adequate spatial model for integrating data across the entire Amazon Basin. In this data article we present a spatially uniform multi-scale GIS framework that was developed especially for the analysis, management and monitoring of various aspects of aquatic systems in the Amazon Basin.

Therefore, the authors propose an Institutional Teaching Evaluation model that applies, among others, the Sentiment Analysis to identify which teaching practices are positive or negative from the perspective of students from a Higher Education Institution. Differently than the current Institutional Teaching Evaluation models, which are founded on the evaluators' assumptions, this model responds to the need of better pedagogical practices through data mining, finding new categories of analysis in the discourse of a group of students to contribute to the conception of a more effective Teaching Evaluation and to create awareness about teaching practices. © 2016 IEEE.","Educational Data Mining; Institutional Teaching Evaluation; Sentiment Analysis","Data mining; Education computing; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Educational data mining; Effective teaching; Evaluation modeling; Higher education institutions; Pedagogical practices; Sentiment analysis; Teaching evaluation; Teaching practices; Education",,,,,,,,"Grohmann, M.Z., Ramos, M.S., Competências docentes como antecedentes da Avaliaçõ De Desempenho do Professor: Percepçõ de mestrandos de administraçõ (2012) Avaliaçõ Rev. da Avaliaçõ da Educ.

However, there are various existing sentiment analysis methods and it is unclear which of them are deployable in the mobile environment. This paper provides the first of a kind study in which we compare the performance of 17 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods in the mobile environment. To do that, we adapted these sentence-level methods to run on Android OS and then we measure their performance in terms of memory usage, CPU usage, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil sentence-level methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory. We hope our effort provides a guide to developers and researchers interested in exploring sentiment analysis as part of a mobile application and can help new applications to be executed without the dependency of a server-side API. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Application programming interfaces (API); Mobile devices; Battery consumption; Mobile applications; Mobile environments; New applications; Sentence level; Sentiment analysis; Server sides; Social media platforms; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Damage caused by the spread of rumours is difficult to handle without a full understanding of the dynamics behind it. One of the central steps of understanding rumour spread is to analyze who spread rumours online, why, and how. In this research, we focus on the steps who and why by describing, implementing, and evaluating an approach that studies whether or not a group of users is actively involved in rumour discussions, and assesses rumour-spreading personality types in OSNs. We implement this general approach using Reddit data, and demonstrate its use by determining which users engage with a recurring rumour, and analyzing their comments using qualitative methods. We find that we can reliably classify users into one of three categories: (1) 'Generally support a false rumour', (2) 'Generally refute a false rumour', or (3) 'Generally joke about a false rumour'. Combining text mining techniques, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis, we aim to identify and classify those rumour-spreading user categories automatically and provide a more holistic view of rumour spread in OSNs. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Holistic view; Online social networks (OSNs); Personality types; Qualitative method; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Text mining techniques; Three categories; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Nevertheless, even considering the efforts to reduce the number of women deaths due to problems related to pregnancy, this decrease presented less impact than other areas of human development. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, account for significant proportion of perinatal morbidity and maternal mortality. In this context, this paper proposes an inference model that uses data mining (DM) techniques capable for operating in a data set to extract patterns and assist in knowledge discovery. Identifying hypertensive crises that complicate pregnancy, it can impact in a meaningful reduction the incidence of sequelae and death of pregnant women. Comparison between two Bayesian classifiers is performed in this work to better classify the hypertensive disorders severity. Results showed that Naïve Bayes classifier had an excellent performance, presenting better precision and F-measure, compared to the other experimented classifiers. Even finding a good performance to predict hypertensive disorders, other Bayesian methods need to be evaluated, as well as other DM techniques such as those based on artificial intelligence (AI) and tree-based methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayes Methods; Data Mining; Decision Support Systems; eHealth; Hypertension; Pregnancy","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Decision support systems; Obstetrics; Bayes method; Bayesian classifier; Decision support system (DSSs); Ehealth; Hypertension; Inference mechanism; Maternal mortality; Pregnancy; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 207706/2014-0

A dissimilar lap joint was set using DP 600 dual phase steel with AISI 304 stainless steel. The experiments were performed on a medium-frequency direct current spot welding machine with proper data acquisition of voltage and welding current. Temperature evolution was also acquired by using IR camera. The mechanical properties of spot welds were evaluated by using a coach peel testing. The effect of welding current and welding time on mechanical properties was also evaluated. Correlations between polarity with the welding nugget size, failure mode, tensile strength, temperature evolution and dynamic resistance were analysed. The analysis confirmed that the polarity on dissimilar lap joints affects the behaviour of dissimilar RSWs. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","Dissimilar; DP 600; Failure mode; High strength steel; Mechanical testing; Polarity; Resistance spot welding","Data acquisition; Electric welding; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; High strength steel; Joints (structural components); Mechanical properties; Mechanical testing; Resistance welding; Spot welding; Steel testing; Tensile strength; Welding; Welds; AISI-304 stainless steel; Dissimilar; DP 600; Dynamic resistance; Polarity; Resistance spot weld; Resistance spot welding; Temperature evolution; Stainless steel",,,,,,,,"Eshraghi, M., Tschopp, M.A., Zaeem, M.A., Felicelli, S.D., Effect of resistance spot welding parameters on weld pool properties in a DP600 dual-phase steel: a parametric study using thermomechanically-coupled finite element analysis (2014) Mater.

Recent studies using non-symbolic learning algorithms have reported significant results in terms of classification accuracy. However, in applications related to decision-making processes it is necessary to understand of reasoning used in the classification process. To take this into account, the shapelet primitive has been proposed in the literature as a descriptor of local morphological characteristics. On the other hand, most of the existing work related to shapelets has been dedicated to the development of more effective approaches in terms of time and accuracy, disregarding the need for the classifiers interpretation. In this work, we propose the construction of symbolic models for time series classification using shapelet transformation. Moreover, we develop strategies to improve the representation quality of the shapelet transformation, using feature selection algorithms. We performed experimental evaluations comparing our proposal with the state-of-the-art algorithms present in the time series classification literature. Based upon the experimental results, we argue that the improvement in shapelet representation can contribute to the construction of more interpretable and competitive classifiers in comparison to non-symbolic methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data mining; Shapelets; Time series","Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision trees; Time series; Classification accuracy; Decision making process; Experimental evaluation; Feature selection algorithm; Morphological characteristic; Shapelets; State-of-the-art algorithms; Time series classifications; Data mining",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES","We would like to thank Dr. Jason Lines for providing the original source code of shapelet transformation algorithm and Dr. Eamonn Keogh for providing the datasets used in the experimental evaluation.

Even though we rely on learning algorithms to pinpoint the optimal decision boundaries in the feature space by properly detecting latent relationships among the input features, their performance is often bounded by the discriminative power of the available features. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing preprocessing methods that are capable of transforming the input data with the final goal of aiding the machine learning algorithm in building high-quality classification models. One such a method is feature construction, which is a flexible preprocessing procedure that exploits linear and nonlinear transformations of the original feature space in an attempt to capture useful information that is not explicit in the original data. Since the task of feature construction can be modelled as a heuristic search in the space of novel latent features, this paper investigates an evolutionary approach for performing such a task, namely grammatical evolution (GE). In our proposed approach, GE is employed for building an extra novel feature from the available input data in order to maximize the predictive performance of the learning algorithm in training data. Results show that many interesting implicit relationships are indeed found by the evolutionary approach, improving the performance of two well-known decision-tree induction algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational grammars; Data mining; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Input output programs; Learning systems; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Neonatal monitoring; Decision tree induction; Evolutionary approach; Grammatical evolution; Implicit relationships; Non-linear transformations; Optimal decision boundary; Pre-processing method; Predictive performance; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,"Michalski, R.S., (1978) Pattern Recognition As Knowledge-guided Computer Induction, , Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; De Melo, V.V., Banzhaf, W., Kaizen programming for feature generation (2015) Genetic Programming Theory and Practice XIII, Ser.

The patterns can reveal tendencies, similarities and predictions, but the information is usually implicit and difficult to be validated. Classification is one of the most relevant research areas in text mining, and it usually consists of predicting the class of a textual document based on a set of documents previously organized into different classes, such as author or topic. Choosing the words to compose the feature set is crucial to a proper classification. A well selected feature set can improve the performance of the classification method and enlighten the interpretation of the classification model adjusted to the data. This paper introduces the Feature Cluster Filter (FCFilter) method for feature selection. FCFilter eliminates the need to input or optimize the number of clusters by grouping the words in a sufficiently high number of clusters. Genetic algorithms are applied to optimize the combination of groups that will provide the final feature set. The method is based on the selection of features that are good predictors for text classification by clustering features and selecting only the suitable clusters. Experiments performed to evaluate the FCFilter with the Reuters-21578, SCY-Genes and SCY-Clusters datasets showed a significant reduction in the feature-value table dimensionality with slight improvements in the classification accuracy when compared to the baselines. The results are very promising, indicating potential improvements in the research on feature selection for text mining. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Filtration; Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval systems; Text processing; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Classification models; Clustering feature; Different class; Number of clusters; Text classification; Textual documents; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Manning, C.D., Schutze, H.S., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT Press; Mitchell, T., (1997) Machine Learning, Ser.

Due to interaction between projects even a seemingly cheap and effective project may not be the most appropriate choice as, in the complete portfolio, it may interact badly with other projects. The objective of this paper is to produce an algorithm capable of finding an adequate solution to this kind of problem in a viable time frame. The proposed heuristic modifies an initial solution through a series of permutation operations with the objective of finding a better solution. Using data and projects from a real Brazilian mine, the algorithm is compared with the current adopted solutions. The algorithm is also used to solve problems of similar classes and its complexity order is estimated. For a collection of 15 projects applied to a medium port mining station, the algorithm is able to find the optimal solution with 93 evaluations of the objective function (in a 3-hour time frame) for the studied instance of the problem. The algorithm also indicates a linear complexity regarding to the number of projects. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Evolutionary algorithms; Investments; Problem solving; Solution mining; Complexity orders; Initial solution; Linear complexity; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Permutation operations; Portfolio selection; Time frame; Open pit mining",,,,,,,,"Aisopos, F., Tserpes, K., Varvarigou, T., Resource management in software as a service using the knapsack problem model (2013) International Journal of Production Economics, 141 (2), pp. 465-477. , feb; Aleksander, I., Morton, H., (1990) An Introduction to Neural Computing, 3. , Chapman & Hall London; Amankwah, H., (2011) Mathematical Optimization Models and Methods for Open-pit Mining, , PhD thesis, Linköping University; Araujo, A.C., Montini, A.A., Teoria do portfólio: comparaç ões entre modelos alternativos para alocaç ão de recursos em ativos de risco (2011) Enanpad, , http://goo.gl/G5HL4I; Bitran, G.R., Haas, E.A., Hax, A.C., Hierarchical production planning: A single stage system (1981) Operations Research, 29 (4), pp. 717-743. , aug; Cadenas, J.M., Carrillo, J.V., Garrido, M.C., Ivorra, C., Liern, V., Exact and heuristic procedures for solving the fuzzy portfolio selection problem (2011) Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making, 11 (1), pp. 29-46. , nov; Carpenter, G.A., Neural network models for pattern recognition and associative memory (1989) Neural Networks, 2 (4), pp. 243-257; Collette, Y., Siarry, P., (2003) Multiobjective Optimization: Principles and Case Studies, , Springer Science & Business Media; Costa, H.R., Evaluating software project portfolio risks (2007) Journal of Systems and Software, 80 (1), pp. 16-31; Dye, L.D., Pennypacker, J.S., (2003) Project Portfolio Management: Selecting and Prioritizing Projects for Competitive Advantage (Business/ Management Series).; Goldbarg, M.C., Luna, H.P.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Wolsey, L.A., Hu, T.C., Salkin, H.M., Syslo, M.M., Kowalk, J.S., (2005) Otimizaç Ão Combinatória.

The hopping ceases to occur when the best pool to be mined is found. The choice of the best pool is based on statistical data generated and collected during the operation of the Bitcoin network. Experiments for validation and performance analysis are based on mining networks built specifically for this purpose. The major results show for instance that the bitcoin generation increases at 46.0% comparing to when the mining is carried out in only one isolated pool. Additionally, it is evaluated the possibility of implementing a distributed application making use of the proposed algorithm.

Almost two-thirds of overall social media users affirm an everyday usage of a social media website and, therefore, the data volume across this platforms is huge. Natural language processing of social media texts is an attractive topic among researchers of this area. While there are many studies about natural language processing of social media texts for some languages (e.g., English), the researches for Brazilian Portuguese language are still limited. Then, in this paper, a methodology is proposed to deal with peculiarities of the Brazilian Portuguese language in informal, short and noisy texts, where the lack of context poses obstacles in text mining. The proposed methodology has been evaluated in two tasks (Text Categorization and Opinion Mining) and experiments showed that the preprocessing mechanisms included in this methodology were important to achieve better results. © 2016 ACM.","Natural language processing; Online Social Networks; Text mining","Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; NAtural language processing; On-line social networks; Opinion mining; Portuguese languages; Social media; Social media websites; Text categorization; Text mining; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Avanço, L.V., Duran, M.S., Nunes, M.D.G.V., Towards a phonetic brazilian Portuguese spell checker (2014) The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese - PROPOR; Bontcheva, K., Derczynski, L., Funk, A., Greenwood, M.A., Maynard, D., Aswani, N., Twitie: An open-source information extraction pipeline for microblog text (2013) RANLP, pp. 83-90; Bontcheva, K., Rout, D., Making sense of social media streams through semantics: A survey (2014) Semantic Web, 5 (5), pp. 373-403; De Moura Silva, W.D.C., (2013) Aprimorando O Corretor Gramatical CoGrOO, , PhD thesis, Universidade de São Paulo; De Oliveira, D.M., Laender, A.H., Veloso, A., Da Silva, A.S., Fs-ner: A lightweight filter-stream approach to named entity recognition on twitter data (2013) Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 597-604. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; De Paiva, V., Rademaker, A., De Melo, G., Openwordnet-pt: An open brazilian wordnet for reasoning (2012) Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, , http://www.coling2012-iitb.org, Demonstration Paper.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of three methods of machine learning (Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Maximum Entropy) to detect polarities in two different scenarios. The first scenario is characterized as a three-class problem (positive, negative, and neutral). The second scenario consists of only two classes (positive and negative). Our dataset consists of comments from the Foursquare social network. The results show that Support Vector Machine presents an F-score at least 1.9% higher than the others for the three-class scenario, while Multinomial Naive Bayes presents an F-score at least 2.6% higher than the others for two-class scenario. © 2016 ACM.","Foursquare; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning","Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Complex networks; Data mining; Learning systems; Maximum entropy methods; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; F-score; Foursquare; Language complexity; Multinomial naive bayes; Portuguese languages; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Quality control",,,,,,,,"Aisopos, F., Papadakis, G., Tserpes, K., Varvarigou, T., Content vs. Context for sentiment analysis: A comparative analysis over microblogs (2012) Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, pp. 187-196. , ACM; Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (2013) Recuperação de Informação-: Conceitos e Tecnologia das Máquinas de Busca, , Bookman Editora; Go, A., Bhayani, R., Huang, L., Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision (2009) CS224N Project Report, Stanford, 1, p. 12; Kibriya, A.M., Frank, E., Pfahringer, B., Holmes, G., Multinomial naive bayes for text categorization revisited (2004) Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 488-499. , Springer; Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5 (1), pp. 1-167; Martins, R.F., Pereira, A., Benevenuto, F., An approach to sentiment analysis of web applications in Portuguese (2015) Proceedings of the 21st ACM Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, pp. 105-112. , ACM; McCallum, A., Nigam, K., A comparison of event models for naive bayes text classification (1998) Proceedings of AAAI Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 752, pp. 41-48. , Citeseer; Moraes, F., Vasconcelos, M., Prado, P., Almeida, J., Gonçalves, M., Polarity analysis of micro reviews in foursquare (2013) Proceedings of the 19th ACM Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, pp. 113-120. , ACM; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2 (1-2), pp. 1-135; Pang, B., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up?: Sentiment classification using machine learning techniques (2002) Proceedings of the ACL-02 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 99, pp. 79-86. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Serrano-Guerrero, J., Olivas, J.A., Romero, F.P., Herrera-Viedma, E., Sentiment analysis: A review and comparative analysis of web services (2015) Information Sciences, 311, pp. 18-38; Turney, P.D., Thumbs up or thumbs down?: Semantic orientation applied to unsupervised classification of reviews (2002) Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 417-424. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Wilson, T., Wiebe, J., Hoffmann, P., Recognizing contextual polarity: An exploration of features for phrase-level sentiment analysis (2009) Computational Linguistics, 35 (3), pp. 399-433",,,"Brazilian Computer Society (SBC);CAPES;Comite Gestor da Internet no Brasil (CGI.br);Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq);InfoWay;Nucleo de Informacao e Coordenacao do Ponto BR (NIC.br)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","22nd Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, WebMedia 2016","8 November 2016 through 11 November 2016",,124707,,9781450345125,,,"Portuguese","WebMedia - Proc.

Almost all content that people produces is now available in digital formats, like e-books, apps, newspapers, and magazines. That content has commonly some metadata available that can be used to generate complex recommendation systems that track content similarity. Since there is some effort in the literature to explore this direction, almost all use classical recommendation approaches, like collaborative filter data and information present on websites that sells books. While most efforts in the literature use features derived from the text syntax to create a recommendation model, our approach aims to trace an emotional fingerprint of authors extracted from their texts. This approach, known as psychometry, consists of the study of behavioral characteristics like positivity, negativity, sadness, fear, religiosity, sexuality, which are able to disguise individuals. Using two sentiment analysis lexicons and a collection of 641 books from the English literature written by 56 authors, we show the effectiveness of these psychometric features in order to trace those authors emotional fingerprint. © 2016 ACM.","Authorship identification; Language features; Lexical semantics; Sentiment analysis","Data mining; Recommender systems; Semantics; Authorship identification; Behavioral characteristics; Content similarity; Data and information; English literature; Language features; Lexical semantics; Sentiment analysis; Electronic publishing",,,,,,,,"Project Gutenberg, , http://www.gutenberg.org; Araujo, M., Diniz, J.P., Bastos, L., Soares, E., Junior, M., Ferreira, M., Ribeiro, F., Benevenuto, F., Ifeel 2.0: A multilingual benchmarking system for sentence-level sentiment analysis (2016) ICWSM; Cheng, N., Chandramouli, R., Subbalakshmi, K., Author gender identification from text (2011) Digital Investigation, 8 (1), pp. 78-88; Diederich, J., Kindermann, J., Leopold, E., Paass, G., Authorship attribution with support vector machines (2003) Applied Intelligence, 19 (1-2), pp. 109-123; Frye, C., (2016) The Religion and Political View of Jules Verne; Gonçalves, P., Benevenuto, F., Cha, M., (2013) Panas-t: A Psychometric Scale for Measuring Sentiments on Twitter, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.1857; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The weka data mining software: An update (2009) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11 (1), pp. 10-18; Hillesund, T., Will e-books change the world?

This area expects to develop computational systems that can monitor and respond to the affective states of an interacting user (IU). These affective states can be observed in terms of emotional responses, which demands continuous monitoring of IU. However, emotional responses can vary according to differences in personality traits. Due to that, we propose a novel model for personality-based agents to produce different emotional responses. This model suggests that distinct personality-based agents could have particular emotional responses. To evaluate our model, we collected data from an on-line social network in which entries have personality expressed by users and emotional information associated. We produced two personality-based agents: one extroverted and another introverted. Experimental results indicate that our model can be promising in providing distinct personality-based agents. The extroverted agent performed better on texts written by extroverted individuals just as the introverted agent performed better on texts written by introverted individuals. Our achieved results point out that personality traits are relevant to produce emotional agents. © 2016 ACM.","Affective computing; Intelligent systems; Text mining","Intelligent systems; Affective Computing; Computational system; Continuous monitoring; Emotional information; Emotional response; On-line social networks; Personality traits; Text mining; Data mining",,,,,,,,"De Andrade, J.M., (2008) Evidências de Validade do Inventário dos Cinco Grandes Fatores de Personalidade para O Brasil; Bao, S., Xu, S., Zhang, L., Yan, R., Su, Z., Han, D., Yu, Y., Mining social emotions from affective text (2012) Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 24 (9), pp. 1658-1670; Calvo, R.A., MacKim, S., Emotions in text: Dimensional and categorical models (2013) Computational Intelligence, 29 (3), pp. 527-543; Costa, P.T., McCrae, R.R., Influence of extraversion and neuroticism on subjective well-being: Happy and unhappy people (1980) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 38 (4), p. 668; Cowie, R., Douglas-Cowie, E., Tsapatsoulis, N., Votsis, G., Kollias, S., Fellenz, W., Taylor, J.G., Emotion recognition in human-computer interaction (2001) Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE, 18 (1), pp. 32-80; D'Mello, S.K., Graesser, A., Language and discourse are powerful signals of student emotions during tutoring (2012) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 5 (4), pp. 304-317; Ekman, P., Basic emotions (1999) Handbook of Cognition and Emotion, 98, pp. 45-60; El Gohary, A.F., Sultan, T.I., Hana, M.A., El, M.M., (2013) A Computational Approach for Analyzing and Detecting Emotions in Arabic Text; Gray, J.A., The psychophysiological basis of introversion-extraversion (1970) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 8 (3), pp. 249-266; Luyckx, K., Daelemans, W., Using syntactic features to predict author personality from text (1998) Science, 22, pp. 319-346; Mehrabian, A., Russell, J.A., (1974) An Approach to Environmental Psychology, , M.

As the internet extended its reach throughout the globe, the need for tools to enable information exchange between people who do not speak the same language emerged, to this need the most common response has been the use of Machine Translation. Some researchers have also evaluated the use of machine translation in SA and some interesting results were obtained. This work introduces Opinion-meter, a system for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis that enable users to analyze texts in several languages with the use of Machine Translation and using various methods based on PMI, Lexicon and Machine Learning. An evaluation of the methods available in the system was made in four different languages and the results suggest that although Machine Translation can yield reasonable results, Machine Learning may still be a better alternative. © 2016 ACM.","Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Machine learning; Machine translation; Sentiment analysis on the web","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data mining; Learning systems; Information exchanges; Machine translations; Sentiment analysis; Text content; Translation (languages)",,,,,,,,"Araujo, M., Reis, J., Pereira, A., Benevenuto, F., An evaluation of machine translation for multilingual sentence-level sentiment analysis (2016) Proc.of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1140-1145; Baldridge, J., (2005) The Opennlp Project, , http://opennlp.apache.org/index.html; Borgman, C.L., Multi-media, multi-cultural, and multilingual digital libraries (1997) D-lib, 3 (6); Chowdhury, G.G., Natural language processing (2003) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 37 (1), pp. 51-89; Guo, H., Zhu, H., Guo, Z., Zhang, X., Su, Z., Opinionit: A text mining system for cross-lingual opinion analysis (2010) Proc.of the 19th ACM Int.

One of the technological challenges concerns its storage in a safe, compact, low mass and high gravimetric capacity manner. In this sense, many Hydrogen Storage Materials (HSM) have been investigated to house this source of energy, such as Simple Hydrides, Borohydrides, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Alanates, AB5 Alloys, Ammonia Borane, Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene. Scientific advances aside, less attention has been paid in establishing a panorama of the technological developments in HSM. To assess the technological advances in HSM, patent analysis can be carried out using bibliometrics and text mining approaches in order to forecast the future trend of development and the main players involved in this process. In this work, we evaluated the technological life cycle stage, HSM class prominence and the role of different countries in HSM patenting. The results show that overall HSM patenting decreased after 2007, except in the case of China. On the other hand, the USA, Japan, China and the European Union (EU) were the main patenting territories. Simple Hydrides and Borohydrides were the main classes of HSM that received more attention from the USA and the EU, while Japan had a high share in Solid Solution Alloys. The life cycle stage of HSM seems to be between the first prototype market experiences and full market deployment, even though future assessment is needed to fine-tune the analysis. The developed indicators may also support the funding of new projects and decision making. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bibliometrics; Hydrogen storage; Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Technological forecasting","Carbon; Commerce; Crystalline materials; Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage alloys; Information science; Life cycle; Organometallics; Patents and inventions; Storage (materials); Technological forecasting; Yarn; Bibliometrics; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Solid solution alloy; Technological advances; Technological challenges; Technological development; Hydrogen storage",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES

Plain text files, written in seven different languages, were encoded by seven cryptographic algorithm under ECB mode. The resulting cryptograms were submitted to a transformation so that it was possible to create metadata files. These files provide information for six data mining algorithms in order to identify the cryptographic algorithm used for encryption. The identification performance was evaluated and the language influence at the procedure was analyzed. The overall experiment involves many cryptograms, a great quantity of metadata, a huge time consuming computation, and therefore, it was employed a high performance computer. The successful identification for each mining algorithm is greater than a probabilistic bid, and there are several scenarios where algorithm identification reaches almost full recognition. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","cryptographic algorithm identification; data mining; machine intelligence; parallel computing","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Metadata; Parallel processing systems; Cryptographic algorithms; Data mining algorithm; Encryption algorithms; High performance computers; Machine intelligence; Machine learning techniques; Mining algorithms; Plain text; Cryptography",,,,,,,,"Flávio Mendonça, B., Arthur Reimão Santos Figueiredo, V., De Flávio Luis, M., Machine Learning for Cryptographic Algorithm Identification, 3, p. 2016. , in print, Enigma-Brazilian Journal of Information Security and Cryptography; Tanenbaum, A., (2011) Computer Network, 5. , Boston Pearson; Pfleeger, C.P., Pfleeger, S.L., (2006) Security in Computing, , Boston Prentice Hall; Nie, T., Song, C., Zhi, X., Performance evaluation of des and blowfish algorithms (2010) International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science (ICBECS), , 1-4, Wuhan; Verma, O.P., Agarwal, R., Dafouti, D., Tyagi, S., Performance analysis of data encryption algorithms (2011) 3rd International Conference on Electronics Computer Technology (ICECT), pp. 399-403. , Kanyakumari; Poonia, V., Yadav, N.S., Analysis of modified Blowfish Algorithm in different cases with various parameters (2015) International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems, , 1-5, Coimbatore; Hammood, M.M., Yoshigoe, K., Sagheer, A.M., RC4-2S: RC4 stream cipher with two state tables (2013) Information Technology Convergence, 253, pp. 13-20; Gupta, S., Chattopadhyay, A., Sinha, K., Maitra, S., Sinha, B., Highperformance hardware implementation for RC4 stream cipher (2013) IEEE Transaction Computers, 62 (4), pp. 730-743; Fluhrer, S., Mantin, I., Shamir, A., Weakness in the key scheduling algorithm of rc4 (2001) Selected Areas of Cryptography, 2259, pp. 1-24; Mantin, I., Shamir, A., A pratical attack on broadcast rc4 (2002) Fast Software Encryption, 2355, pp. 152-164; Goutam, P., Subhamoy, M., (2007) RC4 State Information at Any Stage Reveals the Secret Key, , IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive; Vanhoef, M., Piessens, F., All your biases belong to us: Breaking RC4 in WPA-TKIP and TLS (2015) Proceedings of the 24th USENIX Conference on Security Symposium, , 12-14, Washington; Coutinho, C.S., (2003) Números Inteiros e Criptografia RSA, , IMPA, Rio de Janeiro; Joan, D., Vincent, R., (2002) The Design of Rijndael, , Berlin Springer; Ross, A., Eli, B., Lars, K., Serpent: A flexible block cipher with maximum assurance (1998) First AES Candidate Conference, Califonia; Bruce, S., John, K., Doug, W., David, W., Chris, H., Niels, F., (1999) The Twofish Encryption Algorithm: A 128-bit Block Cipher, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Also, it intends to use the Case-Based Reasoning strategy in order to learn from past reasonings (polarizations) so they can be used in new polarizations. Some steps have been developed for treatment of negation, adequacy of sentiment lexicon for a domain and adaptation of ambiguous terms classification based on past ratings. Tests were developed in two distinct areas, digital cameras and movies, to justify the model evolution until its final proposal. It was observed that the accuracy obtained by the proposed model overcomes standard statistical approaches. These results demonstrate that the model contributes to the sentiment analysis area, both as a solution that provides high levels of accuracy, as well as the possibility to present the track to achieve a particular classification. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Case-Based Reasoning; Inference; Ontology; Sentiment Analysis; Sentiment Tree","Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Polarization; Domain ontologies; Inference; Model evolution; NAtural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment lexicons; Sentiment Tree; Statistical approach; Case based reasoning",,,,,,,,"Pai, M.Y., Electronic word of mouth analysis for service experience (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40, pp. 1993-2006; Atkinson, J., Salas, G., Figueroa, A., Improving opinion retrieval in social media by combining features-based coreferencing and memory-based learning (2015) Information Sciences, 299, pp. 20-31; Qiu, G., Opinion word expansionand target extractionthrough double propagation (2011) Computational Linguistics, 37 (1), p. 927. , Março; Zangh, L., Liu, B., Identifying noun product features that imply opinions (2011) 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies: Short Papers, 2; Peñalver-Martinez, I., Feature-based opinion mining through ontologies (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (13), pp. 5995-6008; Li, S.T., Tsai, F.C., A fuzzy conceptualization model for text mining with application in opinion polarity classification (2013) Knowledge-Based Systems, 39, pp. 23-33; Liu, L., Generating domain-specific affective ontology from Chinese reviews for sentiment analysis (2015) Journal of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Science), 20, pp. 32-37; Li, L., Xia, Y., Zhang, P., An unsupervised approach to sentiment word extraction in complex sentiment analysis (2011) International Journal of Knowledge and Language Processing, 2, pp. 40-52; Feng, S., Extracting common emotions from blogs based on fine-grained sentiment clustering (2011) Knowledge and Information Systems, 27 (2), pp. 281-302; Kaiser, C., Schlick, S., Bodendorf, F., Warning system for online market research-identifying critical situations in online opinion formation (2011) Knowledge-Based Systems, 24 (6), pp. 824-836; Wang, W., Xu, H., Wan, W., Implicit feature identification via hybrid association rule mining (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (9), pp. 3518-3531; Kim, S.M., Hovy, E., Determining the sentiment of opinions (2004) The 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics Proceedings of COLING.

Consequently, these media are constantly being examined by sentiment analysis systems which aim at classifying the posts as positive or negative. Given the variety of topics discussed and the short length of the posts, the standard approach of using the words as features for machine learning algorithms results in sparse vectors. In this work, we propose using features derived from the ranking generated by an Information Retrieval System in response to a query consisting of the post that needs to be classified. Our system can be fully automatic, has only 24 features, and does not depend on expensive resources. Experiments on real datasets have shown that a classifier that relies solely on these features outperforms established baselines and can reach accuracies comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches which are more costly. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The language, however, still lacks proper support in the form of warnings about potential bugs in the code. Most bug findings tools in use today cover bug patterns that are discovered by reading best practices or through developer intuition and anecdotal observation. As such, it is still unclear which bugs happen frequently in practice and which are important for developers to be fixed. We propose a novel semi-Automatic technique, called BugAID, for discovering the most prevalent and detectable bug patterns. BugAID is based on unsupervised machine learning using languageconstruct-based changes distilled from AST differencing of bug fixes in the code. We present a large-scale study of common bug patterns by mining 105K commits from 134 server-side JavaScript projects. We discover 219 bug fixing change types and discuss 13 pervasive bug patterns that occur across multiple projects and can likely be prevented with better tool support. Our findings are useful for improving tools and techniques to prevent common bugs in JavaScript, guiding tool integration for IDEs, and making developers aware of common mistakes involved with programming in JavaScript. © 2016 ACM.","Bug Patterns; Data Mining; Javascript; Node.Js; Static Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Software engineering; Static analysis; Bug Patterns; Javascript; Large-scale studies; Multiple projects; Node.Js; Semi-automatics; Tools and techniques; Unsupervised machine learning; High level languages",,,,,,,,"(2014) Error Handling in Node.js, , https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors; (2016) BugAID: Source Code, , https://github.com/saltlab/bugaid; (2016) BugAID: Toolset and Dataset, , http://salt.ece.ubc.ca/software/bugaid/; Alimadadi, S., Mesbah, A., Pattabiraman, K., Hybrid DOM-sensitive change impact analysis for JavaScript (2015) Proceedings of the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP, pp. 321-345; Alimadadi, S., Sequeira, S., Mesbah, A., Pattabiraman, K., Understanding JavaScript event-based interactions (2014) Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pp. 367-377. , ACM; (2016) Argument-validator.

HTLV-1 ORF-I produces the protein p12 and its cleavage product p8. The functions of these proteins have been linked to immune evasion and viral infectivity and persistence. It is known that the HTLV-1 infection does not necessarily imply the development of pathological processes and here we evaluated whether natural mutations in HTLV-1 ORF-I can influence the proviral load and clinical manifestation of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). For that, we performed molecular characterization, datamining and phylogenetic analysis with HTLV-1 ORF-I sequences from 156 patients with negative or positive diagnosis for HAM/TSP. Our analyses demonstrated that some mutations may be associated with the outcome of HAM/TSP (C39R, L40F, P45L, S69G and R88K) or with proviral load (P34L and F61L). We further examined the presence of mutations in motifs of HBZ and observed that P45L mutation is located within the HBZ nuclear localization signal and was found more frequently between patients with HAM/TSP and high proviral load. These results indicate that some natural mutations are located in functional domains of ORF-I and suggests a potential association between these mutations and the proviral loads and development of HAM/TSP. Therefore it is necessary to conduct functional studies aimed at evaluating the impact of these mutations on the virus persistence and immune evasion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","HAM/TSP; HTLV-1; ORF-1","basic leucine zipper transcription factor; protein p12; protein p8; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus RNA; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; Article; consensus sequence; controlled study; data mining; genetic distance; human; Human T cell leukemia virus infection; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; major clinical study; mutation; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; open reading frame; open reading frame I; phylogeny; priority journal; proviral load; tropical spastic paraparesis; virus load; genetics; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; molecular epidemiology; mutation; open reading frame; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; virology; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Mutation; Open Reading Frames; Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic; RNA, Viral; Viral Load",,"RNA, Viral",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Approximately 15 km2 were flooded along the rivers Gualaxo do Norte, Carmo and Doce, reaching the Atlantic Ocean on November 22nd, 2015. Six days after, our group collected mud, soil and water samples in Bento Rodrigues (Minas Gerais, Brazil), which was the first impacted area. Overall, the results, water samples – potable and surface water from river – presented chemical elements concentration according to Brazilian environmental legislations, except silver concentration in surface water that ranged from 1.5 to 1087 μg L−1. In addition, water mud-containing presented Fe and Mn concentrations approximately 4-fold higher than the maximum limit for water bodies quality assessment, according to Brazilian laws. Mud particle size ranged from 1 to 200 μm. SEM-EDS spot provided us some semi quantitative data. Leaching/extraction tests suggested that Ba, Pb, As, Sr, Fe, Mn and Al have high potential mobilization from mud to water. Low microbial diversity in mud samples compared to background soil samples. Toxicological bioassays (HepG2 and Allium cepa) indicated potential risks of cytotoxicity and DNA damage in mud and soil samples used in both assays. The present study provides preliminary information aiming to collaborate to the development of future works for monitoring and risk assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cytotoxicity; Genotoxicity; Mariana's disaster; Metals; Single extraction procedures","Chemical elements; Cytotoxicity; Lead; Manganese; Manganese removal (water treatment); Metals; Particle size; Potable water; Risk assessment; Rivers; Soil surveys; Soils; Environmental legislations; Genotoxicities; Microbial diversity; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Preliminary information; Quality assessment; Silver concentration; Single extraction; Surface waters; aluminum; arsenic; barium; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; selenium; silver; strontium; surface water; zinc; cytotoxin; heavy metal; mutagenic agent; soil; water; water pollutant; concentration (composition); extraction; genotoxicity; heavy metal; mining industry; mud; risk assessment; water pollution; water quality; Article; Brazil; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; environmental monitoring; genotoxicity; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; leaching; microbial diversity; mining; nonhuman; onion; particle size; risk assessment; soil analysis; water analysis; water quality; adverse effects; Allium; analysis; Atlantic Ocean; chemistry; drug effects; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Hep-G2 cell line; microbiology; risk; river; soil; structure collapse; toxicity; water pollutant; Brazil; Doce Basin; Minas Gerais; Allium cepa; Allium; Atlantic Ocean; Brazil; Cytotoxins; DNA Damage; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Mutagens; Particle Size; Risk; Rivers; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Structure Collapse; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; arsenic, 7440-38-2; barium, 7440-39-3; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; cobalt, 7440-48-4; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nickel, 7440-02-0; selenium, 7782-49-2; silver, 7440-22-4; strontium, 7440-24-6; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; water, 7732-18-5; Cytotoxins; Metals, Heavy; Mutagens; Soil; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP: 2014/05151-0, 2015/066749-0

Paulista, SP, Brazil","Machine learning (ML) based applications that require data stream processing have become quite common over the past few years. To deal with continuous and massive streams of data, low computational and memory costs are required from the ML techniques employed; these requirements can be partially fulfilled by using constructive neural networks (CoNN) algorithms. The automatic definition of the Neural Network (NN) architecture, as well as its fast training, promote the high adaptability of such NNs, which allows to skip the conventional model selection phase during the learning process. However, such advantages usually come with the drawback of promoting lower accuracy rates, when compared to other learning approaches. The work described in this paper proposes an ensemble of CoNNs combined with functional expansion techniques to cope with data stream classification. The experiment results, followed by a comparative analysis, showed that CoNN accuracy performance along streaming data does improve with the use of functional expansion. Considering that to functionally expand the input data has a low computational cost, the obtained results turn CoNN algorithms an interesting approach to be considered in data stream classification. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data communication systems; Data handling; Data mining; Learning systems; Neural networks; Classification process; Comparative analysis; Constructive neural network; Conventional modeling; Data stream classifications; Data stream processing; Functional expansion; Neural network (nn); Classification (of information)",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

This way, it is expected to advance in two main questions concerning multilayer perceptrons (MLPs): how to determine the network architecture and how to build models that are more comprehensible. Based on the normalized information gain of each attribute, the algorithm builds the network architecture. In the process, it automatically creates a set of training examples for each individual neuron and executes single-cell learning. Once the network is created and trained, particle swarm optimization is utilized to evolve the connections of the network. Five metrics were utilized to validate the method when compared to decision trees and MLPs: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and comprehensibility. The experiments were executed in thirteen different databases and the results suggest that the proposed algorithm can generate neural networks with good classification performance and more comprehensible. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge extraction from neural networks","Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Trees (mathematics); Classification performance; Constructive algorithms; Constructive neural network; Evolutionary approach; Information gain; Knowledge extraction; Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs); Tree-like structures; Evolutionary algorithms",,,,,,,,"Banerjee, A., Initializing neural networks using decision trees (1994) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Learning and Natural Learning Systems, pp. 3-15. , MIT Press; Beckert-Neto, A., Nievola, J.C., Vinicius, M., Figueredo, M., Rogal, S.R., Jr., Automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmias using wavelets, neural networks, and particle swarm optimization (2010) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Industrial Technology - IEEE/ICIT 2010, 1, pp. 1-5. , Vina del Mar, Valparaiso, Chile, IEEE Press; Chen, Y., Abraham, A., Feature selection and intrusion detection using hybrid flexible neural tree (2005) International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN 03, pp. 439-444. , Lecture; Chen, Y., Peng, L., Abraham, A., Exchange rate forecasting using flexible neural trees (2006) Advances in Neural Networks - ISNN 2006, 3973, pp. 518-523. , Jun.

Musical databases have considerably increased in number and size over the past years, therefore, the development of accurate tools for music information retrieval (MIR) has become an important topic in computer science. The increasing theoretical advances in machine learning algorithms together with the abundance of recordings available in digital audio formats, the growing quality and accessibility of on-line symbolic music data, and availability of tools and toolboxes for the extraction of musical properties have motivated many studies on machine learning and MIR. Relevant problems in MIR include classification of songs into genres, which enables the summarization of common features (or patterns) shared by different songs. The automatic classification of music genres plays a fundamental role in the context of music indexing and retrieval, so that websites and device music engines can manage and label music content. Most studies have dealt with such an issue by extracting music characteristics from the audio content, and some have provided overviews of audio features and classification algorithms for music genre classification. However, precise high-level musical information can be extracted from symbolic data (e.g. digital music scores), known to be closely related to the way humans perceive music. A number of approaches use such musical information to process, retrieve and classify music content. This manuscript provides an overview of the most important approaches that deal with music genre classification and consider the symbolic representation of music data. Current issues inherent to such a music format, as well the main algorithms adopted for the modeling of the music feature space are presented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to evaluate whether an acidic mine waste (AMW) could be used beneficially by reacting it with sparingly soluble phosphate rocks (PRs) to produce more soluble P fertilizer materials. Three PRs from Brazil and Peru were reacted with different concentrations of AMW. Changes in mineralogy and P species were determined using a combination of X-ray diffraction and phosphorus K-edge XANES spectroscopy, in addition to extractable P concentrations. Increasing the AMW concentration typically increased extractable P. X-ray diffraction data showed transformation of apatite to other species when PRs were reacted with AMW at =50% (v/v) in water, with gypsum or anhydrite forming at AMW concentrations as low as 12.5%. Linear combination fitting analysis of X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra also indicated a progressive transformation of apatite to noncrystalline Fe(III)-phosphate and more soluble Ca-phosphates with increasing AMW concentration. Because this AMW is costly to dispose of, reacting it with PR to produce a higher-grade phosphate fertilizer material could decrease the environmental impacts of the AMW and diminish the consumption of pure acids in conventional P fertilizer production. ©American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Apatite; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Minerals; Phosphate deposits; Phosphate fertilizers; Phosphate minerals; X ray absorption; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Acidic mine waste; Environmental footprints; Global population; Linear combinations; Phosphorus K-edge; Soluble phosphates; X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra; X-ray diffraction data; Waste treatment; apatite; calcium sulfate; phosphate; phosphate fertilizer; ferric ion; fertilizer; phosphate; phosphorus; water; acidification; acidity; agronomy; Article; biotransformation; chemical composition; controlled study; environmental impact; industrial waste; mineralogy; mining; rock; soil property; solubility; species differentiation; chemistry; pH; sewage; Ferric Compounds; Fertilizers; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water",,"apatite, 64476-38-6; calcium sulfate, 13397-24-5, 23296-15-3, 7778-18-9; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; ferric ion, 20074-52-6; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; water, 7732-18-5; Ferric Compounds; Fertilizers; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Water",,,,,,"Alcarde, J.C., Manual de análise de fertilizantes (2009) FEALQ, Piracicaba, 1. , Brazil; Beauchemin, S., Hesterberg, D., Chou, J., Beauchemin, M., Simard, R.R., Sayers, D.E., Speciation of phosphorus in phosphorus-enriched agricultural soils using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and chemical fractionation (2003) J.

The subject of this work is to demonstrate the same start/stop functionality applied as a retrofit solution for off road vehicles that have high fuel consumption and operate many hours a day. The start/stop retrofit (SSR) solution includes an ECU added in the vehicle acting as the system's controller, which must be adapted according to its specific application. These interventions are important discussions topics and include electrical modifications, battery monitoring strategies, adapted ways to retrieve the vehicle data and an important safety study to secure all the modifications.

This media is often characterized by its diverse content, which is produced by ordinary users. The potential to easily express ideas and opinions has made social media a source of valuable information on a variety of topics. In particular, information containing comments about consumer products has become prevalent. Here, we are interested in linking products mentioned in unstructured user-generated content, namely open discussion forums, to their respective entities in consumer product catalogs. Among the issues associated with this task, ambiguity is a particularly hard problem, as users typically refer to the same product using many different forms and different products may share the same form. We argue that this problem can be effectively solved using a set of evidences that can be easily extracted from social media content and product descriptions. To achieve this, we show which features should be used, how they can be extracted, and then how to combine them through machine learning techniques. Experiments in three different product categories and two different datasets demonstrate that all the sources of evidence here proposed are important, while contextual information is fundamental to achieve higher levels of precision. In fact, our method, although straightforward, was able to achieve an average improvement of 0.17 in precision and 0.13 in F1, when compared to the current state-of-the-art solution. © 2016 ACM.","Product linking; Social media; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Consumer products; Data mining; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Contextual information; Machine learning techniques; Online social medias; Product descriptions; Product linking; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 461231/2014-0

As a way to acquire the human activity data, there are external approaches (e.g. cameras data) and embedded approaches (e.g. accelerometer data). In this area, we can find solutions using multiple sensors simultaneously supporting the real time data acquisition. In the other hand, there are researchers focusing in an optimized and accurate way to classify the activity based on large amount of data. In this paper the Bayes Network and Neural Network classifiers were used. They were built from a public dataset regarding data acquired from accelerometers worn by a set of people. Considering the Data Mining classification steps, the attributes selection, the building and training, the validation tests were done, resulting in the Confusion Matrix, the accuracy rate and the processing time. The goal is to compare different classification methods using different building and training techniques, matching the dataset specifications and quirks, assessing the performance and accuracy rates impacts. A Java program was implemented using the Data Mining public library called Weka. With smaller processing times than the Bayes Network, the implemented Neural Networks had excellent results. The Bayes Network requires a further investigation on configuration and validation techniques, it had the largest processing times, and reached the best results using the k-fold cross-validation technique. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayes Network; Classifiers; Data Mining; Human Activity Recognition; Neural Network","Accelerometers; Bayesian networks; Classifiers; Computer software; Data acquisition; Data mining; Fuzzy systems; Java programming language; Libraries; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Bayes networks; Classification methods; Human activity recognition; K fold cross validations; Mining classification; Neural network classifier; Real time data acquisition; Training techniques; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Ugulino, W., Ferreira, M., Velloso, E., Fuks, H., Virtual caregiver: Colaboraçao de parentes no acompanhamento de idosos (2012) Anais Do SBSC 2012, IX Simpósio Brasileiro de Sistemas Colaborativos, pp. 43-48. , SP: IEEE.

The aim of this study is to assess the vulnerability of a coastal dune system and to identify the areas that result most sensitive to environmental changes. The CDVI has been applied along six transects traced out on two sectors that have been selected based on dune characteristics: Zone A is characterized by well developed parabolic dunes, whereas Zone B is characterized by transverse dunes. The analysis involved 51 quantitative and qualitative variables, divided into five groups: geomorphological dune system condition, marine influence, Aeolian effect, vegetation condition and human effect. The total CDVI was computed as the unweighted average of the partial vulnerability indices. In summary, the total vulnerability can be classified as medium: the geomorphological factor must be monitored at Grande beach, in particular the blowouts in Zone A and the frontal dune retreat in Zone B. The results of the study confirm that the management of coastal areas might be improved using a tool such as the CDVI, which can be easily applied on a regular basis to take under control the factors that mostly affect the evolution of the site.",,"Beaches; Data mining; Earth sciences; Mineral resources; Mining engineering; Mining laws and regulations; Remote sensing; Coastal area; Environmental change; Human effects; Parabolic dune; System conditions; Vegetation condition; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Environmental technology; beach; blowout; classification; coastal morphology; dune; environmental change; sensitivity analysis; transect; vulnerability; Brazil; Santa Catarina",,,,,,,,"Bertoni, D., Biagioni, C., Sarti, G., Ciccarelli, D., Ruocco, M., The role of sediment grain-size, mineralogy, and beach morphology on plant communities of two Mediterranean coastal dune systems (2014) Italian Journal of Geosciences, 133 (2), pp. 271-281. , 271-281; Ruocco, M., Bertoni, D., Sarti, G., Ciccarelli, D., Mediterranean coastal dune systems: Which abiotic factors have the most influence on plant communities?

In this last, one of the main uses of the eye tracking technology is for user testing, producing a large volume of data that must be analyzed effectively and efficiently. Of course, there is the idea of combining the concepts of mining the data from eye tracking devices. In order to address this issue, the goal of this work is to carry out a systematic survey of the literature on eye tracking and data mining. We selected some of the major digital libraries to search for articles related to these issues, and through formulated criteria we reached a final set of 16 articles to be analyzed. The analysis of such studies allowed us to reach to some conclusions, e.g., which techniques are the most used in data mining from eye tracking, which are the main forms of visualization of this data.

Considering the characteristics of the mechanisms and data related to yield, data mining techniques are suitable candidates for modelling. The use of these techniques within a context with feature engineering, feature selection, and proper tuning can further improve performance beyond a simple replacement of multiple linear regression. To evaluate the impact of the different steps in the mentioned context, we evaluated sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield modelling with data obtained from a sugarcane mill. For a combination of six techniques, tuning, feature selection, and feature engineering, leading to 66 combinations, we assessed final model performance. Average performance across combinations resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.42 Mg ha−1. Using different techniques led to a range of MAE from 4.57 to 8.80 Mg ha−1 on average. The best and worst performances for an individual model were MAEs of 4.11 and 9.00 Mg ha−1. Models with lower performance were close to simply predicting yield from the average yield for each number of cuts (MAE of 9.86 Mg ha−1). Tuning and feature engineering reduced the MAE on average by 1.17 and 0.64 Mg ha−1, respectively. Feature selection removed nearly 40% of the features but increased the MAE by 0.19 Mg ha−1. The performance of models was improved by simple strategies such as decomposing weather attributes and detailing fertilisation. Evaluation of feature importance provided by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm was used to explain the performance gains. If empirical models are needed, they will rely on using advanced techniques, but they will need proper algorithm tuning and feature engineering to extract most of the information from datasets. Based on the results, we recommend following the presented workflow for the development of yield models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural networks; Boosted regression trees; Machine learning; Random forest; Regression trees; Support vector machines","Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning systems; Linear regression; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Boosted regression trees; Feature engineerings; Feature selection algorithm; Individual modeling; Industrial supply chains; Multiple linear regressions; Random forests; Regression trees; Feature extraction; agricultural modeling; agricultural technology; agroindustry; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; data mining; decision making; machine learning; multiple regression; performance assessment; rainfed agriculture; sugar cane; vector autoregression; Saccharum",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES

It proposes a new data mining approach, called ‘DETECTS’, for the identification of those research and innovative activities whose intensity increases sharply compared to previous levels and to other developments. This approach also allows monitoring the extent to which field and topic-specific activities further accelerate, stabilise or abate, and the time it takes for such dynamics to unfold. By applying the ‘DETECTS’ methodology on data from scientific publications and patents, this work sheds light on: the structure, articulation and relevance of the most important scientific and technological developments occurred during the period 1990–2011; the extent to which new fields arise from the cross-fertilisation of different technologies; the way in which advancements in science relate to technological progress; and the areas where future developments are likely to occur in the short and medium term. Results further suggest, somewhat unexpectedly, that in some focal technology fields considered, the acceleration in the development of science seems to closely follow the acceleration in the development of technologies, and not vice versa. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Innovation; Patent; Science; Scientific publication; Technology paradigm and trajectory","Data mining; Innovation; Trajectories; Analysis-based approaches; Innovative activities; Patent; Science; Science and Technology; Scientific publications; Technological development; Technological progress; Patents and inventions",,,,,,,,"Adner, R., When are technologies disruptive?

Each data stored contains significant information that can assist the planning and operation of electrical system. In the data analysis step, many aspects must be considered such as the data consistency and the identification and treatment of outliers. This is a critical step because data quality is directly reflected in the results of the planning and operation of electrical system. This paper proposes two models for the identification and treatment of outliers in electrical load data. The first model was built using the ensemble technique through a combination of individual models. The second model was created from an expert system that uses a rules database to detect outliers. The processing of the outliers detected is conducted through a combination of non-outliers load in the same time interval. To evaluate the performance, the models were applied in a historical load database measured in the Northeast of Brazil during year of 2006. The results showed that the proposed models showed satisfactory results in terms of detection as well in the treatment of outliers. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Electrical Load Data; Ensembles; Expert Systems; Outlier Detection; Outliers Treatment","Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Data mining; Database systems; Expert systems; Electrical load; Electrical systems; Ensemble techniques; Ensembles; High dimensional data; Intelligent models; Outlier Detection; Outliers Treatment; Statistics",,,,,,,,"Onoghojobi, B., (2010) An Instant of Performance Criteria for Outlier Identification; Anscombe, F.J., Rejection of outliers (1960) Fine Particles, Thin Films and Exchange Anisotropy, "" in Magnetism, 3, pp. 271-350. , Technometrics;I.

Santos Neto, P., Department of Computing, Federal University of Piauí, Teresina, Piauí, Brazil","Background Preauthorisation is a control mechanism that is used by Health Insurance Providers (HIPs) to minimise wastage of resources through the denial of the procedures that were unduly requested. However, an efficient preauthorisation process requires the round-the-clock presence of a preauthorisation reviewer, which increases the operating expenses of the HIP. In this context, the aim of this study was to learn the preauthorisation process using the dental set from an existing database of a non-profit HIP. Methods Pre-processing data techniques as filtering algorithms, random under-sample and imputation were used to mitigate problems that arise from the selection of relevant attributes, class balancing and filling unknown data. The performance of classifiers Random Tree, Naive bayes, Support Vector Machine and Nearest Neighbor was evaluated according to kappa index and the best classifiers were combined by using ensembles. Results The number of attributes were reduced from 164 to 15 and also were created 12 new attributes from existing discrete data associated with the beneficiary's history. The final result was the development of a decision support mechanism that yielded hit rates above 96%. Conclusions It is possible to create a tool based on computational intelligence techniques to evaluate the requests of test/procedure with a high accuracy. This tool can be used to support the activities of the professionals and automatically evaluate less complex cases, like requests not involving risk to the life of patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Classification; Data mining; Ensemble; Machine learning; Prepaid health plans","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Decision support systems; Health insurance; Learning systems; Computational intelligence techniques; Control mechanism; Ensemble; Filtering algorithm; Health care professionals; Insurance providers; Performance of classifier; Prepaid health plans; Classification (of information); algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; classifier; decision support system; health care personnel; human; medical decision making; non profit organization; preauthorisation; priority journal; support vector machine; algorithm; artificial intelligence; Bayes theorem; clinical decision making; machine learning; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Clinical Decision-Making; Health Personnel; Humans; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine",,,,,"Instituto Nacional de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia para Engenharia de Software, INES

This paper investigates the application of support vector machines (SVMs) to control switched capacitor banks and voltage regulators of distribution systems in order to minimize system losses and maintain acceptable voltage profile. The objective is to develop an approach that can use voltage/current measurements provided by active and reactive monitors to IVVC control without the need to perform retraining or repeat optimization simulations. The performance of the SVM scheme for different input selection (i.e., active and reactive power and node voltage) is discussed. Moreover, the generality of the proposed SVM scheme is investigated under noisy environment as well as under network reconfiguration. Studies on a typical distribution system show that the proposed approach has been able to achieve satisfactory results. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This phenomenon was also observed during freezing exposure, severe dehydration, aerial exposure of water-breathing animals and estivation. However, as far as we know, there is no analysis available of the prevalence of POS among animal species. A major problem is the very definition of POS, since many animal species show both increases and decreases of antioxidants during low oxygen stress and estivation. Therefore, we established three different criteria; from inclusive to restrictive and analyzed how widespread the POS phenomenon is in the animal kingdom. We analyzed all available papers in several databases about the modulation of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation or estivation. Based on the magnitude of change (as % change) during the specific low oxygen stresses or estivation, we classified each species as POS-positive, POS-negative or POS-neutral, considering the three different criteria. The prevalence of POS-positive animals (102 species from 8 phyla) was stress-dependent: in estivation and dehydration it was 91–100%, while in hypoxia it was 37.5–53%, depending on the criteria. In the case of air exposure, anoxia and freezing the proportions of POS-positive species were 54–77%, 64–77% and 75–86%, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of POS was 58 to 68% when all stresses and all species were analyzed together. The results indicate the key importance of POS as a survival strategy of animals exposed to freezing, dehydration and estivation, and, to a lesser extent, to oxygen deprivation itself (i.e. hypoxia and anoxia). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Air exposure; Anoxia; Antioxidant; Dehydration; Estivation; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species","antioxidant; catalase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; manganese superoxide dismutase; metallothionein; oxygen; peroxiredoxin; selenium; selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antioxidant; enzyme; glutathione; aestivation; Amphibia; animal experiment; animal model; annelid; anoxia; arthropod; Article; bivalve; cephalopod; Chordata; Cnidaria; controlled study; dehydration; echinoderm; environmental exposure; freezing; hypoxia; insect; molecular biology; mollusc; nematode; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prevalence; reptile; species composition; survival rate; Tardigrada; adaptation; animal; biodiversity; data mining; enzymology; hypoxia; metabolism; pathophysiology; veterinary medicine; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antioxidants; Biodiversity; Data Mining; Enzymes; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative Stress",,"catalase, 9001-05-2; copper zinc superoxide dismutase, 149394-67-2; glutathione, 70-18-8; glutathione peroxidase, 9013-66-5; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; peroxiredoxin, 207137-51-7; selenium, 7782-49-2; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; Antioxidants; Enzymes; Glutathione",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: Universal 478648/2013-8

Since model precision and accuracy depends strongly on data quality, data generation is subject to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols that typically adopt error tolerance limits based on reference values. This paper proposes tolerance limits based on the relation between data acquisition costs and block misclassification rate sensitivity to data uncertainty. Using several scenarios generated by adding errors to sampled grades, approach applied to the Miraí bauxite deposit (Brazil) defined the optimum sampling error (measured by its CV) ranging within 6 and 15%. Moreover, sequential Gaussian simulation block classification performed better and was less sensitive to sampling uncertainty than ordinary kriging. The proposed approach results showed that sampling error optimisation is an opportunity to improve mine’s profitability that must be carefully investigated even in benchmark mines. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and The AusIMM.

All the available information should be incorporated when constructing a grade model. However, the variations in length among the samples must be considered during estimation. We propose to perform kriging using samples of different support. The kriging system is built using average covariances to account for the difference in support between the samples. The technique is applied in a mineral deposit. The resulting grade model is validated with visual inspection and swath plots. Cross validation was used to compare the proposed approach against kriging using point covariances, which disregards the difference in support between the data. Results show that the use of average covariances in the kriging system improved both the accuracy and the precision of the estimates. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and The AusIMM.

We first estimated an Origin-Destination matrix of bus users based on datasets about ticket validation and GPS positioning of buses. Then we represented the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario and, in particular, apply community discovery techniques in order to identify clusters in the service supply infrastructure. Finally, by superimposing the flow of people represented in the Origin-Destination matrix in the supply network, we exemplify how micro-interventions can be prospected, by means of an example of introducing express routes. © 2016 IEEE.","Complex networks; Data mining; Urban mobility","Bus transportation; Complex networks; Data mining; Matrix algebra; Transportation; Community discoveries; Digital sensors; GPS positioning; Mobility pattern; Origin destination matrices; Pattern discovery; Transportation network; Urban mobility; Urban transportation",,,,,,,,"Wang, W., Attanucci, J., Wilson, N., Bus passenger origin-Destination estimation and related analyses using automated data collection systems (2011) Journal of Public Transportation, 14 (4), pp. 131-150; De Solà-Morales, M., The strategy of urban acupuncture (2004) Structure Fabric and Topography Conference, , Nanjing University; Exploring the network structure and nodal centrality of China's air transport network: A complex network approach (2011) Journal of Transport Geography, pp. 712-721; Tugores, L.M., Colet, A., Ramasco, P., Tweets on the road (2014) PLOSone, 9 (8); Munizaga, M., Palma, C., Fischer, D., (2011) Estimation of a Disaggregate Multimodal Public Transport OD Matrix from Passive Smart Card Data from Santiago, Chile.

We studied three popular forums: Oracle Java Cryptography, Google Android Developers, and Google Android Security Discussions. We applied a data mining technique, namely Apriori, to elicit association rules among cryptographic bad practices, platform-specific issues, cryptographic programming tasks, and cryptography-related use cases. We found that, with surprisingly high probabilities (90% for Java and 71% for Android), several types of cryptography misuse can be found in the posts, but unfortunately masked by technology-specific issues and programming concerns. We also found that cryptographic bad practices frequently occur in pairs or triples. We related triple associations to use cases and tasks, characterizing worst case scenarios of cryptography misuse. Finally, we observed that hard-to-use architectures confuse developers and contribute to perpetuate recurring errors in cryptographic programming. © 2016 IEEE.","Apriori algorithm; cryptography misuse; data mining; Java cryptographic architecture; secure coding","Android (operating system); C (programming language); Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Java programming language; Mobile security; Network security; Social networking (online); Software reliability; Android securities; Apriori algorithms; Cryptographic architecture; High probability; Programming tasks; Secure coding; Software developer; Worst case scenario; Cryptography",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

To derive these clusters, the data input required is often a single n × n dissimilarity matrix. Yet for many applications, more than one instance of the dissimilarity matrix is available and so to conform to model requirements, it is common practice to aggregate (e.g., sum up, average) the matrices. This aggregation practice results in clustering solutions that mask the true nature of the original data. In this paper we introduce a clustering model which, to handle the heterogeneity, uses all available dissimilarity matrices and identifies for groups of individuals clustering objects in a similar way. The model is a nonconvex problem and difficult to solve exactly, and we thus introduce a Variable Neighborhood Search heuristic to provide solutions efficiently. Computational experiments and an empirical application to perception of chocolate candy show that the heuristic algorithm is efficient and that the proposed model is suited for recovering heterogeneous data. Implications for clustering researchers are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most recommender approaches focus only on the users and items to make the recommendations. However, in many applications, it is also important to incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process. Although the use of contextual information has received great focus in recent years, there is a lack of automatic methods to obtain such information for context-aware recommender systems. Some works address this problem by proposing supervised methods, which require greater human effort and whose results are not so satisfactory. In this scenario, we propose an unsupervised method to extract contextual information from web page content. Our method builds topic hierarchies from page textual content considering, besides the traditional bag-of-words, valuable information of texts as named entities and domain terms (privileged information). The topics extracted from the hierarchies are used as contextual information in context-aware recommender systems. We conducted experiments by using two data sets and two baselines: the first baseline is a recommendation system that does not use contextual information and the second baseline is a method proposed in literature to extract contextual information. The results are, in general, very good and present significant gains. In conclusion, our method has advantages and innovations:(i) it is unsupervised; (ii) it considers the context of the item (Web page), instead of the context of the user as in most of the few existing methods, which is an innovation; (iii) it uses privileged information in addition to the existing technical information from pages; and (iv) it presented good and promising empirical results. This work represents an advance in the state-of-the-art in context extraction, which means an important contribution to context-aware recommender systems, a kind of specialized and intelligent system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This potential was demonstrated through a practical application to a large mining project, showing evidence of advances in relation to current practice and identifying challenges. Data was obtained from the environmental impact study of the reviewed project and its supplements; additional data to fulfill the needs of the ESA were collected using rapid appraisal techniques. Results show that the ESA provides: (i) a more effective scoping; (ii) a contribution to delimitate the study area; (iii) a more detailed identification of impacts; (iv) a determination of significance inclusive of the perspective of affected communities; (v) a design of mitigation focused on human well-being. The challenges of using the ESA fall into two groups: the limitations inherent to the concept and those that can be overcome by furthering research and advancing practical applications. This research added evidence to previous studies showing that incorporating ecosystem services into IA can improve practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Beneficiaries; Ecosystem services approach; Environmental and social impact assessment; Iron ore; Mining; Social impacts","advance rate; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; industrial development; innovation; iron ore; minerals industry; mining industry; mitigation; research program; social impact assessment; Article; decision tree; ecosystem; environmental impact; human; mining; wellbeing; environment; research; social change; Environment; Humans; Mining; Research; Social Change",,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP: 2012/13770-6

The aim of our study was to evaluate if key polymorphisms in metabolism genes CYP1A1Msp1, GSTM1Null, GSTT1Null and DNA repair genes XRCC1Arg194Trp and hOGG1Ser326Cys could modify individual susceptibility to adverse coal exposure effects, considering the DNA damage (Comet assay) and micronucleus formation in lymphocytes (CBMN) and buccal mucosa cells (BMNCyt) as endpoints for genotoxicity. The study population is comprised of 200 healthy male subjects, 100 open-cast coal-mining workers from “El Cerrejón” (world's largest open-cast coal mine located in Guajira – Colombia) and 100 non-exposed referents from general population. The data revealed a significant increase of CBMN frequency in peripheral lymphocytes of occupationally exposed workers carrying the wild-type variant of GSTT1 (+) gene. Exposed subjects carrying GSTT1null polymorphism showed a lower micronucleus frequency compared with their positive counterparts (FR: 0.83; P = 0.04), while BMNCyt, frequency and Comet assay parameters in lymphocytes: Damage Index (DI) and percentage of DNA in the tail (Tail % DNA) were significantly higher in exposed workers with the GSTM1Null polymorphism. Other exfoliated buccal mucosa abnormalities related to cell death (Karyorrhexis and Karyolysis) were increased in GSTT/M1Null carriers. Nuclear buds were significantly higher in workers carrying the CYP1A1Msp1 (m1/m2, m2/m2) allele. Moreover, BMNCyt frequency and Comet assay parameters were significantly lower in exposed carriers of XRCC1Arg194Trp (Arg/Trp, Trp/Trp) and hOGG1Ser326Cys (Ser/Cys, Cys/Cys), thereby providing new data to the increasing evidence about the protective role of these polymorphisms. This modulation may involve specific and differentiated pathways in different tissues that also may cause a differential sensitivity related to differential induction of some enzymes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","BMNCyt; CBMN; Comet assay; Genetic polymorphism; Open-cast coal mining","coal; cytochrome P450 1A1; DNA ligase; glutathione transferase M1; glutathione transferase T1; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; XRCC1 protein; CYP1A1 protein, human; cytochrome P450 1A1; DNA binding protein; DNA glycosyltransferase; glutathione S-transferase M1; glutathione S-transferase T1; glutathione transferase; oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human; X-ray repair cross complementing protein 1; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; biotransformation; cancer risk; carcinogenic activity; cheek mucosa; coal mining; comet assay; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA repair; gene frequency; genetic polymorphism; genomic instability; genotoxicity; genotype; human; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; micronucleus; micronucleus test; mouth epithelium cell; occupational exposure; priority journal; adverse effects; case control study; coal mining; Colombia; cross-sectional study; DNA damage; DNA repair; drug inactivation; genetic association study; genetics; heterozygote; middle aged; occupational exposure; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Coal Mining; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; DNA Damage; DNA Glycosylases; DNA Repair; DNA-Binding Proteins; Genetic Association Studies; Glutathione Transferase; Heterozygote; Humans; Inactivation, Metabolic; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Young Adult",,"DNA ligase, 9015-85-4; DNA glycosyltransferase, 70356-40-0; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; CYP1A1 protein, human; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; DNA Glycosylases; DNA-Binding Proteins; glutathione S-transferase M1; glutathione S-transferase T1; Glutathione Transferase; oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human; X-ray repair cross complementing protein 1",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 300902, 470833, 303364, PRONEM 11/2070-, 10/0044-3

However, since most of these problems may depend on environments that change over time, performing classification tasks in dynamic environments has been a challenge in data mining research domain in the last decades. Currently, in the literature, the most common strategies used to detect changes are based on accuracy monitoring, which relies on previous knowledge of the data in order to identify whether or not correct classifications are provided. However, such a feedback can be infeasible in practical problems. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of current machine learning/data mining approaches proposed to deal with dynamic environments problems. The objective is to highlight the main drawbacks and open issues, as well as future directions and problems worthy of investigation.

Some classification problems are called hierarchical classification problems because they need to take into account a hierarchical taxonomy which establishes an order between involved classes. The protein's function prediction is considered a hierarchical classification problem because their functions are arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of classes. This paper presents an algorithm for hierarchical classification using the jumping emerging patterns approach. Jumping emerging patterns have been used to flat classification and in this work we explore its adoption in a hierarchical classification scenario. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in eight real datasets, compared against two other recent hierarchical classification algorithms from the literature and also with flat k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. Preliminary results showed that the proposed approach is an alternative for hierarchical classification, having as main advantages the simplicity and understandability with good accuracy. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Data Mining; Hierarchical Classification; Jumping Emerging Patterns","Data mining; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Taxonomies; Function prediction; Hierarchical classification; Hierarchical taxonomy; Jumping emerging pattern; K-nearest neighbor classification; Real data sets; Understandability; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Freitas, A.A., (2002) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery with Evolutionary Algorithms, , Secaucus, NJ, USA: Springer-Verlag New York, Inc; Freitas, A.A., Carlos, Carvalho, P.L.F., A tutorial on hierarchical classification with applications in bioinformatics (2007) Research and Trends in Data Mining Technologies and Applications, Cap., 7, pp. 175-208; Silla, C.N., Kaestner, C.A.A., Hierarchical classification of bird species using their audio recorded songs (2013) 2013 IEEE Int.

The methodology used is the automatic analysis of information through the mining of data from free software. Considering the numerous possibilities of analysis that emerged from the proposed methodology, we opted for spatial research for in-depth study. The results show that it is possible to reveal the main institutions, areas of concentration, researchers, peer relationships, among others, from a quantitative study of theses metadata and national dissertations. From another perspective, this research demonstrates that it is possible to map Brazilian science from the explicit picture in the statistical study of BDTD, revealing what in fact integrates national scientific and technological development. © 2016, Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Nowadays organizations and industries are facing the challenge of organizing, analyzing and extracting knowledge from masses of unstructured information for decision making process. The development of automatic methods to produce usable structured information from unstructured text sources is extremely valuable to them. Opposed to the traditional text classification methods that need a set of well-classified trained corpus to perform efficient classification; the ontology-based classifier benefits from the domain knowledge and provides more accuracy. In a previous work we proposed and evaluated an ontology-based heuristic algorithm [28] for occupational health control process, particularly, for the case of automatic detection of accidents from unstructured texts. Our extended proposal is more domain dependent because it uses technical terms and contrast the relevance of these technical terms into the text, so the heuristic is more accurate. It divides the problem in subtasks such as: (i) text analysis, (ii) recognition and (iii) classification of failed occupational health control, resolving accidents as text analysis, recognition and classification of failed occupational health control, resolving accidents. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Oil and gas industry; Ontology; Text classification","Accidents; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision making; Gas industry; Health; Heuristic algorithms; Industrial hygiene; Ontology; Process control; Automatic Detection; Decision making process; Oil and Gas Industry; Security application; Structured information; Text classification; Text classification methods; Textual information; Text processing",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 407851/2012-7","This work was partially funded by CNPq BJT Project 407851/2012-7 .",,"Apache OpenOffice.org, DicSin: Dicionário de sinônimos Português/Brasil (2013), http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/DicSin-Brasil; Bloehdorn, S., Hotho, A., Text classification by boosting weak learners based on terms and concepts (2004) Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM'04, pp. 331-334. , IEEE; Bodner, R.C., Song, F., Knowledge-Based Approaches to Query Expansion in Information Retrieval (1996), Springer; Borrajo, M.L., Baruque, B., Corchado, E., Bajo, J., Corchado, J.M., Hybrid neural intelligent system to predict business failure in small-to-medium-size enterprises (2011) Int.

Although many studies have been performed to determine the composition of major metabolites, including sugars and aroma compounds, no study has been undertaken yet to characterize the comprehensive metabolite composition of balsamic vinegars. Here, we present the first metabolomics study of commercial balsamic vinegars by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The combination of three GC-MS methods allowed us to detect >1500 features in vinegar samples, of which 123 metabolites were accurately identified, including 25 amino acids, 26 carboxylic acids, 13 sugars and sugar alcohols, four fatty acids, one vitamin, one tripeptide and over 47 aroma compounds. Moreover, we identified for the first time in vinegar five volatile metabolites: acetin, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-acetyl-1-pyroline, 4-anisidine and 1,3-diacetoxypropane. Therefore, we demonstrated the capability of metabolomics for detecting and identifying large number of metabolites and some of them could be used to distinguish vinegar samples based on their origin and potentially quality. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Amino acids; Aroma compounds; Fatty acids; Geographic indication; Metabolite profiling; Metabolomics; Organic acids","amino acid; balsamic vinegar; carboxylic acid; fatty acid; flavoring agent; sugar alcohol; trimethylsilyl derivative; tripeptide; unclassified drug; vinegar; vitamin; Article; cluster analysis; commercial phenomena; data mining; mass fragmentography; metabolite; metabolomics; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; vinegar, 8028-52-2",,,,,,"Greco, E., Cervellati, R., Litterio, M.L., Antioxidant capacity and total reducing power of balsamic and traditional balsamic vinegar from Modena and Reggio Emilia by conventional chemical assays (2013) Int.

The classification of texts is a natural practice of the human being and a crucial task to work with large repositories. The document clustering technique provides a logical and understandable structure that facilitates organization, navigation and search. Most clustering algorithms use the word of mouth (bag of words) model to represent a document. This model generates a high dimensionality of the data, ignores the fact that different words can have the same meaning and does not consider the relationship between them, assuming that the words are independent of each other. The proposed methodology presents the combination of a document representation model with a hierarchical document grouping method based on the frequency of co - occurrence of the concepts and a more representative labeling technique with the objective of producing a taxonomy of concepts that may reflect structure of the knowledge domain. The methodology was evaluated in a textual corpus composed of scientific documents related to the nuclear area extracted from the scientific production of the National Commission of Nuclear Energy (CNEN). The results confirmed that text mining serves as a powerful technique for managing encapsulated knowledge in large collections of documents and thus supporting the management of research activities in the area. © 2016, Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

The spatial data distribution indicated that the acid effluents favor the chemical elements leaching and transport from the tailings pile into the superficial water bodies or aquifers, modifying their quality. The acid groundwaters in both sampling periods (dry: pH 2.94–6.04; rainy: pH 3.25–6.63) were probably due to the AMD generation and infiltration, after the oxidation of sulfide minerals. Such acid effluents cause an increase of the solubilization rate of metals, mainly iron and aluminum, contributing to both groundwater and surface water contamination. Sulfate in high levels is a result of waters’ pollution due to AMD. In some cases, high sulfate and low iron contents, associated with less acidic pH values, could indicate that AMD, previously generated, is nowadays being neutralized. The chemistry of the waters affected by AMD is controlled by the pH, sulfide minerals’ oxidation, oxygen, iron content, and microbial activity. It is also influenced by seasonal variations that allow the occurrence of dissolution processes and the concentration of some chemical elements. Under the perspective of the waters’ quality evaluation, the parameters such as conductivity, dissolved sodium, and sulfate concentrations acted as AMD indicators of groundwaters and surface waters affected by acid effluents. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Acid mine drainage; Coal mine; Groundwater contamination; Iron; Sulfate; Water quality indicator","acid mine drainage; aquifer pollution; coal mining; concentration (composition); environmental indicator; groundwater; hydrogeochemistry; iron; seasonal variation; sulfate; surface water; tailings; water chemistry; water pollution; water quality; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; ground water; metal; mineral; sulfate; sulfide; water pollutant; analysis; Brazil; chemistry; coal mining; environmental monitoring; river; water pollutant; Brazil; Coal Mining; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Metals; Minerals; Rivers; Sulfates; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"sulfate, 14808-79-8; sulfide, 18496-25-8; Metals; Minerals; Sulfates; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,"Akcil, A., Koldas, S., Acid mine drainage (AMD): causes, treatment and case studies (2006) J Clean Prod, 14, pp. 1139-1145; Al-Hashimi, A., Evans, G.J., Cox, B., Aspects of the permanent storage of uranium tailings (1996) Water Air Soil Pollut, 88, pp. 83-92. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK28Xitleiu78%3D; A Situação da Produção de Carvão Mineral no Estado do Paraná em Relação a Nota Técnica 034/2011.

The use of information technology in health is crucial and is defined as the systematic application of information, computing and technology in public health areas, including surveillance, prevention, preparation and health promotion. The main applications are to promote the health of the whole population and prevention of diseases. The emphasis on disease prevention using a wide range of interventions is one aspect that makes public health, via information technology, different from other fields in the area of information science. This work explores 100 million patents in the European Patent Office base using patent2Net free software. The technological trends and opportunities for the global public health of dengue, zika and chicungunha allow to analyze the scientific and technological data of this triple threat, as well as its correlations. Opportunities for innovation and the generation of key information for managers are identified. A total of 1,975 patents and 3,177 patent families were obtained, with the highest CIP A61K classification, which provides several opportunities for medical preparations in their various forms. The publication peak occurred in 2016, with the last 10 years being the most intense in deposits granted. The largest patent holders are scientists and companies located in the USA. The location of the researchers and their holders is identified. © 2016, Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Methods: A cohort of the total working population (4 776 135 individuals; 7.2% self-employed; 18-100 years of age at baseline 2003) in Sweden with a 5-year follow-up (2004-2008) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (57 743 deaths). Self-employed individuals were categorised as sole proprietors or limited liability company (LLC) owners according to their enterprise's legal form. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare mortality rates between sole proprietors, LLC owners and paid employees, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders. Results: Mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 16% lower and from suicide 26% lower among LLC owners than among paid employees, adjusted for confounders. Within the industrial category, all-cause mortality was 13-15% lower among sole proprietors and LLC owners compared with employees in manufacturing and mining (MM) as well as personal and cultural services (PCS), and 11-20% higher in sole proprietors in trade, transport and communication and the welfare industry (W). A significant three-way interaction indicated 17-23% lower all-cause mortality among male LLC owners in MM and female sole proprietors in PCS, and 50% higher mortality in female sole proprietors in W than in employees in the same industries. Conclusions: Mortality differences between self-employed individuals and paid employees vary by the legal form of self-employment, across industries, and by gender. Differences in work environment exposures and working conditions, varying market competition across industries and gender segregation in the labour market are potential mechanisms underlying these findings. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","cohort; industry; mortality; self-employed; Sweden","adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; demography; employee; female; follow up; health status; human; major clinical study; male; manufacturing industry; mining; mortality; paid employee; priority journal; self employment; sex difference; suicide; Sweden; adolescent; cause of death; classification; comparative study; employment; epidemiology; middle aged; proportional hazards model; register; risk factor; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Sweden; Young Adult",,,,,"Health-2011/SOPHIE

This feature is often used to direct careers, manage conflicts, develop leadership, improve teaching, etc. The data generated by social media users represent user behavior facing the various situations of everyday life. With this, machine learning techniques can be used to infer the tem-perament, as is already done in the vast research on sentiment analysis and the growing research on personality prediction. This paper proposes a framework for temperament classification according to the theory of psychologist David Keirsey. Our results present an accuracy higher than 70% for the Artisan and Guardian types. © 2016 IEEE.","Machine Learn-ing; Social Data Mining; Social Media; Temperament; Text Classification","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Information science; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Machine learning techniques; Personality predictions; Psychological characteristics; Sentiment analysis; Social data mining; Social media; Temperament; Text classification; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,"Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5 (1), pp. 1-167; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, pp. 1-135; Agarwal, A., Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., Sentiment analysis of twitter data (2011) Proceedings of the Workshop on Languages in Social Media; Lima, A.C.E., De Castro, L.N., Corchado, J.M., A polarity analysis framework for twitter messages (2015) Applied Mathematics and Computation, pp. 756-767; Ortigosa, A., Martín, J.M., Carro, R.M., Sentiment analysis in facebook and its application to e-learning Computers in Human Behavior, pp. 527-541; Bermingham, A., Smeaton, A., On using twitter to monitor political sentiment and predict election results (2011) Em Sentiment Analysis Where AI Meets Psychology (SAAIP) Workshop at the International Joint Conference for Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), Chiang, , Mai, Thailand; Golbeck, J., Robles, C., Turner, K., Predicting personality with social media (2011) CHI '11 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 253-262. , 7-12 Maio; Lima, A.C., De Castro, L.N., A multi-label, semi-supervised classification approach applied to personality prediction in (2014) Neural Network, pp. 122-130; De Choudhury, M., Gamon, M., Counts, S., Horvitz, E., Predicting depression via social media (2013) ICWSM; Coppersmith, G., Harman, C., Dredze, M., Measuring post traumatic stress disorder in twitter (2014) ICWSM; Keirsey, D., (1998) Please Understand Me II: Temperament Character Intelligence, , Prometheus Nemesis Book Company; Hall, C.S., Lindzey, G., Campbell, J.B., Teorias da personalidade (2000) Porto Alegre: Artmed; Calegari, M.D.L., Gegmani, O.H., (2006) Temperamento e Carreira, , 4 ed., São Paulo: Summus; Jung, C.G., Tipos psicológicos (1921) Vozes; Komisin, M., Guinn, C., Identifying personality types using document classification methods (2012) Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference; Brinks, D., White, H., (2012) Detection of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Via Text Based Computer-Mediated Communication; Plank, B., Hovy, D., Personality traits on twitter-or-how to get 1, 500 personality tests in a week (2015) Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis; Srivastava, S., Ahuja, S., Tyagi, S., Determining keirsey temperament class of a person based on his GPS data (2013) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (IJSCE), pp. 404-408; Pennebaker, J.W., Booth, R.J., Francis, M.E., (2007) Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC2007-Operator's Manual, , Austin, Texas: LIWC. net; Hall, C.S., Lindzey, G., Campbell, J.B., Teorias da Personalidade (2000) Porto Alegre: ArtMed; Garcia, M., (2007) Jung e Os Tipos Psicológicos, , http://www.mgar.com.br/textos/Jung_e_os_tipos_psicologicos.pdf, Agosto .

The aim of this study was to use the J48 algorithm as a classification task for data from women exhibiting changes in bone densitometry. The study population included all patients treated at the diagnostic center for bone densitometry since 2010. Census sample data collection was conducted as all elements of the population were included in the sample. The service in question provides care to patients via the Brazilian Unified Health System and private plans. The results of the classification task were analyzed using the J48 algorithm, and among the dichotomized variables associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, the mean accuracy was 74.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.0-68.0) and the mean area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.64-0.66), with a mean sensitivity of 76.0 (95% CI, 76.0-76.0) and a mean specificity of 48.0 (95% CI, 46.0-49.0). The analyzed results showed higher values of sensitivity, accuracy, and curve of the ROC area in experiments conducted with individuals with osteoporosis. Most of the generated rules were consistent with the literature, and the few differences might serve as hypotheses for further studies. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA, Monsys was created to enable data mining in the virtual learning environment known as Moodle. Methods: This is an exploratory study using documentary and bibliographic research and analysis of the Monsys database. Two classes (2010 and 2011) were selected as research subjects, one with Monsys intervention and the other without. The samples were matched (using a ration of 1:1) by gender, age, marital status, graduation year, previous graduation status, location and profession. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression model with a 5 % significance level. Results: The findings show that the dropout rate in the class in which Monsys was not employed (2010) was 43.2 %. However, the dropout rate in the class of 2011, in which the tool was employed as a pedagogical team aid, was 30.6 %. After statistical adjustment, the Monsys monitoring system remained in correlation with the course completion variable (adjusted OR = 1.74, IC95% = 1.17-2.59; p = 0.005), suggesting that the use of the Monsys tool, isolated to the adjusted variables, can enhance the likelihood that students will complete the course. Using the chi-square test, a profile analysis of students revealed a higher completion rate among women (67.7 %) than men (52.2 %). Analysis of age demonstrated that students between 40 and 49 years dropped out the least (32.1 %) and, with regard to professional training, nurses have the lowest dropout rates (36.3 %). Conclusions: The use of Monsys significantly reduced the dropout, with results showing greater association between the variables denoting presence of the monitoring system and female gender. © 2016 The Author(s).","Distance learning; Dropout; Pedagogical support; Specialization","chi square test; data base; data mining; exploratory research; family health; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning environment; logistic regression analysis; male; marriage; model; monitoring; nurse; research subject; specialization; student; adult; education; family health; medical school; medical student; procedures; psychology; risk factor; school dropout; standards; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Education, Distance; Educational Measurement; Family Health; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Schools, Medical; Student Dropouts; Students, Medical",,,,,,,,"Patto, M.H.S.O., Mundo coberto de penas família e Utopia em vidas secas (2012) Estudos Avançados, 76, pp. 225-236; Souza, R.M.Q., Regime de Ciclos Com Progressão Continuada nas escolas públicas paulistas: um cenário para o estudo dos impactos das mudanças educacionais no capital cultural e habitus dos professors (2005) TEde - Sistema de Publicação Eletrônica de Teses e Dissertações, , https://sapientia.pucsp.br/handle/handle/10397, Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo Accessed 20 May 2014; Ashby, A., Monitoring student retention in the Open University: Definition, measurement, interpretation and action (2004) Open Learn, 19, pp. 65-77; Grau-Valldosera, J., Minguillón, J., Redefinindo abandono na educação on-line superior: um estudo de caso (2011) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge: Banff: ACM DL Digital Library, pp. 290-308; Grau-Valldosera, J., Minguillón, J., Redefinindo abandono na educação on-line superior: um estudo de caso (2011) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge: Banff: ACM DL Digital Library, pp. 290-308; Baxter, J., Who am in and what keeps me going?

In these kinds of markets, information is an invaluable asset. However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field, (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the main challenges and open problems in this scientific field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reports found in the literature reveal two apparent conflicting visions of how RSEs should be modeled. From one side, the Poissonian processes, of which consecutive events follow each other at a relatively regular time and should not be correlated. On the other side, the self-exciting processes, which are able to generate bursts of correlated events. The existence of many and sometimes conflicting approaches to model RSEs is a consequence of the unpredictability of the aggregated dynamics of our individual and routine activities, which sometimes show simple patterns, but sometimes results in irregular rising and falling trends. In this paper we propose a parsimonious way to characterize general RSEs, namely the Burstiness Scale (BuSca) model. BuSca views each RSE as a mix of two independent process: a Poissonian and a self-exciting one. Here we describe a fast method to extract the two parameters of BuSca that, together, gives the burstiness scale, which represents how much of the RSE is due to bursty and viral effects. We validated our method in eight diverse and large datasets containing real random series of events seen in Twitter, Yelp, e-mail conversations, Digg, and online forums. Results showed that, even using only two parameters, BuSca is able to accurately describe RSEs seen in these diverse systems, what can leverage many applications. © 2016 ACM.","Communication dynamics; Self-exciting point process; Social media","Data mining; Aggregated dynamics; Large datasets; Online forums; Parsimonious modeling; Point process; Poissonian process; Social media; Two parameter; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Barabási, A.-L., The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics (2005) Nature, 435 (7039), pp. 207-211. , may; Cao, J., Cleveland, W.S., Lin, D., Sun, D.X., (2003) Internet Traffic Tends Toward Poisson and Independent As the Load Increases, pp. 83-109; Crane, R., Sornette, D., Robust dynamic classes revealed by measuring the response function of a social system (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105 (41), pp. 15649-15653. , oct; Ferraz Costa, A., Yamaguchi, Y., Juci Machado Traina, A., Traina, C., Faloutsos, C., Rsc: Mining and modeling temporal activity in social media (2015) Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining-KDD '15, pp. 269-278. , New York, New York, USA.

Two major features distinguish data stream from batch learning: stream data are generated on the fly, possibly in a fast and variable rate; and the underlying data distribution can be non-stationary, leading to a phenomenon known as concept drift. Therefore, most of the research on data stream classification focuses on proposing effcient models that can adapt to concept drifts and maintain a stable performance over time. However, specifically for the classification task, the majority of such methods rely on the instantaneous availability of true labels for all already classified instances. This is a strong assumption that is rarely fulfilled in practical applications. Hence there is a clear need for effcient methods that can detect concept drifts in an unsupervised way. One possibility is the well-known Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a statistical hypothesis test that checks whether two samples differ. This work has two main contributions. The first one is the Incremental Kolmogorov-Smirnov algorithm that allows performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test instantly using two samples that change over time, where the change is an insertion and/or removal of an observation. Our algorithm employs a randomized tree and is able to perform the insertion and removal operations in O(logN) with high probability and calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in O(1), where N is the number of sample observations. This is a significant speed-up compared to the O(N logN) cost of the non-incremental implementation. The second contribution is the use of the Incremental Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect concept drifts without true labels. Classification algorithms adapted to use the test rely on a limited portion of those labels just to update the classification model after a concept drift is detected. © 2016 ACM.","Cartesian tree; Concept drift; Data stream; Kolmogorov-Smirnov; Lazy propagation; Treap","Forestry; Trees (mathematics); Cartesian Trees; Concept drifts; Data stream; Kolmogorov-Smirnov; Treap; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 03083/2013-1, 446330/2014-0, 2013/50379-6

However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process and is particularly useful in applications such as tweet sentiment analysis, where a large amount of unlabeled data is available. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although quite appealing, is relatively new. We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that combines unsupervised information, captured from a similarity matrix constructed from unlabeled data, with a classifier. Our motivation is that such a similarity matrix is a powerful knowledge-discovery tool that can help classify unlabeled tweet sets. Our framework makes use of the well-known Self-training algorithm to induce a better tweet sentiment classifier. Experimental results in real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve the accuracy of tweet sentiment analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Semi-supervised learning; Tweet sentiment analysis","Algorithms; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Matrix algebra; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Classification models; Labeled and unlabeled data; Real-world datasets; Semi- supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Similarity matrix; Supervised algorithm; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Wang, C., Xiao, Z., Liu, Y., Xu, Y., Zhou, A., Zhang, K., Sentiview: Sentiment analysis and visualization for internet popular topics (2013) IEEE Trans.

The strategy combines the wines’ functionality, designed as antioxidant activity (DPPH and ORAC), total polyphenols (TP), total anthocyanins (TA), and color, with a data mining technique known as support vector machines (SVM). The original dataset has 16 wine samples from Brazil and 113 from Chile. Algorithms were used to balance the dataset. Using resampling algorithms, we extended the Brazilian wines to 32 samples and reduced the Chilean wines to 32. With the proposed methodology, it was possible to classify the origin of the wine with an accuracy of 89% when using the 20 original elements.

This article presents a proposal for the education, training and certified qualification of Brazilian police officers in order to prepare them so that they can be as knowledgeable, reliable, efficient and effective as possible. The proposal presents two types of training and qualification: the first, police officers whose primary focus is not cybercrime per se, but who as first responders are likely to encounter ICT activities as part of their work in fighting cybercrime; and the second, police officers who are involved in cybercrime investigations but expected to be classified as specialists. The proposal places strong emphasis on practical hands-on exercises, crime-scene hypothetical laboratories scenarios, actual and mock case studies and workshops to highly skilled Brazilian police officers as world class investigators. To meet this target, the proposal includes an outline of the proposed syllabus and laboratory practical sessions for each level of training to evolve specialist investigators. © 2016 IEEE.","cybercrime investigators; digital forensic; Police cybercrime education & training; qualification; security","Computer crime; Crime; Data handling; Data mining; Information science; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cybercrime; Digital forensic; Exponential growth; First responders; Hands-on exercise; Information communication technology; qualification; security; Law enforcement",,,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.ponemon.org/blog/cyber-strategies-for-endpoint-defense-2014, Ponemon Institute Research Report (2014, April).

Methods based on DTW have achieved significant results in time-series data mining. The original DTW method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classification. It disregards the temporal range when finding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a specific phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classifier needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original DTW method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classification using DTW. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Dynamic programming; image sequence analysis; monitoring; pattern classification; time series","Data mining; Dynamic programming; Image processing; Land use; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Time series; Time series analysis; Image sequence analysis; Land cover classification; Land use and land cover mapping; Land-use and land cover classifications; Remote sensing images; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Time series classifications; Time series data mining; Mapping; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data mining; image classification; land cover; land use; mapping; pattern recognition; spatiotemporal analysis; time series",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 3121512014-4

A screening and risk assessment system for smear-negative PTB using artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on patient signs and symptoms is proposed. Methods: The prognostic and risk assessment models exploit a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and inspired adaptive resonance theory (iART) network. Model development considered data from 136 patients with suspected smear-negative PTB in a general hospital. Results: MLP showed higher sensitivity (100%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 78-100%) than the other techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) linear (86%; 95% CI 60-96%), multivariate logistic regression (MLR) (79%; 95% CI 53-93%), and classification and regression tree (CART) (71%; 95% CI 45-88%). MLR showed a slightly higher specificity (85%; 95% CI 59-96%) than MLP (80%; 95% CI 54-93%), SVM linear (75%, 95% CI 49-90%), and CART (65%; 95% CI 39-84%). In terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the MLP model exhibited a higher value (0.918, 95% CI 0.824-1.000) than the SVM linear (0.796, 95% CI 0.651-0.970) and MLR (0.782, 95% CI 0.663-0.960) models. The significant signs and symptoms identified in risk groups are coherent with clinical practice. Conclusions: In settings with a high prevalence of smear-negative PTB, the system can be useful for screening and also to aid clinical practice in expediting complementary tests for higher risk patients. © 2016 The Authors.","Computational intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems","adult; Article; artificial neural network; clinical practice; diagnostic accuracy; human; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; middle aged; perceptron; prevalence; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sputum smear; support vector machine; artificial neural network; devices; evaluation study; female; isolation and purification; male; mass screening; microbiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; physiology; procedures; statistical model; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Adult; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Neural Networks (Computer); ROC Curve; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary",,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ: 26.110.974/2011

Recently, companies and research groups have announced that they have been employing health software frameworks. This paper presents the design, proof-of-concept implementations and experimentation of the Health Surveillance Software Framework (HSSF). The HSSF is a framework that tackles the demand for the recommendation of surveillance information aiming at supporting preventive healthcare strategies. Examples of such strategies are the automatic recommendation of surveillance levels to patients in need of healthcare and the automatic recommendation of scientific literature that elucidates epigenetic problems related to patients. HSSF was created from two systems we developed in our previous work on health surveillance systems: the Automatic-SL and CISS systems. The Automatic-SL system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making decisions and in identifying children with developmental problems. The CISS service associates genetic and epigenetic risk factors related to chronic diseases with patient's clinical records. Towards evaluating the HSSF framework, two new systems, CISS+ and CISS-SW, were created by means of abstractions and instantiations of the framework (design and code). We show that HSSF supported the development of the two new systems given that they both recommend scientific papers using medical records as queries even though they exploit different computational technologies. In an experiment using simulated patients’ medical records, we show that CISS, CISS+, and CISS-SW systems recommended more closely related and somewhat related documents than Google, Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering recall and precision measures, CISS+ surpasses CISS-SW in terms of precision. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Biomedical informatics; Information extraction; Ontology; Recommender systems: medical records and scientific papers; Retrieval and application of biomedical knowledge and information; Reuse; Software framework","Application programs; Bioinformatics; Computer programming; Computer software reusability; Data mining; Health; Health care; Information retrieval; Monitoring; Ontology; Search engines; Biomedical informatics; Medical record; Retrieval and application of biomedical knowledge and information; Reuse; Software frameworks; Medical information systems; accuracy; Article; computer program; electronic medical record system; genetic risk; health care quality; health survey; information dissemination; medical information system; medical record; preventive medicine; priority journal; process development; recall; risk factor; system analysis; child; chronic disease; computer system; diagnosis; health status; human; software; Child; Chronic Disease; Computer Systems; Diagnosis; Health Status; Humans; Medical Records; Population Surveillance; Software",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Monitoring of ground deformations in mining structures is an important application, particularly difficult because the scene changes with time. The persistent scatterer pair (PSP) approach, recently proposed to overcome some limitations of standard persistent scatter interferometry, proved to be effective also for mine monitoring. In this work, after resuming the main ideas of the PSP method, we describe the PSP measurements obtained from high-resolution X-band COSMO-Sky Med data over a large mining area in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The outcomes demonstrate that dense and accurate ground deformation measurements can be obtained on the mining area and its structures (such as open pits, waste dumps, conveyor belts, water and tailings dams, etc.), achieving a consistent global view including also areas where field instruments are not installed.",,"Belt conveyors; Deformation; Interferometry; Open pit mining; Field instruments; Ground deformations; Ground surface movement; High resolution; Operational monitoring; Persistent scatterers; SAR interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar",,,,,,,,"Costantini, M., Falco, S., Malvarosa, F., Minati, F., Trillo, F., Vecchioli, F., Persistent scatterer pair interferometry: Approach and application to COSMO-Sky Med SAR data (2014) IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7 (7); Ferretti, A., Prati, C., Rocca, F., Permanent scatterers in SAR interferometry (2001) IEEE Trans.

Bento Goncalves, Porto Alegre, RS  CEP: 91501-970, Brazil","Nanobubbles (NBs) have interesting and peculiar properties such as high stability, longevity and high surface area per volume, leading to important applications in mining-metallurgy and environmental areas. NBs are also of interest in interfacial phenomena studies involving long-range hydrophobic attraction, microfluidics, and adsorption at hydrophobic surfaces. However, little data are available on effective generation of concentrated NBs water dispersions and on their physicochemical and interfacial properties. In this work, air was dissolved into water at pH 7 and different pressures, and a flow was depressurized through a needle valve to generate 150-200 nm (mean diameter) NBs and MBs-microbubbles (about 70 μm). Microphotographs of the NBs were taken only in the presence of blue methylene dye as the contrast medium. Main results showed that a high concentration of NBs (number per volume) was obtained by decreasing the saturation pressure and surface tension. The number of NBs, at 2.5 bar, increased from 1.0 × 108 NB mL-1 at 72.5 mN m-1 to 1.6 × 109 NB mL-1 at 49 mN m-1 (100 mg L-1 α-Terpineol). The NBs mean diameter and concentration only slightly varied within 14 days, which demonstrates the high stability of these highly concentrated NBs aqueous dispersions. Finally, after the NBs were attached to the surface of a grain of pyrite (fairly hydrophobic mineral), the NBs dramatically increased the population of MBs, which shows the enhancement of particle hydrophobicity due to NBs adhesion. The results were explained in terms of interfacial phenomena and it is believed that these tiny bubbles, dispersed in water at high concentrations, will lead to cleaner and more sustainable mineral flotation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Interfacial properties; Mineral flotation; Nanobubbles generation; Stability","Contrast media; Convergence of numerical methods; Dispersions; Flotation; Microfluidics; Minerals; Surface chemistry; Environmental areas; Hydrophobic attraction; Hydrophobic surfaces; Interfacial phenomena; Interfacial property; Mineral flotation; Nanobubbles; Particle hydrophobicity; Hydrophobicity",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Under low pressure in the past, degradation of this fragile ecosystem is growing, especially driven by gold mining activities. The REDD+ for the Guiana Shield project developed a method involving each country in data production to monitor the impact of this activity on the forest cover and freshwater at the regional level. This paper presents the data and methodology that were used to quantify the impact on the forest cover. It discusses the results of three reference years (2001, 2008 and 2014) which confirmed the alarming expansion of gold mining in the region. Furthermore, the paper shows the results of innovative methods combining the use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data on pilot sites to improve the efficiency of future monitoring.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gold; Gold mines; Monitoring; Synthetic aperture radar; Data production; French Guiana; Innovative method; Low pressures; Optical data; Regional levels; Satellite data; Tropical forest; Economic geology",,,,,,,,"Hammond, D.S., Gond, V., De Thoisy, B., Forget, P.M., DeDijn, B., Causes and consequences of a tropical forest gold rush in the Guiana Shield, South America (2007) AMBIO, 36 (8), pp. 661-670; Peterson, G.D., Heemskerk, M., Deforestation and forest regeneration following small-scale gold mining in the Amazon: The case of Suriname (2001) Environmental Conservation, 28 (2), pp. 117-126; WWF Guianas, (2012) Living Guianas Report 2012, , http://wwf.panda.org/?207255/living-guianasreport-2012, WWF Guianas, Paramaribo, Suriname.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the contamination levels of mercury (Hg) and manganese (Mn) in several rivers of the Nangaritza River basin and assess the exposure in school-aged children residing near the gold-mining zones. River water and sediment samples were collected from a highly contaminated (HEx) and a moderately contaminated (MEx) zones. Hair Mn (MnH) and urinary Hg (HgU) levels were determined in school-aged children living in both zones. High concentrations of dissolved Mn were found in river waters of the HEx zone (between 2660 and 3990 µg l−1); however, Hg levels, in general, were lower than the detection limit (DL; &lt;1.0 µg l−1). Similarly, Mn levels in sediments were also increased (3090 to 4086 µg g−1). Median values of MnH in children of the HEx and MEx zones were 5.5 and 3.4 µg g−1, respectively, whereas the median values of HgU concentrations in children living in the HEx and MEx zones were 4.4 and 0.62 µg g-creat−1, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between both biomarkers in children from the HEx and MEx zones. In addition, boys presented significantly greater MnH levels in both zones. The greater MnH values were found in children living in alluvial areas, whereas children living in the high mountain areas, where some ore-processing plants are located close to or inside houses and schools, had the greater HgU concentrations. In summary, the data reported in this paper highlights that artisanal and small-scale gold-mining activities can not only produce mercurial contamination, that can also release other heavy metals (such as Mn) that may pose a risk to human health. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"biological marker; gold; manganese; mercury; river water; water; manganese; mercury; water pollutant; biomarker; gold mine; health risk; heavy metal; manganese; mercury (element); public health; river basin; river water; Article; child; contamination; female; health hazard; human; limit of detection; male; mining; priority journal; river basin; school child; sediment; analysis; chemistry; Ecuador; environmental exposure; metabolism; mining; river; sediment; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; water pollution; Amazon Basin; Child; Ecuador; Environmental Exposure; Female; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Male; Manganese; Mercury; Mining; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",,"gold, 7440-57-5; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; water, 7732-18-5; Manganese; Mercury; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,"Adjei-Kyereme, Y., Donkor, A.K., Golow, A.A., Yeboah, P.O., Pwamang, J., Mercury concentrations in water and sediments in rivers impacted by artisanal gold mining in the Asutifi district, Ghana (2015) Res J Chem Environ Sci, 3, pp. 40-48; Agencia de Regulación y Control Minero, (2013) Informe de Gestión 2013, , Agencia de Regulación y Control Minero, Zamora; Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry, (1999) Toxicological profile for mercury, , U.

However, H.264/AVC has dominated the market for over a decade, so that there is an enormous amount of legacy content that must be migrated. This paper proposes a fast transcoder based on an extensive data mining process on H.264/AVC decoding attributes. The data mining allowed identifying relevant information from the H.264/AVC decoding process, which was conveyed to the C4.5 machine learning algorithm to build a set of decision trees that simplify the complex Coding Unit (CU) size decision in HEVC. Experimental results have shown an average reduction of 44% in the transcoding time, with a small bit rate increase of 1.67%. These results outperform any previous works available in the literature. © 2016 IEEE.","complexity reduction; data mining; H.264/AVC; HEVC; machine learning; transcoding; video coding","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Decision trees; Decoding; Forestry; Image coding; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Reconfigurable hardware; Trees (mathematics); Video signal processing; Complexity reduction; Data mining process; H.264/AVC; H.264/AVC standards; HEVC; High-efficiency video coding; State-of-the-art technology; Transcoding; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Vanne, J., Viitanen, M., Hamalainen, T., Hallapuro, A., Comparative rate-distortion-complexity analysis of HEVC and AVC video codecs (2012) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, pp. 1885-1898; Correa, G., Assuncao, P., Agostini, L., Da Silva Cruz, L.A., Performance and computational complexity assessment of high efficiency video encoders (2012) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, pp. 1899-1909; Sangsoo, A., Bumshik, L., Munchurl, K., A novel fast cu encoding scheme based on spatiotemporal encoding parameters for HEVC inter coding (2015) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 25, pp. 422-435; Vanne, J., Viitanen, M., Hamalainen, T., Efficient mode decision schemes for HEVC inter prediction (2014) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 24, pp. 1579-1593; Correa, G., Assuncao, P., Agostini, L., Da Silva Cruz, L.A., Fast HEVC encoding decisions using data mining (2015) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 25, pp. 660-673; Peixoto, E., Izquierdo, E., A complexity-scalable transcoder from H. 264/AVC to the new HEVC codec (2012) Image Processing (ICIP), 2012 19th IEEE International Conference on, pp. 737-740; Jiang, W., Chen, Y.W., Low-complexity transcoding from H. 264 to HEVC based on motion vector clustering (2013) Electronics Letters, 49, pp. 1224-1226; Peixoto, E., Shanableh, T., Izquierdo, E., H. 264/AVC to HEVC video transcoder based on dynamic thresholding and content modeling (2014) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 24, pp. 99-112; Diaz-Honrubia, A.J., Adaptive fast quadtree level decision algorithm for h. 264/HEVC video transcoding (2015) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, PP, p. 14; (2012) Common Test Conditions and Software Reference Configurations, , ISO/IEC-JCT1/SC29/WG11, ed.

Expressed as data (kinematic and dynamic measures), patients' performance were sensed and stored by a single InMotion Arm robotic device for further analysis. It was applied a Knowledge Discovery roadmap over collected data in order to preprocess, transform and perform data mining through machine learning methods. Our efforts culminated in a pattern classification with the abilty to distinguish hemiparetic sides with an accuracy rate of 94%, having 8 features of rehabilitation performance feeding the input. Interpreting the obtained feature structure, it was observed that force-related attributes are more significant to the composition of the extracted pattern. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Extraction; Learning systems; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Patient rehabilitation; Robotics; Accuracy rate; Dynamic measures; Feature structure; Hemiparesis; Machine learning methods; Performance data; Robotic devices; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Data mining",,,,,,,,"(2012) World Health Statistics, , http://www.who.int/gho/publications/worldhealthstatistics/ENWHS2012Full.pdf, WHO9 feb 2015; Horak, F.B., Assumptions underlying motor control for neurologic rehabilitation (1990) Contemporary Management of Motor Problems, pp. 11-27. , Chapter 4; Andrade, K.O., Fernandes, G., Martins, J., Jr., Roma, V.C., Joaquim, R.C., Caurin, G.A.P., Rehabilitation robotics and serious games: An initial architecture for simultaneous players Biosignals and Biorobotics Conference (BRC) 2013 ISSNIP, pp. 1-6. , Feb 2013; Bosecker, C., Dipietro, L., Volpe, B., Krebs, H.I., Kinematic robotbased evaluation scales and clinical counterparts to measure upper limb motor performance in patients with chronic stroke (2010) Neurorehabil Neural Repair, 24, pp. 62-69. , Jan; Krebs, H.I., Krams, M., Agrafiotis, D.K., DiBernardo, A., Chavez, J.C., Littman, G.S., Yang, E., Volpe, B.T., Robotic measurement of arm movements after stroke establishes biomarkers of motor recovery (2014) Stroke, 45, pp. 200-204. , Jan; Burdea, G.C., Keynote Address: Virtual rehabilitation-benefits and challenges (2002) Proceedings of 1st Intl Workshop on Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (Mental Health, Neurological, Physical, Vocational, pp. 1-11; Moretti, C.B., Andrade, K.O., Caurin, G.A.P., Physiotherapy support web-based system for rehabilitation robotics: An initial architecture (2013) 22nd.

Data mining is one of the main techniques used to extract knowledge from large amounts of data, because of its versatility. The purpose of this article is to use clustering techniques and data mining to extract relationships and knowledge from metadata in SDI. For this reason, knowledge discovery techniques, clustering, text mining and data mining algorithms were used. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study was implemented to evaluate the performance of data mining techniques in this type of database. The results showed that the data mining process and clustering techniques guided to the classification proposed method for extracting relations and knowledge from a group of metadata extracted from within the database. © 2016 AISTI.","Data Mining; Spatial Data Infrastructure; Technique of Clustering","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Information systems; Metadata; Clustering techniques; Data mining algorithm; Data mining process; Knowledge discovery techniques; Knowledge extraction; Large amounts of data; Spatial data infrastructure; Technique of Clustering; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Álvarez, J.T., (2013) Manejo de la Comunicación Organizacional, , Madrid: Díaz de Santos; Campos, F., La investigación y gestión de las redes sociales. en (2013) Revista Latina de Comunicación Social, 51, pp. 526-548. , http://www.revistalatinacs.org/068/cuadernos/cac51.pdf; Garrido, F., (2000) Comunicación Estratégica, , Barcelona: Gestión; Merino, C., Guzmán, J., Usuarios y no usuarios en el Ecuador de la red de comunicación más influyente de los últimos años: Internet. en (2011) ComHumanitas, 2, pp. 141-161; Moscol, R., Gamero, R., Aproximación a la confianza como bien interno de las Relaciones Públicas. en (2013) Revista de Comunicación, 12, pp. 110-138. , http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4508760, Recuperado de; Rivera, A., Rojas, L.R., (2005) La Comunicación Como Herramienta de Gestión Organizacional, 2, pp. 32-48. , http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/782/78212103.pdf, En Negotium.

Thus, it can define a User's Behavioral Pattern (PCU) with a particular focus of study. Therefore, this paper presents the work in progress of a doctoral dissertation that will study the time evolution of the use of AS in the publications of Facebook users' profiles. The case study is related to publications data mining of AS for physical activities (Fitness) to correlate healthy habits and physical activity, in order to predict the user healthy behavior and hence an improvement in their quality life. To do this, we are developing a data extraction tool throught an AS to Facebook, and its attractive point is the generation of competitive rankings customized by users and that can be published to your Facebook profile. Given the human competitive nature, it is expected a good spread of use of this AS, which will allow data mining to define the PCU healthy habits, where this PCU can be used to entice users to have a better quality of life and in this sense, decrease physical inactivity and risk for diseases associated with inactivity. © 2016 AISTI.","data mining;

The disease has symptoms often confused with other febrile syndromes, such as dengue, influenza and viral hepatitis. Improved diagnosis of patients with leptospirosis is very important for health professionals, epidemiological surveillance and primarily for rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment of patients. In this work, an analysis of the data mining techniques classification was performed, evaluating algorithms of the methods of Decision Tree, Classification Rules and Bayesian Classification. Of these, JRip was the model with the best performance, yielding 85% sensitivity and 81% specificity. The algorithms successfully predicted the disease and may represent a new tool to assist health professionals in the daily hospital routine, especially in endemic areas for leptospirosis, accelerating targeted treatment, and minimizing disease exacerbation and mortality. © 2016 AISTI.","Algorthms; Data Mining; Leptospirosis; Prediction","Algorithms; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Information systems; Patient treatment; Trees (mathematics); Algorthms; Bayesian classification; Classification models; Classification rules; Evaluating algorithms; Health professionals; Leptospirosis; Targeted treatment; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Hartskeerl, R., Leptospirosis: Current status and future trends (2006) Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology, 24 (4), p. 309; Reis, R.B., Ribeiro, G.S., Felzemburgh, R.D., Santana, F.S., Mohr, S., Melendez, A.X., Queiroz, A., Ko, A.I., Impact of environment and social gradient on leptospira infection in urban slums (2008) PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2 (4), p. e228; Da Saude, B.M., Guia de vigilancia epidemiologica (2009) Guia de Vigilância Epidemiologica/Ministerio da Saude, Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, 816. , Departamento de Vigilancia Epidemiologica.-7. ed.-Brasilia : Ministerio da Saude Serie A.

Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12%, achieving 89.05% in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant. © 2016 AISTI.","Bibliometric; Classification; Machine Learning; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Text Mining","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Information systems; Learning systems; Semantics; Automatic classification; Bibliometric; Classification models; Classification performance; Learning performance; Scientific publications; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text mining; Text processing",,,,,,,,"Lee, Y., An Empirical investigation into factors influencing the adoption of an e-learning system (2006) Online Information Review, 5, pp. 517-541; Gleason, M., Better communication in large courses (1986) College Teaching, 1, pp. 20-24. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/87567555.1986.10532325; Motschnig-Pitrik, R., Holzinger, A., Student-centered teaching meets new media: Concept and case study (2002) IEEE Journal of Education Technology & Society, 4, pp. 160-172; Sung, M., Mobile!IT Education (MIT.

Most existing approaches analyse the whole object trajectory rather that the current movement. Besides existing approaches for online pattern discovery are restricted to instantaneous positions.

By continuously tracking moving objects sub-trajectories at each time window, rather than just the last position, it becomes feasible to gain insight on the current behaviour, and potentially detect mobility patterns in real time. This demonstration presents a novel framework for online mobility pattern discovery in sub-trajectory data streams. Key innovations include: (i) Online discovery of mobility patterns and pattern evolution by tracking the sub-trajectories of moving objects, (ii) A novel structure, called micro-group, to represent the relationship among moving objects, and (iii) An incremental algorithm to maintain micro-groups and to capture their evolution on highly dynamic sub-trajectory data.

Most existing approaches cluster the whole trajectories offline. This allows characterizing the past movements of the objects but not current patterns. Recent approaches for online clustering of moving objects location are restricted to instantaneous positions. Subsequently, they fail to capture moving objects' behavior over time. By continuously tracking moving objects' sub-trajectories at each time window, rather than just the last position, it becomes possible to gain insight on the current behavior, and potentially detect mobility patterns in real time. In this work, we tackle the problem of discovering and maintaining the density based clusters in trajectory data streams, despite the fact that most moving objects change their position over time. We propose CUTiS, an incremental algorithm to solve this problem, while tracking the evolution of the clusters as well as the membership of the moving objects to the clusters. Our experiments were conducted on real data sets, and it shows the efficiency and the effectiveness of our method. © 2016 IEEE.","Clustering; Data Stream; Trajectory","Data communication systems; Information management; Clustering; Current behaviors; Current patterns; Data stream; Incremental algorithm; Mobility pattern; Online-clustering; Tracking moving objects; Trajectories",,,,,,,,"Ester, M., Kriegel, H., Sander, J., Wimmer, M., Xiaowei, Xu., Incremental clustering for mining in a data warehousing environment (1998) VLDB, 98, pp. 323-333; Li, Y., Han, J., Yang, J., Clustering moving objects (2004) SIGKDD, pp. 617-622; Jensen, C.S., Lin, D., Ooi, B., Continuous clustering of moving objects (2007) IEEE TKDE, 19; Tang, L., Zheng, Y., Yuan, J., Han, J., Leung, A., Hung, C., Peng, W., On discovery of traveling companions from streaming trajectories (2012) ICDE, pp. 186-197; Li, X., Ceikute, V., Jensen, C.S., Tan, K., Effective online group discovery in trajectory databases (2013) TKDE, 25, pp. 2752-2766; Nanni, M., Pedreschi, D., Time-focused clustering of trajectories of moving objects (2006) JIIS, 27, pp. 267-289; Pelekis, N., Kopanakis, I., Kotsifakos, E.E., Frentzos, E., Theodoridis, Y., Clustering uncertain trajectories (2011) KAIS, 28, pp. 117-147; Vlachos, M., Kollios, G., Gunopulos, D., Discovering similar multidimensional trajectories (2002) ICDE, pp. 673-684; Lee, J., Han, J., Li, X., Gonzalez, H., Traclass: Trajectory classification using hierarchical region-based, and trajectorybased clustering (2008) VLDB, 1, pp. 1081-1094; Lee, J., Han, J., Whang, K., Trajectory clustering: A partition-and-group framework (2007) SIGMOD, pp. 593-604; Li, X., Han, J., Lee, J., Gonzalez, H., Traffic density-based discovery of hot routes in road networks (2007) SSTD, pp. 441-459; Han, B., Liu, L., Omiecinski, E., Neat: Road network aware trajectory clustering (2012) ICDCS, pp. 142-151; Kharrat, A., Sandu Popa, I., Zeitouni, K., Faiz, S., Clustering algorithm for network constraint trajectories (2008) Headway in Spatial Data Handling, pp. 631-647. , Springer; Ester, M., Kriegel, H., Jörg, S., Xiaowei, Xu., A densitybased algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise (1996) KDD, 96, pp. 226-231; Coelho Da Silva, T., Zeitouni, K., Macêdo De, F.J.A., Casanova, M.A., On-line mobility pattern discovering using trajectory data (2016) EDBT, pp. 682-683; Frentzos, E., Gratsias, K., Pelekis, N., Theodoridis, Y., Algorithms for nearest neighbor search on moving object trajectories (2007) Geoinformatica, 11, pp. 159-193; Frentzos, E., Gratsias, K., Theodoridis, Y., Index-based most similar trajectory search (2007) ICDE, pp. 816-825; Panagiotakis, C., Pelekis, N., Kopanakis, I., Ramasso, E., Theodoridis, Y., Segmentation, and sampling of moving object trajectories based on representativeness (2012) TKDE, pp. 1328-1343; Cao, F., Ester, M., Qian, W., Zhou, A., Density-based clustering over an evolving data stream with noise (2006) SDM, 6, pp. 328-339; Chen, Y., Li, Tu., Density-based clustering for real-time stream data (2007) SIGKDD, pp. 133-142; Zheng, Y., Trajectory data mining: An overview (2015) TIST, p. 29; Li, Z., Lee, J., Li, X., Han, J., Incremental clustering for trajectories (2010) DASFAA, pp. 32-46; Zheng, Y., (2011) T-drive Trajectory Data Sample, , August; Zheng, K., Zheng, Y., Jing Yuan, N., Shang, S., On discovery of gathering patterns from trajectories (2013) ICDE, pp. 242-253; Li, Y., Han, J., Yang, J., Clustering moving objects (2004) SIGKDD, pp. 617-622; Coelho Da Silva, T., De MacÊdo, J., Casanova, M.A., Discovering frequent mobility patterns on moving object data (2014) SIGSPATIAL on MobiGIS, pp. 60-67","Da Silva, T.L.C.; Federal University of CearáBrazil; email: ticianalc@ufc.br","Jayaraman P.Wu W.Chow C.-Y.","et al.;IEEE;INESC TEC;LIAAD;University of Porto;Uporto, Faculdade de Economia","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","17th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, IEEE MDM 2016","13 June 2016 through 16 June 2016",,122846,15516245,9781509008834,,,"English","Proc.

This is because coffee fields are extremely heterogeneous in terms of spectral reflectance. This study therefore aims to contribute to the mapping of coffee crops using multispectral imagery with 23.5 m spatial resolution taken by the Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS III) instrument on board the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite system. The section of land covered by this study is a traditional coffee-producing province located in the south of the State of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Whereas the pixel mixture effect was managed using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), the classification was carried out using data mining (DM) techniques. The decision tree (DT) outcomes were evaluated using a simple and qualitative method based on the elements of photointerpretation. In total, eight land-use and land-cover (LULC) types were mapped, including three classes of coffee-growing land expressing different phenological conditions and management. These were named ‘Production Coffee’, ‘Mixed Coffee’, and ‘Old/Pruned Coffee’. The results showed that the methodology was effective for mapping LULC types, as the workflow adopted simplified image interpretation and offered improvements in the classification performance. Despite the coffee-cultivation classes having a large spectral variability, which increases the chances of classification errors, not many confusions were observed involving the three coffee classes mapped with other categories of use. This therefore shows that the method was efficient in isolating the coffee classes (with an accuracy greater than 70%) from other categories of use. Comparing the results obtained in this work with a conventional maximum-likelihood (ML) classification, the results revealed that when using the methodology described, the confusions between classes were less dispersed and an improvement of approximately 10% was observed in the mapping of the Production Coffee class. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Classification (of information);

In these situations, massive data are constantly generated at high speed and the underlying target function can change over time. The iadem family of algorithms is based on Hoeffding's and Chernoff's bounds and induces online decision trees from data streams, but is not able to handle concept drift. This study extends this family to deal with time-changing data streams. The new online algorithm, named iadem-3, performs two main actions in response to a concept drift. Firstly, it resets the variables affected by the change and maintains unbroken the structure of the tree, which allows for changes in which consecutive target functions are very similar. Secondly, it creates alternative models that replace parts of the main tree when they significantly improve the accuracy of the model, thereby rebuilding the main tree if needed. An online change detector and a non-parametric statistical test based on Hoeffding's bounds are used to guarantee this significance. A new pruning method is also incorporated in iadem-3, making sure that all split tests previously installed in decision nodes are useful. The learning model is also viewed as an ensemble of classifiers, and predictions of the main and alternative models are combined to classify unlabeled examples. iadem-3 is empirically compared with various well-known decision tree induction algorithms for concept drift detection. We empirically show that our new algorithm often reaches higher levels of accuracy with smaller decision tree models, maintaining the processing time bounded, irrespective of the number of instances processed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The technique: extracts causal relations from news stories, converts them into an event graph, removes irrelevant information, solves structure problems, and clusters the event graph by topic distribution. Finally, the paper describes a method for generating inferences from the graph based upon evidence in agricultural news stories.

In hospitals, laboratories and teleradiology companies, each physician or technician is specialized in a specific kind of diagnosis or analysis. Therefore, certain types of medical images are often forwarded to a certain physician or a certain group. This forwarding is time consuming. That is, repeatedly deciding who would be the best physician, whether he is available at a certain moment given a certain context is exhaustive and may be very inefficient. Thus, the proposed middleware has the ability to process and collect data from images analyzed by each medical staff. Based on the collected data and current clinical context, the middleware is able to infer who would be the best fit staff to receive a certain incoming medical image. © 2015 IEEE.","association rules; context-aware middleware; data mining; feature extraction; medical care; medical image; workflow organization","Association rules; Biomedical signal processing; Data mining; Diagnosis; Extraction; Feature extraction; Health care; Medical computing; Middleware; Best fit; Context aware middleware; Efficiency improvement; Image feature extractions; Teleradiology; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,"Nihei, K., Context sharing platfonn (2004) NEC Journal of Advanced Technology, 1 (3), pp. 200-204; Baldauf, M., Dustdar, S., Rosenberg, F., A survey on context-aware systems (2007) International Journal of Ad Hoc and Ubiquitous Computing, 2 (4), pp. 263-277; Truong, H.S., Dustdar, S., A survey on context-aware web service systems (2009) International Journal of Web Information Systems, 5 (1), pp. 5-31; Liang, G., Jiamong, C., Social context-aware middleware: A survey (2015) Pervasive and Mobile Computing [1574-1192], 17, pp. 207-219; Cheng, H., Min, L., Xu dong, L., Duan, H., A context-aware medical instant message middleware (2015) J.

In such cases, dimensionality reduction is essential to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality'. Although there exist algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of Big Data, unfortunately, they all fail to identify/eliminate non-linear correlations between attributes. This paper tackles the problem by exploring concepts of the Fractal Theory and massive parallel processing to present Curl-Remover, a novel dimensionality reduction technique for very large datasets. Our contributions are: Curl-Remover eliminates linear and non-linear attribute correlations as well as irrelevant ones, it is unsupervised and suits for analytical tasks in general-not only classification, it presents linear scale-up, it does not require the user to guess the number of attributes to be removed, and, it preserves the attributes' semantics. We performed experiments on synthetic and real data spanning up to 1.1 billion points and Curl-Remover outperformed a PCA-based algorithm, being up to 8% more accurate. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Data; Feature selection; Fractal Theory; Massive parallel processing; Non-linear attribute correlations","Big data; Data mining; Feature extraction; Fractals; Semantics; Curse of dimensionality; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Fractal theory; Non linear; Non-linear correlations; Parallel processing; Synthetic and real data; Large dataset",,,,,,,,"Bolon-Canedo, V., Śanchez-Marono, N., Alonso-Betanzos, A., Recent advances and emerging challenges of feature selection in the context of Big Data (2015) Knowledge-Based Syst; Cordeiro, R.L.F., Faloutsos, C., Traina, C., Jr., (2013) Data Mining in Large Sets of Complex Data; Bellman, R., (2013) Dynamic Programming, , Dover Books on C.

Common applications range from product recommendation to social networks and protein interaction. One of the main inferences in this types of networks is the guilty-by-Association method, where labeled nodes propagate their information throughout the network, towards unlabeled nodes. While there is a widely used algorithm for this context, called Belief Propagation, it lacks the necessary convergence guarantees for loopy-networks. More recently, a new alternative method was proposed, called LinBP and while it solved the convergence issue, the scalability for large graphs that do not fit memory remains a challenge. Additionally, most works that try to use BP considering large scale graphs rely on specific infrastructure such as supercomputers and computational clusters. Therefore we propose a new algorithm, that leverages state-of-The-Art asynchronous vertex-centric parallel processing techniques in conjunction with the state-of-The-Art BP alternative LinBP, to provide a scalable framework for large graph inference that runs on a single commodity machine. Our results show that our algorithm is up to 200 times faster than LinBP's SQL implementation on tested networks, while achieving the same accuracy rate. We also show that due to the asynchronous processing, our algorithm actually needs less iterations to converge when compared to LinBP when using the same parameters. Finally, we believe that our methodology highlights the yet not fully explored parallelism available on commodity machines, leaning towards a more cost-efficient computational paradigm. © 2016 IEEE.","Belief propagation; Data analysis; Graphs; Parallel processing","Cluster computing; Data flow analysis; Data mining; Data reduction; Graphic methods; Inference engines; Supercomputers; Asynchronous processing; Belief propagation; Belief propagation algorithm; Computational cluster; Computational paradigm; Graphs; Parallel processing; Product recommendation; Graph theory",,,,,,,,"Yedidia, J.S., Freeman, W.T., Weiss, Y., Understanding belief propagation and its generalizations (2003) Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the New Millennium, 8, pp. 236-239; Pearl, J., Reverend bayes on inference engines: A distributed hierarchical approach (1982) AAAI, pp. 133-136; Murphy, K.P., Weiss, Y., Jordan, M.I., Loopy belief propagation for approximate inference: An empirical study (1999) Fifteenth Conf on Uncertainty in AI, pp. 467-475; Yedidia, J.S., Freeman, W.T., Weiss, Y., Generalized belief propagation (2000) NIPS, 13, pp. 689-695; Felzenszwalb, P.F., Huttenlocher, D.P., Efficient belief propagation for early vision (2006) International Journal of Computer Vision, 70 (1), pp. 41-54; Sudderth, E.B., Ihler, A.T., Isard, M., Freeman, W., Willsky, A.S., Nonparametric belief propagation (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53 (10), pp. 95-103; Kang, U., Chau, D.H., Faloutsos, C., Mining large graphs: Algorithms, inference, and discoveries (2011) Data Engineering (ICDE) 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference On.

They are successfully applied in disciplines such as urban management and geography. The use of these techniques is suitable for the study of complex urban dynamics of post-industrial cities. The objective of this research is to empirically apply data mining techniques as a tool for metropolitan management. This paper presents a methodology developed to elucidate the dynamics of urban growth and its relationship with socioeconomic patterns in the Bogotá-Sabana region of Colombia. To analyze the evolution of growth in two time frames, various techniques are applied, including correlation, clustering, regionalization, and others. The results enable interesting patterns to be identified in urban development. A key aspect of these patterns is the high level of segregation and inequity that is apparent in the case study. Finally, the application opportunities of these tools in urban management are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Association rules; Clustering; Data mining; Metropolitan region; Urban management","cluster analysis; data mining; metropolitan area; modeling; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; Bogota; Colombia",,,,,,,,"Abdi, H., Factor rotations in factor analyses (2003) Encycl.

Diagnosis and treatment in early stages increase cure chances. The temperature of cancerous tissue is generally higher than that of healthy surrounding tissues, making thermography an option to be considered in screening strategies of this cancer type. This paper proposes a hybrid methodology for analyzing dynamic infrared thermography in order to indicate patients with risk of breast cancer, using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, which characterizes the methodology as hybrid. The dynamic infrared thermography monitors or quantitatively measures temperature changes on the examined surface, after a thermal stress. In the dynamic infrared thermography execution, a sequence of breast thermograms is generated. In the proposed methodology, this sequence is processed and analyzed by several techniques. First, the region of the breasts is segmented and the thermograms of the sequence are registered. Then, temperature time series are built and the k-means algorithm is applied on these series using various values of k. Clustering formed by k-means algorithm, for each k value, is evaluated using clustering validation indices, generating values treated as features in the classification model construction step. A data mining tool was used to solve the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem in classification tasks. Besides the classification algorithm recommended by the data mining tool, classifiers based on Bayesian networks, neural networks, decision rules and decision tree were executed on the data set used for evaluation. Test results support that the proposed analysis methodology is able to indicate patients with breast cancer. Among 39 tested classification algorithms, K-Star and Bayes Net presented 100% classification accuracy. Furthermore, among the Bayes Net, multi-layer perceptron, decision table and random forest classification algorithms, an average accuracy of 95.38% was obtained. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Breast cancer; Classification; Dynamic infrared thermography; Machine learning; Temperature time series","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Decision tables; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; Optimization; Supervised learning; Temperature measuring instruments; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Time series; Time series analysis; Tissue; Breast Cancer; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Multi layer perceptron; Random forest classification; Supervised machine learning; Data mining; Article; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; body temperature measurement; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer risk; classification algorithm; classifier; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; human; infrared photography; methodology; model; monitor; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; supervised machine learning; time series analysis; biological model; Breast Neoplasms; cluster analysis; female; task performance; thermography; Breast Neoplasms; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Models, Biological; Thermography; Time and Motion Studies",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

However, the huge amount of data produced every day in these networks makes it impractical for people to manually undertake the task. The Piegas system determines automatically the sentiments, or polarity, of tweets written in Portuguese about a topic of interest. Two main requirements directed the design and development of the system: (i) good usability and (ii) good precision in determining the sentiments expressed about the topic of interest. With the first requirement in mind, the system, developed using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, has a clean interface to enter the keywords that describe the topic of interest and to present the results in several levels of detail. To meet the second requirement, the system uses a Naïve Bayes classifier to identify the sentiments of tweets, as the literature shows that this algorithm combines a good classificatory performance and low response time. The usability of the system was assessed using well-known ergonomic criteria, with satisfactory results. The systems also presented good results in experiments conducted to measure its precision in identifying the predominant polarity of tweets related to five different topics of interest. © 2016 IEEE.","Naive Bayes classifier; opinion mining; Portuguese language; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","Classifiers; Naive Bayes classifiers; Opinion mining; Portuguese languages; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery in databases (1996) AI Mag., 17 (3), p. 37; Dave, K., Lawrence, S., Pennock, D.M., Mining the peanut gallery: Opinion extraction and semantic classification of product reviews (2003) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 519-528; Das, S., Chen, M., Yahoo! for Amazon: Extracting market sentiment from stock message boards (2001) Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Finance Association Annual Conference (APFA), 35, p. 43; Tong, R.M., An operational system for detecting and tracking opinions in on-line discussion (2001) Working Notes of the ACM SIGIR 2001 Workshop on Operational Text Classification, 1, p. 6; Feldman, R., Techniques and applications for sentiment analysis (2013) Commun ACM, 56 (4), pp. 82-89; Araújo, M., Goncalves, P., Cha, M., Benevenuto, F., Ifeel: A system that compares and combines sentiment analysis methods (2014) Proceedings of the Companion Publication of the 23rd International Onference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 75-78; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Found.

Mechanisms involved in leptospiral pathogenesis are not well understood. By data mining the genome sequences of Leptospira interrogans we have identified two proteins predicted to be surface exposed, LIC10821 and LIC10064. Immunofluorescence and proteinase K assays confirmed that the proteins are exposed. Reactivity of the recombinant proteins with human sera has shown that rLIC10821, but not rLIC10064, is recognized by antibodies in confirmed leptospirosis serum samples, suggesting its expression during infection. The rLIC10821 was able to bind laminin, in a dose-dependent fashion, and was called Lsa37 (leptospiral surface adhesin of 37 kDa). Studies with human plasma components demonstrated that rLIC10821 interacts with plasminogen (PLG) and fibrinogen (Fg). The binding of Lsa37 with PLG generates plasmin when PLG activator was added. Fibrin clotting reduction was observed in a thrombin-catalyzed reaction, when Fg was incubated with Lsa37, suggesting that this protein may interfere in the coagulation cascade during the disease. Although LIC10064 protein is more abundant than the corresponding Lsa37, binding activity with all the components tested was not detected. Thus, Lsa37 is a novel versatile adhesin that may mediate Leptospira-host interactions. © FEMS 2016. All rights reserved.

A critical consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions. Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using 28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories. Multitemporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the following years, selective logging did not always precede complete deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with low-intensity forest damage. © 2016, American Meteorological Society.

Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results. © 2016, The Author(s).","Datasets; Evaluation; Measures; Unsupervised outlier detection","Benchmarking; Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Statistics; Benchmark datasets; Datasets; Evaluation; Evaluation measures; K-nearest neighborhoods; Measures; Outlier Detection; Outlier detection algorithm; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Abe, N., Zadrozny, B., Langford J (2006) Outlier detection by active learning Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 504-509. , SIGKDD, Philadelphia; Achtert, E., Kriegel, H.P., Schubert, E., Zimek A (2013) Interactive data mining with 3D-parallel-coordinate-trees Proceedings of the ACM international conference on management of data, pp. 1009-1012. , SIGMOD, New York; Aggarwal, C.C., (2013) Outlier analysis, , Springer, Berlin; Akoglu, L., Tong, H., Koutra, D., Graph-based anomaly detection and description: a survey (2015) Data Mining Knowl Discov, 29 (3), pp. 626-688; Angiulli, F., Pizzuti, C., Fast outlier detection in high dimensional spaces.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study involving production sector workers of a pyrochlore mining company. The subjects completed the British Medical Research Council questionnaire, which is designed to evaluate respiratory symptoms, occupational exposure factors, and smoking status. In addition, they underwent pulmonary function tests with a portable spirometer. Results: The study involved 147 workers (all male). The mean age was 41.37 ± 8.71 years, and the mean duration of occupational exposure was 12.26 ± 7.09 years. We found that 33 (22.44%) of the workers had respiratory symptoms and that 26 (17.69%) showed abnormalities in the spirometry results. However, we found that the spirometry results did not correlate significantly with the presence of respiratory symptoms or with the duration of occupational exposure.

José Cristino, 77, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 20921-400, Brazil","Airborne gravity gradiometry data have been recently used in mining surveys to map the 3D geometry of ore deposits. This task can be achieved by different gravity-gradient inversion methods, many of which use a voxel-based discretization of the Earth's subsurface. To produce a unique and stable solution, an inversion method introduces particular constraints. One constraining inversion introduces a depth-weighting function in the first-order Tikhonov regularization imposing a smoothing on the density-contrast distributions that are not restricted to near-surface regions. Another gravity-gradient inversion, the method of planting anomalous densities, imposes compactness and sharp boundaries on the density-contrast distributions. We used these two inversion methods to invert the airborne gravity-gradient data over the iron-ore deposit at the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline in Quadrilátero Ferrífero (Brazil). Because these methods differ from each other in the particular constraint used, the estimated 3D density-contrast distributions reveal different geologic features of ore deposit. The depth-weighting smoothing inversion reveals variable dip directions along the strike of the retrieved iron-ore body. The planting anomalous density inversion estimates a compact iron-ore mass with a single density contrast, which reveals a variable volume of the iron ore along its strike increasing towards the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline which is the zone of maximum compression. The combination of the geologic features inferred from each estimate leads to a synergistic effect, revealing that the iron-ore deposit is strongly controlled by the Gandarela syncline. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Geophysical inversion; Gravity gradiometry; Iron ore exploration","Deposits; Iron; Iron deposits; Iron ores; Mineral exploration; Ore deposits; Ores; Airborne gravities; Anomalous densities; Geophysical inversion; Gravity gradiometry; Near surface regions; Synergistic effect; Tikhonov regularization; Weighting functions; Economic geology; airborne survey; data inversion; gravity field; iron ore; mineral exploration; ore deposit; source rock; structural geology; syncline; tectonic setting; three-dimensional modeling; Brazil; Minas Gerais; Quadrilatero Ferrifero",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Because their CaCO3 production, rhodolith beds constitute areas of interest for mining activities. On the other hand, other goods and services provided by these environments such as nurseries habitats, fishing and climate regulation remain undersized. Besides directly CaCO3 exploitation, these diverse ecosystems within the Brazilian economic exclusive zone are often covering potentially sites for oil and gas extraction. The IBAMA (Environmental Agency of the Brazilian government) have been applying the precautionary principle to deny requests for oil/gas drilling activities where rhodolith beds occur. Here, we discuss recent data about diversity associated with rhodoliths and also record the “rare” worm Nuchalosyllis cf. maiteae. More than the distribution of one only species, our finding is an emblematic example of our infancy knowledge state about diversity associated with rhodolith beds in southwestern Atlantic. We argue that these knowledge is still insufficient to subside any attempt in classify priorities areas for oil wells drilling. In addition, we claim that the precautionary principle adopted by IBAMA must prevalence until we have robust data allowing predictions concerning higher or lower biodiversity associated with rhodolith beds. © 2016 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Crustose coralline algae; Maerl; Marine diversity; Mesophotic reefs",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP

This article proposes the use of electrical tomography for definition of a geophysical signature in terms of electrical resistivity and chargeability, in an outcrop of mineralized quartz lode at the end of an inactive gold mine. One of the targets was to analyze the continuity of the mineralized body, the occurrence of new outcrops and the applicability of the method as an auxiliary tool in mineral extraction. Three parallel lines of electrical tomography in a dipole-dipole arrangement, being orthogonal to the orientation of the gold lode, were installed in an area outside the mine. The results allowed the geophysical characterization of the mineralized zone by high resistivity (above 1000Ω.m) and high chargeability (above 30mV/V). The results of the 2D inversion models were interpolated in 3D visualization models, which allowed definition of the contour surfaces for the physical parameters measured, and the morphological pattern modeling of the mineralization. The data reveal the existence of a new lode in subsurface, localized 30m to the south of the lode outcrop. The versatility of the acquisition and data processing indicate the application potential of electrical tomography as a criterion for sampling and tenor definition in ore extraction activities, since it is objective and low cost. © 2016, Escola de Minas.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10% of articles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation plan; Decision-making; Population process modelling; Reserve selection; Spatial prioritisation; Threat map; Uncertainty","biodiversity; climate change; complexity; conservation planning; ecological modeling; landscape; literature review; mapping method; prioritization; species occurrence; trade-off; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

We present a new algorithm, called TEDA-Cloud, based on the recently introduced TEDA approach to outlier detection. TEDA-Cloud is a statistical method based on the concepts of typicality and eccentricity able to group similar data observations. Instead of the traditional concept of clusters, the data is grouped in the form of granular unities called data clouds, which are structures with no pre-defined shape or set boundaries. TEDA-Cloud is a fully autonomous and self-evolving algorithm that can be used for data clustering of online data streams and applications that require real-time response. Since it is fully autonomous, TEDA-Cloud is able to ""start from scratch"" (from an empty knowledge basis), create, update and merge data clouds, in a fully autonomous manner, without requiring any user-defined parameters (e.g. number of clusters, size, radius) or previous training. Moreover, TEDA-Cloud, unlike most of the traditional statistical approaches, does not rely on a specific data distribution or on the assumption of independence of data samples. The results, obtained from multiple data sets that are very well known in literature, are very encouraging. ©2016 IEEE.","Autonomous learning; Clustering; Data streams; Eccentricity; Evolving systems; Real-time; TEDA; Typicality","Algorithms; Cluster analysis; Data communication systems; Data mining; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Autonomous learning; Clustering; Data stream; Eccentricity; Evolving systems; Real time; TEDA; Typicality; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,,"Dehariya, V., Shrivastava, S., Jain, R., Clustering of image data set using k-means and fuzzy k-means algorithms (2010) Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 386-391. , Nov; Peng, X., Zhou, C., Hepburn, D., Judd, M., Siew, W., Application of k-means method to pattern recognition in on-line cable partial discharge monitoring (2013) Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, IEEE Transactions on, 20 (3), pp. 754-761. , June; Havens, T.C., Bezdek, J.C., Leckie, C., Hall, L.O., Palaniswami, M., Fuzzy c-means algorithms for very large data (2012) IEEE T.

Most frameworks, however, do not allow users to specify how communication must take place: That element is deeply embedded into the run-time system abstractions, making changes hard to implement. In this work, we describe Wathershed-ng, our re-engineering of the Watershed system, a framework based on the filter-stream paradigm and originally focused on continuous stream processing. Like other big-data environments, Watershed provided object-oriented abstractions to express computation (filters), but the implementation of streams was a run-time system element. By isolating stream functionality into appropriate classes, combination of communication patterns and reuse of common message handling functions (like compression and blocking) become possible. The new architecture even allows the design of new communication patterns, for example, allowing users to choose MPI, TCP, or shared memory implementations of communication channels as their problem demands. Applications designed for the new interface showed reductions in code size on the order of 50% and above in some cases. The performance results also showed significant improvements, because some implementation bottlenecks were removed in the re-engineering process. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","big data; distributed systems; frameworks; watershed","Abstracting; Data handling; Data mining; Distributed parameter control systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Reengineering; Watersheds; Common messages; Communication pattern; Distributed stream processing; Distributed systems; frameworks; Performance data; Run time systems; Stream processing; Big data",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

It has provided an enormous dataset of the so-called sentiments, whose classification can take place through supervised learning. To build supervised learning models, classification algorithms require a set of representative labeled data. However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses unlabeled data to complement the information provided by the labeled data in the training process; therefore, it is particularly useful in applications including tweet sentiment analysis, where a huge quantity of unlabeled data is accessible. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although appealing, is relatively new. We provide a comprehensive survey of semi-supervised approaches applied to tweet classification. Such approaches consist of graph-based, wrapper-based, and topic-based methods. A comparative study of algorithms based on self-training, co-training, topic modeling, and distant supervision highlights their biases and sheds light on aspects that the practitioner should consider in real-world applications. © 2016 ACM.","Co-training; Self-training; Semi-supervised learning; Topic modeling; Tweet sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Data mining; Graphic methods; Surveys; Co-training; Self training; Semi- supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Supervised learning",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 303348/2013-5

This highlights the need for computational methods to determine protein functions quickly and reliably. We believe dividing a protein family into subtypes which share specific functions uncommon to the whole family reduces the function annotation problem’s complexity. Hence, this work’s purpose is to detect isofunctional subfamilies inside a family of unknown function, while identifying differentiating residues. Similarity between protein pairs according to various properties is interpreted as functional similarity evidence. Data are integrated using genetic programming and provided to a spectral clustering algorithm, which creates clusters of similar proteins. The proposed framework was applied to well-known protein families and to a family of unknown function, then compared to ASMC. Results showed our fully automated technique obtained better clusters than ASMC for two families, besides equivalent results for other two, including one whose clusters were manually defined. Clusters produced by our framework showed great correspondence with the known subfamilies, besides being more contrasting than those produced by ASMC. Additionally, for the families whose specificity determining positions are known, such residues were among those our technique considered most important to differentiate a given group. When run with the crotonase and enolase SFLD superfamilies, the results showed great agreement with this gold-standard. Best results consistently involved multiple data types, thus confirming our hypothesis that similarities according to different knowledge domains may be used as functional similarity evidence. Our main contributions are the proposed strategy for selecting and integrating data types, along with the ability to work with noisy and incomplete data; domain knowledge usage for detecting subfamilies in a family with different specificities, thus reducing the complexity of the experimental function characterization problem; and the identification of residues responsible for specificity. © 2016 Boari de Lima et al.",,"enolase; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase; protein; active sites modeling and clustering; algorithm; amino acid sequence; Article; automation; data mining; data processing; protein analysis; protein family; protein function; protein structure; spectral clustering; statistical analysis; biology; classification; cluster analysis; physiology; procedures; protein database; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein",,"enolase, 9014-08-8; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase, 9027-13-8; protein, 67254-75-5; Proteins",,,,,,"Bastard, K., Smith, A.A.T., Vergne-Vaxelaire, C., Perret, A., Zaparucha, A., Melo-Minardi, R.C., Revealing the hidden functional diversity of an enzyme family (2014) Nat Chem Biol, 10, pp. 42-49. , 10.1038/nchembio.1387, 24240508, ..;:–; Zhang, C., Kim, S.H., Overvew of structural genomics: from structure to function (2003) Curr Opin Chem Biol, 7, pp. 28-32. , 10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00015-7, 12547423, .;:–; Lee, D., Redfern, O., Orengo, C., Predicting protein function from sequence and structure (2007) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 8, pp. 995-10005. , 10.1038/nrm2281, 18037900, .;:–; Radivojac, P., Clark, W.T., Oron, T.R., Schnoes, A.M., Wittkop, T., Sokolov, A., A large-scale evaluation of computational protein function prediction (2013) Nat Methods, 10 (3), pp. 221-227. , 10.1038/nmeth.2340, 23353650, ..;():–; Galperin, M.Y., Koonin, E.V., From complete genome sequence to’complete’ understanding?

Hybridizing a CSP plant with a PV plant can increase the whole plant capacity factor by allowing thermal energy to be stored while the PV plant is in production and thus help to achieve a fully dispatchable solar electricity production system. A thermal and economic analysis of hybrid CSP+PV plants is conducted considering a range of plant capacities based on a parabolic trough plant with the addition of a PV plant for the environmental conditions of Crucero in Northern Chile, which is a hotspot for solar energy development in the country. The study considers a parametric analysis and optimization of the storage and power block sizes for the CSP plant in terms of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for varying PV plant nominal capacity. The annual production of the plants are calculated by using the Transient System Simulation program (TRNSYS), which uses a new component library developed for that purpose. The results show good agreement with other software packages as well as with actual data from currently operating CSP plants. The adopted approach helps the proper assessment of the integration of different technologies, since it uses the well-kwon modular structure of the TRNSYS. Regarding the potential for the hybrid solar-solar plants in the Atacama Desert, the high level of irradiation available in Chile can provide a competitive electricity cost, allowing to investors the access to PPA contracts with mining companies in northern Chile. Additionally, the optimization analysis shows that the northern regions of Chile present an outstanding potential for the deployment of such projects. © 2016 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía de Chile.

The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the region over which the respective coastal states hold sovereign rights for exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of natural, living or non-living, resources. The Brazilian EEZ has a rough oceanic area of 4.5 million square kilometers and is consecrated by the word ""Blue Amazon"", an area adjacent to the Brazilian mainland, which corresponds to 52% of the country's land area. Knowing the resources of such a large area is a strategic issue concerning the country's development. This work aims to determine the physical and geoacoustic properties (Vp, density, acoustic impedance) of polymetallic crusts from different areas along the Brazilian coast and to correlate with its chemical analysis. The first were measured in two different directions, parallel and orthogonal to the layering of the samples, in order to determine anisotropic effects related to the sample's framework. The correlation of the data will allow the analysis of the acoustic response of the samples to different frequencies indicating how the sample's chemical composition affects its acoustic response. Since the investigation of the seafloor is basically conducted using acoustic geophysical methods, the results of this research will allow deciding for the best procedure and technique to be used for future exploration of this resource. © 2015 IEEE.","geoacoustics; marine geology; marine geophysics; polymetallic crusts; underwater mining","Acoustic impedance; Chemical analysis; Geophysics; Submarine geology; Anisotropic effects; Chemical compositions; Exclusive economic zones; Geoacoustic properties; Geoacoustics; Geophysical methods; Marine geophysics; Polymetallic; Underwater acoustics",,,,,,,,"Motoki, A., Motoki, K.F., De Melo, D.P., Caracterizaçaõ da Morfologia Submarina da Cadeia Vitória-Trindade e Áreas Adjacentes-ES (2012) Com Base Na Batimetria Predita Do TOPO Versaõ 14. 1.

Their primary function is to allow the host immune system to be able to distinguish between self and non-self peptides-e.g. derived from invading pathogens. However, these genes have also been implicated in immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), presenting a problem to patients, clinicians and pharmaceutical companies. We have previously developed the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) that captures the allelic and haplotype frequencies for these HLA genes across many healthy populations from around the world. Here, we report the development and release of the HLA-ADR database that captures data from publications where HLA alleles and haplotypes have been associated with ADRs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug-induced liver injury). HLA-ADR was created by using data obtained through systematic review of the literature and semi-automated literature mining. The database also draws on data already present in AFND allowing users to compare and analyze allele frequencies in both ADR patients and healthy populations. The HLA-ADR database provides clinicians and researchers with a centralized resource from which to investigate immune-mediated ADRs. ©The Author(s) 2016.

This paper proposes a method to evaluate the sentiment contained in tickets for IT (Information Technology) support.IT tickets are broad in coverage (e.g. infrastructure, software), and involve errors, incidents, requests, etc. The main challenge is to automatically distinguish between factual information, which is intrinsically negative (e.g. error description), from the sentiment embedded in the description. Our approach is to automatically create a Domain Dictionary that contains terms with sentiment in the IT context, used to filter terms in ticket for sentiment analysis. We experiment and evaluate three approaches for calculating the polarity of terms in tickets. Our study was developed using 34,895 tickets from five organizations, from which we randomly selected 2,333 tickets to compose a Gold Standard. Our best results display an average precision and recall of 82.83% and 88.42%, which outperforms the compared sentiment analysis solutions. © 2016 ACM.",,"Data mining; Filtration; Open source software; Software engineering; Factual information; Gold standards; It contexts; It supports; Open source projects; Precision and recall; Sentiment analysis; Software usabilities; Open systems",,,,,,,,"Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) Proc. of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), , Valletta, Malta; Balahur, A., Steinberger, R., Kabadjov, M., Zavarella, V., Van Der Goot, E., Halkia, M., Pouliquen, B., Belyaeva, J., Sentiment analysis in the news (2010) Proc. of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2010, 10, p. 2216. , Valletta, Malta; Balahur, A., Turchi, M., Comparative experiments using supervised learning and machine translation for multilingual sentiment analysis (2014) Computer Speech & Language, 28 (1), pp. 56-75; Bollegala, D., Weir, D., Carroll, J., Cross-domain sentiment classification using a sentiment sensitive thesaurus (2013) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25 (8), pp. 1719-1731. , Aug; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Ekman, P., An argument for basic emotions (1992) Cognition & Emotion, 6 (3-4), pp. 169-200; El-Halees, A.M., Software usability evaluation using opinion mining (2014) Journal of Software, 9 (2), pp. 343-349. , Feb; Fellbaum, C., (1998) WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, , Bradford Books; Godbole, N., Srinivasaiah, M., Skiena, S., Large-scale sentiment analysis for news and blogs (2007) Proc. of the First International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM), 2; Guzman, E., Azócar, D., Li, Y., Sentiment analysis of commit comments in github: An empirical study (2014) Proc. of the 11th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories, MSR 2014, pp. 352-355. , Hyderabad, India; Guzman, E., Bruegge, B., Towards emotional awareness in software development teams (2013) Proc. of the 9th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 671-674. , New York, New York, USA, aug, ACM Press; Hu, M., Liu, B., Mining and summarizing customer reviews (2004) Proc. of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pp. 168-177. , ACM; Jongeling, R., Serebrenik, A., Choosing your weapons: On sentiment analysis tools for software engineering research (2015) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, pp. 531-535. , Bremen; Jurado, F., Rodriguez, P., Sentiment analysis in monitoring software development processes: An exploratory case study on GitHub's project issues (2015) Journal of Systems and Software, 104, pp. 82-89; Kobayashi, N., Inui, K., Matsumoto, Y., Extracting aspect-evaluation and aspect-of relations in opinion mining (2007) EMNLP-CoNLL 2007, Proc. of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, June 28-30, 2007, pp. 1065-1074. , Prague, Czech Republic; Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan & Claypool Publishers; Mohammad, S.M., Sentiment analysis: Detecting valence, emotions, and other affectual states from text (2016) Emotion Measurement, , H.

Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries. © The Author(s) 2015.

Organic foods are appreciated by customers because of their benefits to health and friendliness to the environment. However, currently, the most common way for customers to confirm that the organic food they are buying are organic is by certificates and label information, which can be fraudulent. Furthermore, it is interesting to gain insight into organic food composition and visualize which mineral components are fundamental in the differentiation of organic from conventional food. This work addresses these problems using data mining concepts and techniques in a comparative study of organic and conventional food focusing on grape juice, but the proposed methodology can be adapted and employed for analysis of other types of organic food. This article presents a data mining analysis of the elemental composition of 37 grape juice samples collected from different locations in Brazil. The elemental composition of grape juice samples was determined by inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Forty-four elements were determined in the two types of samples, namely organic and conventional grape juice. Special effort was devoted to selecting the variables (elements) that best described each type of grape juice. Predictive models based on support vector machines, neural networks and decision trees were developed to successfully differentiate organic from conventional grape juice samples. We found that, according to the F-score, Chi-square and Random Forest Importance variable selection measures, the components Na, Sn, P, K, Sm and Nd are among the most important variables in the differentiation of organic and conventional grape juice samples. Particularly, the components Na, Sn and K received first, second or third position according to at least two methods. On the other hand, all variable selection methods considered indicated that Ag, Zn, Cr, Be and Pd were among the least important variables for the differentiation of organic and conventional grape juices. SVM yielded an accuracy of 89.18%, both CART and MLP achieved an accuracy of 86.48%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of an effective vaccine against malaria, strategies for controlling the vector are the main tool for interrupting parasite transmission. Mechanisms of oogenesis and embryogenesis in anautogenous mosquitoes are mainly modulated by blood feeding. However, the expression, at the protein level, of genes involved in such mechanisms in sugar-fed females is unknown. In this work, total protein extracts of the reproductive tract of female An. aquasalis that were fed sugar were analyzed using liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry for protein identification and bioinformatic tools for data mining. We identified 922 proteins expressed in the organ, and using several databases, we attributed biological meaning for several of them. Remarkably, nine proteins involved in oogenesis were identified in females fed sugar. Putative vitellogenins, vitellogenin receptor, lipid storage droplet, transferrin, ferritin, and apolipoprotein, identified here, are proteins involved in egg development. Proteins involved in embryonic development, such as paxillin, exuperantia, several growth factors, and dorsal switch protein, were identified. Interestingly, in this study, we identified 15 peptidases of various classes such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, serine protease, cathepsin, and metalloprotease that could potentially interact with male seminal components. Here, we demonstrated that the reproductive tract of female An. aquasalis fed on sugar expresses proteins involved in oogenesis and embryonic development. These findings reveal unknown aspects of the physiology of this organ under the given nutritional conditions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anopheles aquasalis; Mass spectrometry; Oogenesis; Proteomics; Reproductive tract","aminopeptidase; apolipoprotein; carboxypeptidase; cathepsin; exuperantia; ferritin; growth factor; insect protein; metalloproteinase; paxillin; serine proteinase; sugar; transferrin; unclassified drug; vitellogenin; vitellogenin receptor; carbohydrate; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles aquasalis; Article; bioinformatics; data mining; embryo; embryo development; female; gene ontology; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; oocyte development; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; proteomics; animal; Anopheles; gene expression regulation; male; oocyte development; physiology; reproduction; Animals; Anopheles; Carbohydrates; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Oogenesis; Proteomics; Reproduction",,"aminopeptidase, 9031-94-1; carboxypeptidase, 9031-98-5; cathepsin, 9004-08-4; ferritin, 9007-73-2; metalloproteinase, 81669-70-7; paxillin, 165945-21-1; proprotein convertase 9; serine proteinase, 37259-58-8; transferrin, 82030-93-1; Carbohydrates",,,,,,"Akbari, O.S., Papathanos, P.A., Sandler, J.E., Kennedy, K., Hay, B.A., Identification of germline transcriptional regulatory elements in Aedes aegypti (2014) Sci Rep, 4, p. 3954. , PID: 24492376; Alfonso-Parra, C., Avila, F.W., Deewatthanawong, P., Sirot, L.K., Wolfner, M.F., Harrington, L.C., Synthesis, depletion and cell-type expression of a protein from the male accessory glands of the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti (2014) J Insect Physiol, 70, pp. 117-124. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhtleju7rM, PID: 25107876; Arensburger, P., Atkinson, P.W., Sequencing of Culex quinquefasciatus establishes a platform for mosquito comparative genomics (2010) Science, 330, pp. 86-88. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXht1WmtbnL, PID: 20929810; Atella, G.C., Shahabuddin, M., Differential partitioning of maternal fatty acid and phospholipid in neonate mosquito larvae (2002) J Exp Biol, 205 (23), pp. 3623-3630. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXit1Whug%3D%3D, PID: 12409488; Atella, G.C., Silva-Neto, M.A., Golodne, D.M., Arefin, S., Shahabuddin, M., Anopheles gambiae lipophorin: characterization and role in lipid transport to developing oocyte (2006) Insect Biochem Mol Biol, 36, pp. 375-386. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28XktVGhs74%3D, PID: 16651184; Attardo, G.M., Hansen, I.A., Raikhel, A.S., Nutritional regulation of vitellogenesis in mosquitoes: implications for anautogeny (2005) Insect Biochem Molec, 35, pp. 661-675. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXkt1Oisrk%3D; Bahia, A.C., Kubota, M.S., Tempone, A.J., Pinheiro, W.D., Tadei, W.P., Secundino, N.F., Traub-Cseko, Y.M., Pimenta, P.F., Anopheles aquasalis infected by Plasmodium vivax displays unique gene expression profiles when compared to other malaria vectors and plasmodia (2010) PLoS One, 5, p. e9795. , PID: 20339545; Bahia, A.C., Kubota, M.S., Tempone, A.J., Araújo, H.R., Guedes, B.A., Orfano, A.S., Tadei, W.P., Secundino, N.F., The JAK-STAT pathway controls Plasmodium vivax load in early stages of Anopheles aquasalis infection (2011) PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 5, p. e1317. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhsVyqtbfJ, PID: 22069502; Bahia, A.C., Oliveira, J.H., Kubota, M.S., Araújo, H.R., Lima, J.B., Ríos-Velasquez, C.M., Lacerda, M.V., Pimenta, P.F., The role of reactive oxygen species in Anopheles aquasalis response to Plasmodium vivax infection (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e57014. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXjsFSiu70%3D, PID: 23441231; Baldini, F., Gabrieli, P., South, A., Valim, C., Mancini, F., The interaction between a sexually transferred steroid hormone and a female protein regulates oogenesis in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (2013) PLoS Biol, 11 (10), p. e1001695. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhslags7nN, PID: 24204210; Beier, J.C., Keating, J., Githure, J.I., Macdonald, M.B., Impoinvil, D.E., Novak, R.J., Integrated vector management for malaria control (2008) Malar J, 7, p.

The main aim of this study was to obtain a digital soil map using artificial neural networks (ANN) and environmental variables that express soillandscape relationships. This study was carried out in an area of 11,072 ha located in the Barra Bonita municipality, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A soil survey was obtained from a reference area of approximately 500 ha located in the center of the area studied. With the mapping units identified together with the environmental variables elevation, slope, slope plan, slope profile, convergence index, geology and geomorphic surfaces, a supervised classification by ANN was implemented. The neural network simulator used was the Java NNS with the learning algorithm ""back propagation."" Reference points were collected for evaluating the performance of the digital map produced. The occurrence of soils in the landscape obtained in the reference area was observed in the following digital classification: medium-textured soils at the highest positions of the landscape, originating from sandstone, and clayey loam soils in the end thirds of the hillsides due to the greater presence of basalt. The variables elevation and slope were the most important factors for discriminating soil class through the ANN. An accuracy level of 82% between the reference points and the digital classification was observed. The methodology proposed allowed for a preliminary soil classification of an area not previously mapped using mapping units obtained in a reference area. © 2016, Scientia Agricola.

An important share of such increases is due to the introduction of flexible Coding Tree structures, which best configuration is decided through exhaustive tests in a rate-distortion optimization (RDO) scheme. In this work, an early termination method for the decision of such structures was designed using classification trees obtained through Data Mining techniques. The classification trees were trained using intermediate encoding results from a set of video sequences and implemented in the encoder to avoid the full RDO-based decision. An average reduction of 37 % in the HEVC encoder computational complexity was achieved when using the designed classification trees, with a negligible cost of only 0.28 % in terms of Bjontegaard Delta-rate increase. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification trees; Coding trees; Computational complexity; Data mining; Early termination; High efficiency video coding (HEVC)","Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Computational complexity; Data mining; Efficiency; Electric distortion; Image coding; Signal distortion; Signal encoding; Video signal processing; Classification trees; Coding trees; Compression rates; Early termination; Exhaustive tests; High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC); Rate distortion optimization (RDO); Video sequences; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,"Vanne, J., Viitanen, M., Hamalainen, T., Hallapuro, A., Comparative rate-distortion-complexity analysis of HEVC and AVC video codecs (2012) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, pp. 1885-1898; Correa, G., Assuncao, P., Agostini, L., da Silva Cruz, L.A., Performance and computational complexity assessment of high efficiency video encoders (2012) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, pp. 1899-1909; Sanchez, G., Corrêa, M., Noble, D., Porto, M., Bampi, S., Agostini, L., Hardware design focusing in the tradeoff cost versus quality for the H.264/AVC fractional motion estimation targeting high definition videos (2012) Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, 73, pp. 931-944; Sanchez, G., Zatt, B., Porto, M., Agostini, L., Hardware-friendly HEVC motion estimation: new algorithms and efficient VLSI designs targeting high definition videos (2015) Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, 82, pp. 135-146; Kuhn, P.M., Kuhn Peter, M., (1999) Algorithms, complexity analysis and VLSI architectures for MPEG-4 motion estimation, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Tourapis, A.M., Enhanced predictive zonal search for single and multiple frame motion estimation (2002) Electronic Imaging, 2002, pp. 1069-1079; Bossen, F., Bross, B., Suhring, K., Flynn, D., HEVC complexity and implementation analysis (2012) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 22, pp. 1685-1696; (2013) High efficiency video coding (HEVC) test model 12 (HM 12) encoder description, , ISO/IEC-JCT1/SC29/WG11, Vienna, Austria; Seunghyun, C., Munchurl, K., Fast CU splitting and pruning for suboptimal CU partitioning in HEVC Intra coding (2013) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 23, pp. 1555-1564; Correa, G., Assuncao, P., Agostini, L., Silva Cruz, L., Complexity scalability for real-time HEVC encoders (2014) Journal of Real-Time Image Processing, pp. 1-16; Jong-Hyeok, L., Fast coding algorithm based on adaptive coding depth range selection for HEVC (2012) In IEEE international conference on consumer electronics-Berlin (ICCE-Berlin), pp. 31-33; Goswami, K., Kim, B.-G., Jun, D.-S., Jung, S.-H., Choi, J., (2014), Early coding unit (cu) splitting termination algorithm for high efficiency video coding (HEVC, ETRI Journal; Jian, X., Hongliang, L., Qingbo, W., Fanman, M., A fast HEVC inter CU selection method based on pyramid motion divergence (2014) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 16, pp. 559-564; Lampert, C.H., Machine learning for video compression: Macroblock mode decision.

Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an important task for data stream, as new concepts may appear, disappear or evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems, ND must be treated as a multiclass task, in which, the known concept is composed by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work proposes MINAS, an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a multiclass task. In the initial training phase, MINAS builds a decision model based on a labeled data set. In the online phase, new examples are classified using this model, or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used later to create valid novelty patterns (NP), which are added to the current model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature, using artificial and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed algorithm. © 2015, The Author(s).","Concept evolution; Data streams; Multiclass classification; Novelty detection","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Data communication systems; Binary classification; Classification tasks; Concept evolutions; Data stream; Multi-class classification; Multi-class learning; Novelty detection; Real-life problems; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq

Arsenic concentration was generally below the detection limit (LOD &lt; 0.5 μg L−1). Thus, water ingestion may not be a significant exposure pathway to local population. Low groundwater As concentrations (&lt;1 μg L−1) are likely due to ore body structural setting, which plunges from 10° to &gt;20°, being readily covered by thick phyllites that are poor in As some hundreds of meters away from the mine. Thirty-five percent of As levels in superficial waters (&lt;0.5 to 40 μg L−1) were &gt;10 μg L−1, which is the maximum permissible value for human ingestion. The highest concentrations were found nearby mine facilities and old artisanal mining areas surrounding the mine, decreasing downstream. Undisturbed watersheds showed As concentrations close to LOD. Hydrogeochemical data stress the sorption (adsorption and co-precipitation) of As role, mainly by Fe oxyhydroxides, as a geochemical filter that retains As, attenuating its concentration in both superficial and groundwater. Such minerals are abundant in the region oxisols, sediments, and phyllites and may form stable mineral complexes with As under the pH (mostly neutral) and Eh (reduced environment) conditions found in the field. It has been demonstrated that As(III) (more toxic) and As(V) co-exist in the analyzed waters and that As(V) predominates in superficial water. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arsenic; Contamination; Drinking water; Groundwater; Risk attenuation; Superficial water","arsenic; artisanal mining; concentration (composition); drinking water; gold mine; groundwater pollution; hydrogeochemistry; ore body; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; surface water; watershed; Brazil; Minas Gerais; Paracatu; arsenic; arsenopyrite; gold; ground water; iron derivative; mineral; organoarsenic derivative; sulfide; water pollutant; analysis; Brazil; chemistry; environment; environmental monitoring; human; mining; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; water pollution; Arsenic; Arsenicals; Brazil; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gold; Groundwater; Humans; Iron Compounds; Minerals; Mining; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",,"arsenic, 7440-38-2; gold, 7440-57-5; sulfide, 18496-25-8; Arsenic; Arsenicals; arsenopyrite; Gold; Iron Compounds; Minerals; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,"www.abceram.org.br, ABC–Associação Brasileira de Cerâmica (2014; Adriano, D.C., (2001) Trace elements in terrestrial environments: biogeochemistry, bioavailability, and risks of metals, , Springer, New York; Almeida, B.S., Dardenne, N.A., Thomson, B., Brod, J.A., Guimarães, E.M., Geoquímica dos filitos carbonosos da Formação Paracatu, Depósito Morro do Ouro, Minas Gerais (2009) Geoquímica dos filitos carbonosos da Formação Paracatu, Depósito Morro do Ouro, Paracatu, Minas Gerais.

Because of these unique characteristics, the DInSAR approach has great advantages over classical geodetic monitoring systems that allow the anticipation of high-risk situations. In the past few decades, it has been successfully applied in many areas of the earth and environmental sciences. However, there have been very few applications of this approach to active open pit mines in tropical environments. In this work, the DInSAR technique was applied to detect and monitor unknown surface displacements that may be occurring in the N4W iron mine, northern Brazil. X-band data acquired from March 2012 to April 2013 during the TerraSAR-X satellite mission were utilized for this purpose. The results were checked in the field and compared to optical leveling data. Due to the consistent deformation pattern observed over a mine waste pile, Pile W, we also performed numerical modeling in order to carry out a preliminary assessment of its theoretical deformation behavior. The results show that most of the study area can be considered to be stable. The numerical modeling indicated that horizontal displacements may be occurring, and that the DInSAR technique can be used to provide an initial rapid assessment of a large-scale deformation field, which could prove to be very useful, particularly in large active mining areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","DInSAR technique; Northern Brazil; Numerical modeling; Open pit mine; Slope instability","Deformation; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Interferometry; Numerical models; Piles; Radar; Space-based radar; Surface measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Weather satellites; D-InSAR techniques; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Geodetic monitoring systems; Horizontal displacements; Large-scale deformation; Northern Brazil; Preliminary assessment; Slope instability; Open pit mining; deformation; detection method; geodetic network; numerical model; open pit mine; slope stability; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; Brazil",,,,,,,,"Amelung, F., Galloway, D.L., Bell, J.W., Zebker, H.A., Laczniak, R.J., Sensing the ups and downs of Las Vegas: InSAR reveals structural control of land subsidence and aquifer-system deformation (1999) Geology, 27 (6), pp. 483-486; Bamler, R., Hartl, P., Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (1998) Inverse Prob, 14, pp. R1-R54; Beisiegel, V.R., Bernardelli, A.L., Drummond, N.F., Ruff, A.W., Tremaine, J.W., Geologia e recursos minerais da Serra dos Carajás (1973) Revista Brasileira de Geociências, 3 (4), pp. 215-242; Bieniawski, Z.T., Engineering rock mass classifications: a complete manual for engineers and geologists in mining, civil and petroleum engineering (1989) Wiley, New York, p. 272; Plano de Manejo para Uso Múltiplo da Floresta Nacional de Carajás (2004), IBAMA, Brasília; Mapeamento Litoestrutural e Litogeomecânico da Mina N4WN; Relatório Interno-VL 070-10-E-CA-RT-03-55-00.

With precision values always above 83%, we demonstrate how both handcrafted and randomly generated unit tests can be harnessed to learn valid usage scenarios of an API.","MUTE; Specification mining; Unit tests mining","Application programming interfaces (API); Data mining; Accuracy assessment; Learning process; Mathematical method; MUTE; Specification generations; Specification mining; Unit tests; Usage scenarios; Formal specification",,,,,,,,"Ammons, G., Bodík, R., Larus, J.R., Mining specifications (2002) ACM Sigplan Notices, 37 (1), pp. 4-16; Lee, C., Chen, F., Roşu, G., Mining parametric specifications (2011) Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 591-600. , ACM; Lee, C., Jin, D., Meredith, P.O., Rosu, G., (2012) Towards Categorizing and Formalizing the Jdk Api; Pacheco, C., Ernst, M.D., Randoop: Feedbackdirected random testing for Java (2007) Companion to the 22nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-oriented Programming Systems and Applications Companion, pp. 815-816. , ACM; Pradel, M., Gross, T.R., Leveraging test generation and specification mining for automated bug detection without false positives (2012) International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE); Pradel, M., Bichsel, P., Gross, T.R., A framework for the evaluation of specification miners based on finite state machines (2010) International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM); Reger, G., Barringer, H., Rydeheard, D., A pattern-based approach to parametric specification mining (2013) Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2013 IEEE/ACM 28th International Conference on, pp. 658-663. , IEEE; Wu, Q., Liang, G., Wang, Q., Xie, T., Mei, H., Iterative mining of resource-releasing specifications (2011) Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on, pp. 233-242. , IEEE",,,"ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP)","Association for Computing Machinery","31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2016","4 April 2016 through 8 April 2016",,121991,,9781450337397,,,"English","Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975865460

In this paper we present the ClusMAM method, which proposes a new strategy for clustering large complex datasets through metric access methods. ClusMAM aims at accelerating the process of relational partitional clustering by taking advantage of the inherent node separations of metric access methods. In comparison with other methods from the literature, ClusMAM is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the competitors maintaining clustering quality. Additionally, ClusMAM exploits the datasets to find compact and coherent clusters, suggesting the number of clusters k found in the data. The method was evaluated employing synthetic and real datasets, and the behavior of the method was consistent regarding the number of distance calculations and time required for the clustering process as well. © 2016 ACM.","Complex datasets; Metric access methods; Multimedia indexing; Unsupervised clustering","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Clustering process; Complex datasets; Distance calculation; Metric access methods; Multimedia indexing; Orders of magnitude; Partitional clustering; Unsupervised clustering; Big data",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: EU 614154

One of the reasons is human beings' limitations in handling large volumes of data. A common solution for scavenging data from texts are word clouds. A word cloud illustrates word usage in a document by resizing individual words in documents proportionally to how frequently they appear. Even though word clouds are easy to understand, they are not particularly efficient, because they are static. In addition, the presented information lacks context, i.e., words are not explained and they may lead to radically erroneous interpretations. To tackle these problems we developed VCloud, a tool that allows the user to interact with word clouds, therefore allowing informative and interactive data exploration. Furthermore, our tool also allows one to compare two data sets presented as word clouds. We evaluated VCloud using real data about the evolution of gastritis research through the years. The papers indexed by Pubmed related to this medical context were selected for visualization and data analysis using VCloud. A domain expert explored these visualizations, being able to extract useful information from it. This illustrates how can VCloud be a valuable tool for visual text analytics. © 2016 ACM.","Knowledge discovery; Text-mining; Word clouds","Data visualization; Visualization; Domain experts; Interactive data exploration; Knowledge exploration; Text analytics; Text database; Text mining; Unstructured texts; Word clouds; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 440880/2013-0, 310468/2014-0","Authors would like to thank the funding from CNPq (process numbers 440880/2013-0 and 310468/2014-0).",,"Baeza-Yates, R.A., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA; Lee, B., Riche, N.H., Karlson, A.K., Carpendale, S., SparkClouds: Visualizing trends in tag clouds (2010) Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on, 16 (6), p. 1182. , 1189; Burch, M., Lohmann, S., Pompe, D., Weiskopf, D., Prefix tag clouds.

Several methods and techniques have been independently developed for this purpose in the literature. However, recent work has showed that all of them have varying degrees of coverage and prediction accuracy, with no ""silver bullet"" for all cases and scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing ensemble combination methods aimed at combining the outputs of several state-of-the-art proposals in order to maximize both goals, which sometimes can be conflicting. We focus on combining ""off-the-shelf"" methods, increasing enormously the applicability of our strategy. We tested our solutions in a very rich experimentation environment, covering thirteen widely used methods and fourteen labeled datasets from many domains, including messages from social networks, movie and product reviews, opinions and comments in news articles. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can be very successful in our goal, meaning that our proposal can produce a real and important impact in the area of sentiment classification research. © 2016 ACM.","Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social networks","Data mining; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Combination method; Experimentation environments; Labeled datasets; News articles; Prediction accuracy; Product reviews; Sentiment classification; State of the art; Social networking (online)",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

In these situations, massive data are constantly generated at high speed and their target function can change over time. The proposed method, named Fast Adaptive Stacking of Ensembles (FASE), uses a meta-classifier to combine the predictions from the base classifiers in the ensemble. FASE maintains a set of adaptive learners, in order to deal with concept drifting data. The new algorithm is able to process the input data in constant time and space computational complexity. It only receives as parameters the confidence level for the change detection mechanism and the number of base classifiers. These characteristics make FASE very suitable for learning from non-stationary data streams. We empirically compare the new algorithm with various state-of-the-art ensemble methods for learning in non-stationary data streams. We use a Naïve Bayes classifier and a Perceptron to evaluate the performance of the algorithms over real-world datasets. The experiment results show that FASE presents higher predictive accuracy in the investigated tasks, being also able to bound its computational cost. © 2016 ACM.","Concept drift; Data stream; Ensemble methods; Massive data; Non-stationary data; Online learning","Classification (of information); Metadata; Concept drifts; Data stream; Ensemble methods; Massive data; Nonstationary data; Online learning; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Baena, M., Del Campo, J., Fidalgo, R., Bifet, A., Gavaldà, R., Morales, R., Early drift detection method (2006) 4th Int.

There are multiple existing sentiment analysis methods that explore different techniques, usually relying on lexical resources or learning approaches. Despite the large interest on this theme and amount of research efforts in the field, almost all existing methods are designed to work with only English content. Most existing strategies in specific languages consist of adapting existing lexical resources, without presenting proper validations and basic baseline comparisons. In this paper, we take a different step into this field. We focus on evaluating existing efforts proposed to do language specific sentiment analysis. To do it, we evaluated twenty-one methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis proposed for English, comparing them with two language-specific methods. Based on nine language-specific datasets, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of existing multi-language approaches. Our main result suggests that simply translating the input text on a specific language to English and then using one of the existing English methods can be better than the existing language specific efforts evaluated. We also rank those implementations comparing their prediction performance and identifying the methods that acquired the best results using machine translation across different languages. As a final contribution to the research community, we release our codes and datasets. We hope our effort can help sentiment analysis to become English independent. © 2016 ACM.","Machine translation; Multiple languages; Sentiment analysis","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Sentiment analysis; Learning approach; Machine translations; Multilingual sentences; Multiple languages; Prediction performance; Products and services; Research communities; Specific languages; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Those repositories can be effectively used to extract and analyze pertinent information and derive conclusions related to the software history or its current snapshot. Objective: This work aims to investigate recent studies on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) approaches collecting evidences about software analysis goals (purpose, focus, and object of analysis), data sources, evaluation methods, tools, and how the area is evolving. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on mining software repositories by analyzing five editions of Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories - the main conference on this area. Results: MSR approaches have been used for many different goals, mainly for comprehension of defects, analysis of the contribution and behavior of developers, and software evolution comprehension. Besides, some gaps were identified with respect to their goals, focus, and data source type (e.g. lack of usage of comments to identify smells, refactoring, and issues of software quality). Regarding the evaluation method, our analysis pointed out to an extensive usage of some types of empirical evaluation. Conclusion: Studies of the MSR have focused on different goals, however there are still many research opportunities to be explored and issues associated with MSR that should be considered. © 2016 ACM.","Empirical software engineering; Mining software repository; Secondary study; Systematic mapping study","Computer software selection and evaluation; Empirical evaluations; Empirical Software Engineering; Mining software repositories; Mining software repository (MSR); Research opportunities; Secondary study; Software repositories; Systematic mapping studies; Mapping",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 458261/2014-9","This work was partially supported by CNPq Universal 2014 grant 458261/2014-9.

In order to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of each revealed surface, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was performed in acid, alkaline and saline media containing chlorides and sulphates. The Mossbauer spectroscopy was also used to elucidate the iron phases on each surface, and these results identified the delta phase on all surfaces obtained after coulometric dissolution of galvannealed steels. In the hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride solution, the outer surface richest in zinc showed the highest polarisation resistance among the surfaces obtained using coulometric stripping of galvannealed steel, and the corrosive process occurred on the electrode surface. In the alkaline solution, the inner layer showed the highest polarisation resistance among the surfaces obtained after dissolution of galvannealed steel, and the equivalent circuit fitted to the EIS data is characteristic of a corrosion of a porous layer. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Fe–Zn phases; Mossbauer spectroscopy, Galvannealed steel","Corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Coulometers; Dissolution; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrodes; Equivalent circuits; Mossbauer spectroscopy; Polarization; Spectroscopy; Zinc; Zinc chloride; Alkaline solutions; Corrosion behaviour; Electrode surfaces; Galvannealed steel; Polarisation resistances; Porous layers; Sodium chloride solution; Steel substrate; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",,,,,,,,"Bandyopadhyay, N., Jha, G., Singh, A.K., Rout, T.K., Rani, N., Corrosion behaviour of galvannealed steel sheet (2006) Surf.

Da Granja, São José dos Campos, SP  CEP 12227-010, Brazil","The semiarid region of northeastern Brazil, the Caatinga, is extremely important due to its biodiversity and endemism. Measurements of plant physiology are crucial to the calibration of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) that are currently used to simulate the responses of vegetation in face of global changes. In a field work realized in an area of preserved Caatinga forest located in Petrolina, Pernambuco, measurements of carbon assimilation (in response to light and CO2) were performed on 11 individuals of Poincianella microphylla, a native species that is abundant in this region. These data were used to calibrate the maximum carboxylation velocity (Vcmax) used in the INLAND model. The calibration techniques used were Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and data mining techniques as the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and K-MEANS. The results were compared to the UNCALIBRATED model. It was found that simulated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) reached 72% of observed GPP when using the calibrated Vcmax values, whereas the UNCALIBRATED approach accounted for 42% of observed GPP. Thus, this work shows the benefits of calibrating DGVMs using field ecophysiological measurements, especially in areas where field data is scarce or non-existent, such as in the Caatinga. © 2016, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

BOX: 303737200-000, Brazil","Diverse projects are being carried out worldwide focusing on development of more accurate soil maps and one of the most valuable sources of data are the existing soil maps. This work aimed to (i) compare two data mining tools, KnowledgeMiner and decision trees, to retrieve legacy soil data from a detailed soil map, (ii) to create and validate the predicted soil maps in the field with the objective to identify the best method for modeling and refining soil maps, (iii) extrapolating soils information to the surrounding similar areas and (iv) to assess the accuracy of this soil map. The study was carried out in Minas Gerais state, Southeastern Brazil. From a detailed soil map, information of 12 terrain attributes was retrieved from the entire polygon of each mapping unit of the map (MUP) and from a circular buffer around the sampled points (CBP). KnowledgeMiner and decision trees were employed to retrieve information per soil class and soil maps were created per method. A field validation of 20 samples was chosen by a cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube sampling scheme and the accuracy of all maps was assessed using a global index, Kappa index, and errors of omission and commission. The KnowledgeMiner MUP map had a greater accuracy than the other methods, being even more accurate than the original map, accounting for 80% of global index and a Kappa index of 0.6524. The information extracted by KnowledgeMiner provided rules for mapping the watershed surroundings with 70.97% of global index and a kappa index of 0.5586. Legacy soil data extracted by KnowledgeMiner from a detailed soil map and used to model soil class distribution outperformed decision trees, promoted improvements on the existing soil map, and allows for the creation of a low cost soil map for the surroundings of the study area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube sampling scheme; Data mining; Digital soil mapping; Fuzzy logic; Knowledge acquisition; Tropical soils","Costs; Decision trees; Forestry; Fuzzy logic; Geometry; Knowledge acquisition; Mapping; Refining; Soil surveys; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Data-mining tools; Digital soil mappings; Environmental conditions; Latin hypercube sampling; Legacy soil datum; Southeastern Brazil; Terrain attributes; Tropical soils; Data mining; accuracy assessment; data mining; digital mapping; environmental conditions; error analysis; fuzzy mathematics; index method; knowledge; map; mapping method; pedology; sampling; soil classification; terrain; tropical soil; Brazil; Minas Gerais",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 142427/2014-4

The availability of massive amounts of data and computational methods associated with the Big Data paradigm has brought hope that such systems may soon be available in routine clinical practices, which is not the case today. We focus on visual and machine learning analysis of medical data acquired with varied nanotech-based techniques and on methods for Big Data infrastructure. Because diagnosis is essentially a classification task, we address the machine learning techniques with supervised and unsupervised classification, making a critical assessment of the progress already made in the medical field and the prospects for the near future. We also advocate that successful computer-aided diagnosis requires a merge of methods and concepts from nanotechnology and Big Data analysis. © 2016 Future Medicine Ltd.","Big Data; biosensors; computer-aided diagnosis; data analysis; data visualization; healthcare; nanotechnology","biosensor; computer aided design; computer aided diagnosis; data analysis; data mining; data processing; decision making; human; information processing; machine learning; molecular recognition; nanotechnology; pattern recognition; priority journal; Review; cloud computing; computer assisted diagnosis; medical record; nanotechnology; procedures; Cloud Computing; Data Mining; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Machine Learning; Medical Records; Nanotechnology",,,,,,,,"Groves, P., Kayyali, B., Knott, D., Van Kuiken, S., (2013) The Big-data Revolution in US Health Care: Accelerating Value and Innovation., pp. 1-19; (2011) Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases-Report of the Secretary-General A/66/83, , United Nations General Assembly; Pretz, K., (2014) Better Health Care Through Data How Health Analytics Could Contain Costs and Improve Care, , http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-focus/technology-topic/better-health-care-through-data; Musen, M.A., Shahar, Y., Shortliffe, E.H., Clinical decision-support systems (2014) Biomedical Informatics, pp. 643-674. , Shortliffe EH, Cimino JJ (Eds).

In particular, trade-off studies for optimum airfoil shape design involving various objectives and design variables require the effective analysis tool to take into account a complexity between objectives and design variables. In this study, for the multiple-conflicting objectives that need to be simultaneously fulfilled, the real-coded Adaptive Range Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm code, which represents the global and stochastic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, was developed for an airfoil shape design. Furthermore, the PARSEC method reflecting geometrical properties of airfoil is adopted to generate airfoil shapes. In addition, the Self-Organizing Maps, based on the neural network, are used to visualize trade-offs of a relationship between the objective function space and the design variable space obtained by evolutionary computation. The Self-Organizing Maps that can be considered as data mining of the engineering design generate clusters of object functions and design variables as an essential role of trade-off studies. The aerodynamic data for all candidate airfoils is obtained through Computational Fluid Dynamics. Lastly, the relationship between the maximum lift coefficient and maximum lift-to-drag ratio as object functions and 12 airfoil design parameters based on the PARSEC method is investigated using the Self-Organizing Maps method. © 2016, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

Existing multilinear detection algorithms for handling N-dimensional data, where N ≥ 3, e.g., the CORe CONsistency DIAgnostic, rely on the CP decomposition which is computationally very expensive. An alternative solution is to rearrange the tensor as a matrix using the unfolding operation and then utilize the eigenvalues of the resultant matrices for CP model order selection. We propose to employ the eigenvalues associated with the unfolding along merged dimensions, namely, the multi-mode eigenvalues, as well as the n-mode eigenvalues for accurate rank detection. These multiple sets of eigenvalues are combined via the information theoretic criterion. By designing a sequential detection scheme starting from the most squared unfolded matrix, the identifiable rank is increased to the square root of the product of all dimension lengths, which renders the detection algorithm to estimate the rank that can exceed any individual dimension length. The conditions under which the proposed multilinear detection algorithm correctly detects the tensor rank are theoretically investigated and its computational efficiency and detection performance are verified. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

As consequence of this definition and knowing that data collection of noise is a usual procedure, was established as the main goal of this study to confirm that production cycles can be detected by noise measurements and with this kind of data procedures the productivity can be analysed. Noise levels were collected following law and standard procedures. Sampling occurred al continuously throughout the working cycle on a significant number of cycles. Simultaneously data were collected allowing relating the noise with the operational tasks. Data analysis was performed considering all the obtained data. The detection of noise patterns in the different tasks resulted from data analysis in each one of the octave predefined frequency bands (63 Hz to 8 KHz). It was possible to relate noise patterns and production operations for load and transport carried out by Loaders and by the Dumpers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.",,"Data handling; Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Data collection; Noise measurements; Number of cycles; Operational tasks; Production cycle; Production operations; Standard procedures; Transport operations; Open pit mining",,,,,,,,"Behar, A., Measurement of noise inside truck cabins (1981) Applied Acoustics, 14 (3), pp. 215-223; Bowden, E.E., (2005) Relating human productivity and annoyance to indoor noise criteria systems: A low frequency analysis, , ASHRAE Transactions.111: 684-92; Branco, J.C., Diogo, M.T., Baptista, J.S., Nível de PM10 vs descargas de dumpers em explorações a céu aberto (2010) SHO 2010, , Guimarães; Ferreira, C., (2012) Avaliação de riscos na reparação de moldes para vidro de embalagem, , http://hdl.handle.net/10216/65185, Dissertação apresentada para obtenção do grau de Mestre no Mestrado em Engenharia de Segurança e Higiene Ocupacionais, Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto; Ferreira, C., Branco, J.C., Baptista, J.S., Relação entre ruído e variáveis do processo de carga e transporte na indústria extractiva a céu aberto (2011) 6° Congresso Luso-Moçambicano de Engenharia, , Maputo; Matos, M.L., Análise da Exposição do Ruído na Indústria Extrativa Face à Evolução Tecnológica (2001) Estudos, Notas e Trabalhos, Instituto Geológico e Mineiro, Tomo, 43, pp. 49-55; Noweir, M., Noise exposure as related to productivity, disciplinar actions, absenteeism, and accidents among textile workers (1984) Journal of safety research, 15 (4), pp. 163-174; (3 de março de 2011).

DiVI empowers the user to understand how the measures of similarity and diversity affect their queries, as well as increases the relevance of CBIR results according to the user judgment. An overview of the image distribution in the database is shown to the user through multidimensional projection. The user interacts with the visual representation changing the projected space or the query parameters, according to his/her needs and previous knowledge. DiVI takes advantage of the users' activity to transparently reduce the semantic gap faced by CBIR systems. Empirical evaluation show that DiVI increases the precision for querying by content and also increases the applicability and acceptance of similarity with diversity in CBIR systems. © 2015 IEEE.","Content-Based Image Retrieval; Semantic Gap; Similarity With Diversity; Visual Data Mining","Content based retrieval; Data mining; Data visualization; Query processing; Search engines; Semantics; Content based image retrieval; Content based image retrieval systems; Contentbased image retrieval (CBIR) system; Empirical evaluations; Semantic gap; Similarity With Diversity; Visual data mining; Visual representations; Image retrieval",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq

However, to validate the convergence of this algorithm our proofs require the existence of uniform global bounds on the gradients of the solutions of the underlying system in terms of certain combinations of the physical parameters (such as kinematic viscosity, the size of the domain and the forcing term). Therefore our proofs cannot be applied to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations; instead we demonstrate the implementation of this algorithm, for instance, in the context of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes-α equations. This algorithm consists of introducing a nudging process through a general type of approximation interpolation operator (which is constructed from observational measurements) that synchronizes the large spatial scales of the approximate solutions with those of unknown solutions of the Navier-Stokes-α equations corresponding to these measurements. Our main result provides conditions on the finite-dimensional spatial resolution of the collected data, sufficient to guarantee that the approximating solution, which is obtained from this collected data, converges to the unknown reference solution over time. These conditions are given in terms of the physical parameters. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Among all the classification algorithms available are those based on human comprehensible representations, such as decision trees and classification rule induction. These algorithms are usually chosen by the clarity of the results obtained and the interpretability of its models. In this paper, we evaluated the six most used algorithms based on human comprehension. We conducted experiments with 28 datasets often used in the literature in different ways: using default parameters, using ExpDB parameters and using a tool based in genetic algorithm to find the best parameter combination. The results obtained have shown the strategy of combining the data from ExpDB via GA is effective in finding classification models with good accuracy. © 2015 IEEE.","Algorithm Selection; Data mining; Decision Tree; Genetic Algorithms; Parameter Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Algorithm selection; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Data mining algorithm; Experimental evaluation; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Parameter combination; Parameter optimization; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Goldschmidt, R., Passos, E., Data mining um guia prático (2005) Campus; Quinlan, J.R., Improved use of continuous attributes in c4.5 (1996) J.

In addition, those applications produce unbounded sequences of data which cannot be stored for later analysis. Although the importance of this scenario, there are still very few algorithms available in the literature to meet this task. Despite the theoretical foundation of mathematical topology for dealing with high-dimensional spaces, none of those approaches have investigated the problem of finding topologically similar projected clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Among the advantages of topology is the possibility to analyze data in a coordinate-free and noise-robust manner. In a previous research, we have shown that topologically similar clusters can be meaningful considering real-world data sets. In this paper, we extend those ideas and propose PTS, an algorithm for finding topologically similar clusters in high-dimensional data streams. The algorithm is capable of finding traditional projected clusters and then merging them according to topological features computed using persistent homology. Experiments with synthetic data streams of dimensions d=8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 confirm the ability of PTS to find topologically similar projected clusters. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Data clustering; Data streams; Persistent homology; Topological data analysis","Algorithms; Data communication systems; Data mining; Topology; Virtual reality; Curse of dimensionality; Data clustering; Data stream; High-dimensional data streams; Mathematical topologies; Persistent homology; Theoretical foundations; Topological data analysis; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; Article; mathematical analysis; noise; priority journal; Projected Topological Stream clustering algorithm; sensitivity analysis; simulation",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

We evaluated different data input scenarios to suit the object-oriented classification approach. In addition to the four spectral bands, auxiliary products such as band ratios and digital elevation models were considered. Comparisons with traditional pixelbased classifiers were also performed. The results showed that the object-based classification approach yielded a better overall accuracy, ranging from 89% to 91%, than the pixel-based classifications, which ranged from 62% to 63%. The individual classification accuracy of forest-related classes, such as young successional forest stages, benefits the object-based approach. These classes have been reported in the literature as the most difficult to map in tropical environments. The results confirm the potential of object-based classification for mapping procedures and discrimination of successional forest stages and other related land use and land cover classes in complex Atlantic rainforest environments. The methodology is suggested for further SAAPI acquisitions in order to monitor such endangered environment as well as to support National Land and Environmental Management Protocols. © 2016 Taylor and Francis.","data mining; image classification; Remote sensing; secondary forests","airborne sensing; data mining; image classification; image resolution; mapping; multispectral image; rainforest; remote sensing; secondary forest; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",,,,,,,,"Aplin, P., Smith, G.M., Introduction to object-based landscape analysis (2011) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 25, pp. 869-875; Ashish, D., McClendon, R.W., Hoogenboom, G., Land-use classification of multispectral aerial images using artificial neural networks (2009) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 30, pp. 1989-2004; Benz, U.C., Hofmann, P., Willhauck, G., Lingenfelder, I., Heynen, M., Multi-Resolution object-Oriented fuzzy analysis of remote sensing data for GIS-Ready Information (2004) ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 58, pp. 239-258; Blaschke, T., Object based image analysis for remote sensing (2010) ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65, pp. 2-16; Blaschke, T., Hay, G., Object-Oriented image analysis and scale-Space: Theory and methods for modeling and evaluating multi-Scale landscape structure (2001) International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 34, pp. 22-29; Castilho, M., Benoit, R., Sanchez-Azofeifa, A., Calvo-Aalvarado, J., Dubayah, R., LIDAR Remote sensing for secondary tropical dry forest identification (2012) Remote Sensing of Environment, 121, pp. 131-143; Cleve, C., Kelly, M., Kearns, F.R., Moritz, M., Classification of the wildland-Urban Interface: A comparison of pixel-and Object-Based classifications using high-Resolution Aerial photography (2008) Computers Environment and Urban Systems, 32, pp. 317-326; Congalton, R.G., Green, K., (1999) Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data: Principles and Practices, , New York: Lewis Publishers; Congalton, R.G., Green, K., (2009) Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data: Principles and Practices. 2nd Ed, , Boca Raton FL: CRC/Taylor & Francis; De Santiago, F.F., Kovacs, J.M., Lafrance, P., An Object-Oriented classification method for mapping mangroves in Guinea, West Africa, using multipolarized ALOS PALSAR L-Band Data (2013) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, pp. 563-586; Dean, W., A Ferro e Fogo: A História e A Devastacąõ da Mata Atlântica Brasileira 1st Ed, 1997, 484p. , Saõ Paulo: Cia. das Letras.

The non-parametric temporal data modeling can be performed according to local and global approaches. The most of the local prediction data strategies are based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) learning method. In this paper we propose a modification of the kNN algorithm for Time Series prediction. Our proposal differs from the literature by incorporating three techniques for obtaining amplitude and offset invariance, complexity invariance, and treatment of trivial matches. We evaluate the proposed method with six complexity measures, in order to verify the impact of these measures in the projection of the future values. Besides, we face our method with two Machine Learning regression algorithms. The experimental comparisons were performed using 55 data sets, which are available at the ICMC-USP Time Series Prediction Repository. Our results indicate that the developed method is competitive and the use of a complexity-invariant distance measure generally improves the predictive performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Data mining; Machine learning; Similarity-based methods; Time series prediction","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Time series; Experimental comparison; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning methods; Predictive performance; Regression algorithms; Similarity-Based Methods; Temporal data modeling; Time series prediction; Learning algorithms",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 446330/2014-0, 303083/2013-1

Opinions are important because whenever we need to take a decision, we want to know others' points of view. The interest of industry and academia in this field of study is partly due to its potential applications, such as: marketing, public relations and political campaign. Research in this field often considers English data, while data from other languages are less explored. In this work we evaluate the available resources to assist Portuguese language sentiment analysis. For doing this, we perform sentiment analysis in a data set of the accommodation sector. We compare different pos-taggers and sentiment lexicons.

Incremental learning paradigm is a promising approach for learning in a data stream setting. However, in the presence of concept drifts, outdated concepts can cause misclassifications. Although several incremental Gaussian mixture models methods have been proposed in the literature, we notice that these algorithms lack an explicit policy to discard outdated concepts. In this paper, we propose a new incremental algorithm for data stream learning based on Gaussian Mixture Models. The proposed method is compared to various algorithms widely used in the literature, and the results show that it is competitive with them in various scenarios, overcoming them in some cases. © 2015 IEEE.","concept drift; data stream; Gaussian mixture model; Incremental learning","Algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Data communication systems; Gaussian distribution; Intelligent systems; Object recognition; Classification algorithm; Concept drifts; Data stream; Gaussian Mixture Model; Gaussian mixtures; Incremental algorithm; Incremental learning; Misclassifications; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Zliobaite, I., Learning under concept drift: An overview (2009) Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University, , Lithuania, Tech.

However, some projects enforce this collaboration model even for changes made by core team developers. This potentially enhances the quality of the repository by adding an inspection step before accepting a contribution into the repository. In this context, though less frequently, the contributions may be rejected. The understanding of the factors that lead to the rejection of these internal contributions is crucial for the improvement of the ways core developers collaborate, having a direct impact on the team productivity. In this work we extract association rules from pull request data stored in software repositories in order to find factors that have influence over the decision of rejecting contributions made by core developers. In addition, we present a qualitative analysis of some cases, helping to understand the patterns that arose from the association rules. The results indicate that some key factors increase the changes of having internal contributions rejected: (i) the inexperience with pull requests, (ii) the complexity of contributions, as well as the locality of the artifacts that have been modified, and (iii) the contribution policy of the projects. © 2015 IEEE.","Association rules; Data mining; Pull request; Software engineering","Artificial intelligence; Association rules; Learning systems; Software engineering; Acceptance rate; Collaboration models; Open source projects; Pull request; Qualitative analysis; Software project; Software repositories; Team productivities; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

However, given the high label costs, dependence of an expert, limitations in data transmission or even restrictions imposed by the problem's nature, there is a large number of real-world applications in which the availability of actual labels is infinitely delayed (never available). In these cases, it is necessary the use of algorithms that does not follow the traditional process of monitoring the error rate to detect changes in data distribution and uses the most recent labeled data to update the classification model. In this paper, we propose the method MClassification to classify evolving data streams with infinitely delayed labels. Our method is inspired on the use of Micro-Cluster representation from online clustering algorithms. Considering the presence of incremental drifts, our approach uses a distance-based strategy to maintain the Micro-Clusters' positions updated. An evaluation in several synthetic and real data shows that MClassification achieves competitive accuracy results to state-of-the-art methods and adequate computational cost. The main advantage of the proposed method is the absence of critical parameters that require user's prior knowledge, as occurs with rival methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Classification; Data stream; Delayed labels; Extreme verification latency; Online clustering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data communication systems; Data mining; Learning systems; Time delay; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Data stream; Distance-based strategy; Online-clustering; State-of-the-art methods; Synthetic and real data; Verification latencies; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2013/26151-5, 2011/17698-5, 2015/07628-0","This work was funded by FAPESP awards #2011/17698-5, #2013/26151-5, and 2015/07628-0",,"Gama, J., Žliobaite, I., Bifet, A., Pechenizkiy, M., Bouchachia, A., A survey on concept drift adaptation (2014) ACM Computing Surveys, 46 (4), p. 44; Krempl, G., Žliobaite, I., Brzeziński, D., Hüllermeier, E., Last, M., Lemaire, V., Noack, T., Stefanowsky, J., Open challenges for data stream mining research (2014) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 16 (1), pp. 1-10; Silva, D.F., Souza, V.M.A., Ellis, D.P.W., Keogh, E., Batista, G.E.A.P.A., Exploring low cost laser sensors to identify flying insect species (2014) Journal of Intelligent &Robotic Systems, pp. 1-18; Souza, V.M.A., Silva, D.F., Batista, G.E.A.P.A., Classification of data streams applied to insect recognition: Initial results (2013) BRACIS, pp. 76-81; Gama, J., Medas, P., Castillo, G., Rodrigues, P., Learning with drift detection (2004) SBIA, pp. 286-295; Gao, J., Fan, W., Han, J., Philip, S.Y., A general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams with skewed distributions (2007) SDM; Tsymbal, A., (2004) The Problem of Concept Drift: Definitions and Related Work, , Tech.

The region has a wide variety of wetlands. The climate is characterized by high temperatures and strongly seasonal precipitation. There are two well defined seasons: the dry season (winter-spring) and the rainy season (summer- fall). The Araguaia River basin is dominated by plinthosoils that are found in low flat areas, poorly drained and prone to flooding, yielding wetland habitats of high plant diversity. Since the 1970s, human activities have led to reduction in both the diversity and area of wetlands. The construction of the Belém-Brasília highway and hydroelectric dams, as well as the expansion of agricultural and mining activities, have had major impacts on the region. New information The flora diversity data of the Araguaia River basin was developed through field work, herbarium research, and use of a database (Species Link). The resulting checklist of 162 aquatic and marshy monocotyledons from the Araguaia River basin represents 20 families and 50 genera. Cyperaceae (51 spp.), Poaceae (39 spp.), and Eriocaulaceae (16 spp.) are the most representative families. Life form analysis indicates that helophytes predominate (98 spp.; 60.5%). One hundred one species are native to tropical and/or subtropical America and twenty one are endemic to Brazil. Ninety-three species are new occurrences for the Araguaia River basin. Among them, three species are reported in the Brazilian Cerrado for the first time. This work contributes to the understanding of aquatic plant diversity in the Cerrado and other savanna-like vegetation physiognomies; environments and habitats poorly understood taxonomically and undercollected generally. © Oliveira A, Bove C.","Aquatic plants; Brazilian savannah; Central Brazil flora; Lilianae",,,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: PROTAX 562251/2010-3

In such cases, we are dealing with distributed data mining problems, in which local models must be individually built and later combined into a consensus, global model. In this paper, we are particularly interested in distributed classification tasks with vertically partitioned data, i.e., when features are distributed among several sources. This restriction implies a challenging scenario given that the development of an accurate model usually requires access to all the features that are relevant for classification. To deal with such a situation, we propose an agent-based classification system, in which the preference orderings of each agent regarding the probability of an instance to belong to the target class are aggregated by means of social choice functions. We employ this method to classify microRNA target genes, an important bioinformatics problem, showing that the predictions derived from the social choice tend to outperform local models in this application. This performance gain is accompanied by other interesting advantages: the aggregation methods herein proposed are extremely simple, do not require transfer of large volumes of data, do not assume an offline training process or parameters setup, and preserve data privacy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Trabalhdor Sãocarlense, 400, São Carlos, SP, 13560-970, Brazil","A large number of compiler optimizations are nowadays available to users. These optimizations interact with each other and with the input code in several and complex ways. The sequence of application of optimization passes can have a significant impact on the performance achieved. The effect of the optimizations is both platform and application dependent. The exhaustive exploration of all viable sequences of compiler optimizations for a given code fragment is not feasible. As this exploration is a complex and time-consuming task, several researchers have focused on Design Space Exploration (DSE) strategies both to select optimization sequences to improve the performance of each function of the application and to reduce the exploration time. In this article, we present a DSE scheme based on a clustering approach for grouping functions with similarities and exploration of a reduced search space resulting from the combination of optimizations previously suggested for the functions in each group. The identification of similarities between functions uses a data mining method that is applied to a symbolic code representation. The data mining process combines three algorithms to generate clusters: The Normalized Compression Distance, the Neighbor Joining, and a new ambiguity-based clustering algorithm. Our experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach address the exploration of optimization sequences in the context of the ReflectC compiler, considering 49 compilation passes while targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, and aiming at performance improvements for 51 functions and four applications. Experimental results reveal that the use of our clustering-based DSE approach achieves a significant reduction in the total exploration time of the search space (20× over a Genetic Algorithm approach) at the same time that considerable performance speedups (41% over the baseline) were obtained using the optimized codes. Additional experiments were performed considering the LLVM compiler, considering 124 compilation passes, and targeting a LEON3 processor. The results show that our approach achieved geometricmean speedups of 1.49×, 1.32×, and 1.24× for the best 10, 20, and 30 functions, respectively, and a global improvement of 7% over the performance obtained when compiling with -O2.","Clustering; Design space exploration; Phase-ordering problem","Codes (symbols); Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Program compilers; Space time codes; Systems analysis; Additional experiments; Clustering; Combination of optimizations; Compiler optimizations; Design space exploration; Genetic algorithm approach; Normalized compression distance; Phase Ordering; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES: 0352/13-6

The monitoring of such flows is performed either in field applications or in pilot plant studies. In both cases, simple and robust measuring techniques are required. Capacitive probes have been applied for void fraction measurement in pipes in research and industry. However, capacitive measuring systems applied so far are tailored for specific applications and may not be easily adaptable. In addition, more and more soft-computing methods are applied for advanced data processing and parameter extraction which requires more computational power of sensor systems for online data processing. We develop a capacitive system provided with a microcontroller in which necessary routines for data processing may be embedded. System design is detailed explained and system's performance is evaluated, showing appropriate accuracy and time response for the investigation of two-phase flows. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacitance measurement; Capacitive probe; Microcontroller; Two-phase flow; Void fraction","Capacitance measurement; Data handling; Data mining; Industrial research; Interactive computer systems; Microcontrollers; Online systems; Parameter extraction; Pilot plants; Probes; Soft computing; Void fraction; Advanced data processing; Capacitive probe; Measuring technique; Oil and gas production; Online data processing; Soft computing methods; System's performance; Void fraction measurement; Two phase flow",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

This development has motivated the advancement of research in fault detection, especially based on process history data. Although a large amount of work has been conducted in recent years on the diagnostics of gas turbines, few of them present the use of clustering approaches applied to multivariate time series, adopting PCA similarity factor (SPCA) in order to detect and/or prevent failures. This paper presents a comprehensive method for pattern recognition associated to fault prediction in gas turbines using time series mining techniques. Algorithms comprising appropriate similarity metrics, subsequence matching and fuzzy clustering were applied on data extracted from a Plant Information Management System (PIMS) represented by multivariate time series. A real case study comprising the fault detection in a gas turbine was investigated. The results suggest the existence of a safe way to start the turbine that can be useful to support the development of a dynamic system for monitoring and predicting the probability of failure and for decision-making at operational level. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, natural gas mass flow rate is calculated by employing an Ultrasonic Flow Meter (UFM), and a volume corrector to convert the given value to its equivalent in standard conditions. As online measurement of natural gas compositions is a costly and difficult task, this study presents an innovative method for natural gas mass flow metering in CGSs. In this method, a novel correlation, which is a functional of only three simple measurable variables i.e. temperature, pressure and sound speed, is presented for calculating natural gas molecular weight, and then, employing the authentic equations of state (EOS) of AGA8 for natural gas, its density could be calculated. The correlation was developed based on curve fitting and data mining approaches on a large database associated with four different natural gas fields of Iran and its accuracy was validated with available experimental data for seven other Iran's natural gas fields and two more gases with sample compositions. Each database in correlation development and validation stage (13 databases altogether) consists of 17,000 sound speed values in all possible temperature and pressure ranges in CGSs after expansion process. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) methods are used to validate the correlation accuracy and compare its performance with the correlation presented previously for the same objective. The evaluation results prove high prediction accuracy for the presented correlation and its superiority comparing to the previous work. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CGS; Molecular weight; Natural gas mass flow meter; Sound speed; Ultrasonic flow meter","Curve fitting; Data mining; Database systems; Density of gases; Equations of state; Equations of state of gases; Flow measurement; Flowmeters; Gas industry; Gases; Mass transfer; Molecular weight; Natural gas; Ultrasonic flowmeters; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Experimental facilities; Gas mass flow; Mean absolute percentage error; Measurable variables; Natural gas composition; Sound speed; Standard conditions; Temperature and pressures; Natural gas fields",,,,,,"This work has been supported by Shahrood University of Technology grants.",,"(1992) AGA8, Compressibility and Super Compressibility Gas and Other Hydrocarbon Gases, , Transmission Measurement Committee Report No. 8, AGA Catalogue No. XQ 1285, Arlington, VA; AlQuraishi, A.A., Shokir, E.M., Viscosity and density correlations for hydrocarbon gases and pure and impure gas mixtures (2009) Pet.

Several algorithms to perform transductive classification considering text collections represented in a vector space model have been proposed. However, the use of these algorithms is unfeasible in practical applications due to the independence assumption among instances or terms and the drawbacks of these algorithms. Network-based algorithms come up to avoid the drawbacks of the algorithms based on vector space model and to improve transductive classification. Networks are mostly used for label propagation, in which some labeled objects propagate their labels to other objects through the network connections. Bipartite networks are useful to represent text collections as networks and perform label propagation. The generation of this type of network avoids requirements such as collections with hyperlinks or citations, computation of similarities among all texts in the collection, as well as the setup of a number of parameters. In a bipartite heterogeneous network, objects correspond to documents and terms, and the connections are given by the occurrences of terms in documents. The label propagation is performed from documents to terms and then from terms to documents iteratively. Nevertheless, instead of using terms just as means of label propagation, in this article we propose the use of the bipartite network structure to define the relevance scores of terms for classes through an optimization process and then propagate these relevance scores to define labels for unlabeled documents. The new document labels are used to redefine the relevance scores of terms which consequently redefine the labels of unlabeled documents in an iterative process. We demonstrated that the proposed approach surpasses the algorithms for transductive classification based on vector space model or networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed algorithm effectively makes use of unlabeled documents to improve classification and it is faster than other transductive algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Mining images is an alternative for explore large database of remote sensing images, which are methods to discover patterns in the image repository. The multi-agent systems have features that, properly implemented, can bring significant improvements in analysis of satellite images. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present the AgentGeo, a multi-agent system of satellite image mining capable of performing the classification process with multiple images at a time. The AgentGeo implements functions such as creation, edition and selection of agents, selection and creation of the environment and use of agents mining to mine the satellite imagery. This system was developed in Java and uses features from TerraView and GeoDMA. The results of the classification process were satisfactory once the developed agents had an accuracy better than 90% when compared to Google Maps images. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","AgentGeo; Agents Mining; Mining Images; Multi-agent system","Distributed computer systems; Image classification; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Intelligent agents; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; AgentGeo; Automated analysis; Classification process; Image repository; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing images; Satellite images; Tools and techniques; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,,"Moreira, F.D.L., Kleinberg, M.N., Arruda, H.F., Freitas, F.N.C., Parente, M.M.V., Albuquerque, V.H.C., Rebouças Filho, P.P., A novel Vickers hardness measurement technique based on Adaptive Balloon Active Contour Method (2016) Expert Systems with Applications, 45, pp. 294-306; Peixoto, F.M., Rebouças, E.S., Xavier, F.G.L., Rebouças Filho, P.P., Desenvolvimento de um software para cálculo da densidade de nódulos de grafita em ferro fundido nodular através de processamento digital de imagens (2015) Matéria (UFRJ), 20, pp. 262-272; Rebouças Filho, P.P., Moreira, F.D.L., Xavier, F.G.L., Gomes, S.L., Santos, J.C., Freitas, F.N.C., Freitas, R.G., New analysis method application in metallographic images through the construction of mosaics via speeded up robust features and scale invariant feature transform (2015) Materials (Basel), 8, pp. 3864-3882; Rebouças, E.S., Sarmento, R.M., Rebouças Filho, P.P., 3d adaptive balloon active contour: Method of segmentation of structures in three dimensions (2015) Revista IEEE América Latina, 13, pp. 195-203; Ramalho, G.L.B., Rebouças Filho, P.P., Sombra, F.N.S., Cortez, P.C., Lung disease detection using feature extraction and extreme learning machine (2014) Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Biomédica (Impresso), 30, pp. 207-214; Rebouças Filho, P.P., Cortez, P.C., Barros, A.C.S., Albuquerque, V.H.C., Novel adaptive balloon active contour method based on internal force for image segmentation - A systematic evaluation on synthetic and real images (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41, pp. 7707-7721; Rebouças Filho, P.P., Cortez, O.C., Félix, J.H.S., Cavalcanti, T.S., Holanda, M.A., Modelo de contorno ativo crisp adaptativo 2d aplicado na segmentação dos pulmões em imagens de tc do tórax de voluntários sadios e pacientes com enfisema pulmonar (2013) Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Biomédica (Impresso), pp. 363-376; Cavalcanti Neto, E., Rebouças, E.S., Moraes, J.L., Gomes, S.L., Rebouças Filho, P.P., Development control parking access using techniques digital image processing and applied computational intelligence (2015) Revista IEEE América Latina, 13, pp. 272-276; Cavalcanti Neto, E., Gomes, S.L., Rebouças Filho, P.P., Albuquerque, V.H.C., Brazilian vehicle identification using a new embedded plate recognition system (2015) Measurement (London.

The area studied here was abandoned and after almost 30. years (smokeless visual) some companies use the actual minerals derived from burning coal cleaning rejects (BCCRs) complied in the mentioned area for industry tiles or refractory bricks. Mineralogical and geochemical similarities between the BCCRs and non-anthropogenic geological environments are outlined here. Although no visible flames were observed, this study revealed that auto-combustion existed in the studied area for many years. The presence of amorphous phases, mullite, hematite and other Fe-minerals formed by high temperature was found. There is also pyrite, Fe-sulphates (eg. jarosite) and unburnt coal present, which are useful for comparison purposes. Bad disposal of coal-dump wastes represents significant environmental concerns due to their potential influence on atmosphere, river sediments, soils and as well as on the surface and groundwater in the surroundings of these areas. The present study using advanced analytical techniques were performed to provide an improved understanding of the complex processes related with sulphide-rich coal waste oxidation, spontaneous combustion and mineral formation. It is reporting huge numbers of rare minerals with alunite, montmorillonite, szomolnokite, halotrichite, coquimbite and copiapite at the BCCRs. The data showed the presence of abundant amorphous Si-Al-Fe-Ti as (oxy-)hydroxides and Fe-hydro/oxides with goethite and hematite with various degrees of crystallinity, containing hazardous elements, such as Cu, Cr, Hf, Hg, Mo, Ni, Se, Pb, Th, U, Zr, and others. By Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the mineralogical composition was related with the range of elemental concentration of each sample. Most of the nano-minerals and ultra-fine particles found in the burned coal-dump wastes are the same as those commonly associated with coal cleaning rejects, in which oxidation of sulphides plays an important role to environment and human health. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Burning coal cleaning rejects (BCCRs); Coal fires; Human exposure; Nano-minerals","Amorphous silicon; Cleaning; Coal; Coal industry; Coal mines; Combustion; Environmental impact; Groundwater; Hazards; Hematite; Iron compounds; Minerals; Principal component analysis; Sediments; Silicate minerals; Spontaneous combustion; Sulfur compounds; Titanium; Uranium; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Coal fires; Degrees of crystallinity; Elemental concentrations; Environmental concerns; Geological environment; Human exposures; Mineralogical compositions; Ultrafine particle; Coal combustion; aluminum; aluminum silicate; alunite; coal; copiapite; coquimbite; ferric oxide; ferrous sulfate; ground water; halotrichite; iron; mineral; montmorillonite; nano mineral; pyrite; silicon; sulfide; szomolnokite; tin; unclassified drug; air pollutant; industrial waste; mineral; nanomaterial; burning; coal; combustion; crystallinity; emplacement; environmental impact; hazardous waste; health impact; high temperature; mineralogy; oxidation; principal component analysis; waste; waste disposal; analytic method; Article; atmosphere; Brazil; burning coal cleaning reject; city; coal mining; combustion; controlled study; dangerous goods; environmental impact; fire; flame; geochemical analysis; high temperature; industrial waste; mineralogy; oxidation; priority journal; river; sediment; soil; surface property; waste; waste disposal; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; fire; incineration; industrial waste; procedures; Brazil; Criciuma; Santa Catarina; Air Pollutants; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Incineration; Industrial Waste; Minerals; Nanostructures",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; aluminum silicate, 12183-80-1, 1302-93-8, 1318-74-7, 1335-30-4, 61027-90-5; ferric oxide, 1309-37-1, 56449-54-8; ferrous sulfate, 10028-21-4, 10124-49-9, 13463-43-9, 7720-78-7, 7782-63-0; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; montmorillonite, 1318-93-0, 61029-13-8; pyrite, 1309-36-0; silicon, 7440-21-3; sulfide, 18496-25-8; tin, 14314-35-3, 7440-31-5; Air Pollutants; Coal; Industrial Waste; Minerals",,,"Eusko Jaurlaritza

We propose new meta-level features especially designed for the sentiment analysis of short messages such as: (i) information derived from the sentiment distribution among the k nearest neighbors of a given short test document x, (ii) the distribution of distances of x to their neighbors and (iii) the document polarity of these neighbors given by unsupervised lexical-based methods. Our approach is also capable of exploiting information from the neighborhood of document x regarding (highly noisy) data obtained from 1.6 million Twitter messages with emoticons. The set of proposed features is capable of transforming the original feature space into a new one, potentially smaller and more informed. Experiments performed with a substantial number of datasets (nineteen) demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed sentiment-based meta-level features is not only superior to the traditional bag-of-word representation (by up to 16%) but is also superior in most cases to state-of-art meta-level features previously proposed in the literature for text classification tasks that do not take into account some idiosyncrasies of sentiment analysis. Our proposal is also largely superior to the best lexicon-based methods as well as to supervised combinations of them. In fact, the proposed approach is the only one to produce the best results in all tested datasets in all scenarios. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.","Meta features; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Text processing; Websites; World Wide Web; Bag of words; Feature space; K-nearest neighbors; Lexicon-based; Meta-features; Sentiment analysis; Short message; Text classification; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Brazil itself is among the ten largest producers of rice, and most of the harvest comes from the South and Midwest regions. This paper presents a data mining study of samples of rice obtained from producers in Goiás (Midwest region) and Rio Grande do Sul (South region), and builds classification models capable of predicting the geographical origin of a rice sample based on its chemical components. We use three popular classification techniques, support vector machines, random forests and neural networks, along with the F-score formula which measures the relative importance of the input variables. We achieved very good performances for the SVM, RF and MLP models with 93.66%, 93.83% and 90% prediction accuracy, respectively, on the 10-fold cross validation. The F-score shows that Cd(cadmium), Rb(rubidium), Mg(magnesium) and K(potassium) are the four most relevant components for prediction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Classification; Data mining; F-score; ICP-MS; Rice; Support vector machines","Cereal products; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Mass spectrometry; Rubidium; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Classification models; Classification technique; F-score; Geographical origins; ICP-MS; Relevant components; Rice; Data mining; agricultural technology; classification; data mining; mass spectrometry; model validation; numerical method; phytochemistry; prediction; rice; spatial analysis; support vector machine; Brazil; Goias; Rio Grande do Sul",,,,,,,,"AL-Bakary, A.M., Ali, S.H., Genetic programming data construction method to handle data scarcity problem (2010) IJACT Int.

The strategy combines levels of concentration of trace elements and a data mining technique known as support vector machine (SVM). Nineteen elements (As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Pb, Rb, Se and Zn) were determined in organic (. n=. 17) and conventional (. n=. 33) rice samples by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (q-ICP-MS) and the variations found in their elemental composition resulted in profiles with useful information for classification purposes. With the proposed methodology, it was possible to predict the authenticity of organic rice samples with an accuracy of 98% when using the 19 original elements. An accuracy of 96% was found using only the elements Ca and Cd. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Authenticity; Chemometrics; Classification; Food analysis; Food composition; Q-ICP-MS; Rice; Support vector machine; Trace elements",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP

The most dramatic land cover and land use (LCLU) changes began in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Trans-Amazon Highway and large government projects associated with the expansion of agricultural settlement and cattle ranching, which cleared significant tropical forest cover in the areas of new and accelerated human development. Taking the changes in the LCLU over the past four decades as a basis, this study aims to determine the consequences of land cover (forest and savanna) and land use (pasturelands, mining and urban) changes on the hydroclimatology of the Itacaiúnas River watershed area of the located in the southeastern Amazon region. We analyzed a multi-decadal Landsat dataset from 1973, 1984, 1994, 2004 and 2013 and a 40-yr time series of water discharge from the Itacaiúnas River, as well as air temperature and relative humidity data over this drainage area for the same period. We employed standard Landsat image processing techniques in conjunction with a geographic object-based image analysis and multi-resolution classification approach. With the goal of detecting possible long-term trends, non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied, based on a Sen slope estimator on a 40-yr annual PREC, TMED and RH time series, considering the spatial average of the entire watershed. In the 1970s, the region was entirely covered by forest (99%) and savanna (~0.3%). Four decades later, only ~48% of the tropical forest remains, while pasturelands occupy approximately 50% of the watershed area. Moreover, in protected areas, nearly 97% of the tropical forest remains conserved, while the forest cover of non-protected areas is quite fragmented and, consequently, unevenly distributed, covering an area of only 30%. Based on observational data analysis, there is evidence that the conversion of forest cover to extensive and homogeneous pasturelands was accompanied by systematic modifications to the hydroclimatology cycle of the Itacaiúnas watershed, thus highlighting drier environmental conditions due to a rise in the region's air temperature, a decrease in the relative humidity, and an increase in river discharge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Brazil; Change detection; Deforestation impacts; Hydro-climate change; Water discharge","river water; air temperature; climate change; environmental conditions; forest cover; hydrometeorology; image analysis; land cover; land use change; Landsat; relative humidity; river discharge; savanna; tropical forest; watershed; air temperature; Article; climate change; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental protection; forest fragmentation; humidity; image analysis; image processing; land use; mining; observational study; pastureland; remote sensing; river; savanna; time series analysis; tropical rain forest; urban area; water supply; watershed; agriculture; animal; bovine; Brazil; environment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; human; procedures; tropic climate; Amazon River; Brazil; Itacaiunas Basin; Bos; Agriculture; Animals; Brazil; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Tropical Climate",,,,,,,,"Aldrich, S., Walker, R., Simmons, C., Caldas, M., Perz, S., Contentious land change in the Amazon's arc of deforestation (2012) Ann.

Among these, air quality of the surroundings is a key issue. Additionally, the environmental assessment of projects demands integrated approach taking in account all pollution sources. Therefore, specific focus has been put on the methodology for assessing impacts on air quality. This paper proposes an integrated index of environmental impact aiming to quantify the air quality impact of industrial operations around an urban area, in case of scarcity of in situ acquired data. This proposed pollution index is demonstrated by a case study conducted in the municipality of Congonhas, Brazil, in which contributions of five open pit mines and two smelters were studied. To achieve the pollution index, the wind rose and distances from the centroids of effective areas to the urban nucleus itself were considered, taking into account the wind projection areas from windward impacting sources on the leeward impacted urban site. The proposed index also includes the squared wind speed (proportional to the kinetic energy transferred in uplifting dust from ground surface). The method proposed is considered suitable for impact assignment for each one of the air pollution sources in the neighborhood of studied area. Some fluid dynamic aspects of airborne particulate matter are also studied by proposing a new equation for threshold saltation speed. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dust generation; Integrated impact; Open pit mines; Saltation velocity; Smelters","Air pollution; Air quality; Dust; Environmental impact; Fluid dynamics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Pollution; Urban growth; Wind; Airborne particulate matters; Cumulative impact assessment; Dust generation; Environmental assessment; Environmental resources; Integrated impact; Saltation velocity; Smelters; Open pit mining",,,,,,,,"Amarante, O.A.C., Silva, F.J.L., Andrade, P.E.P., (2010) Atlas Eólico: Minas Gerais, , Cemig Belo Horizonte; Baldocchi, D., (2012) Part 2 - Surface Boundary Layer: Teory and Principles, , http://nature.berkeley.edu/biometlab/espm129/notes/Lecture%2017%20Wind%20and%20Turbulence%20Part%202%20Surface%20Boundary%20Layer%20Theory%20and%20Principles%20notes.pdf, Lecture 17, wind and turbulence Accessed at; Bare, J.C., Development of impact assessment methodologies for environmental sustainability (2014) Clean Technol Environ Policy, 16, pp. 681-690; Bauer, B.O., Houser, C.A., Nickling, W.G., (2002) Analysis of Velocity Profiles from Wind Tunnel Experiments with Saltation, , Lee, Jeffrey A, Zobeck, Ted M (eds) Proceedings of ICAR5/GCTE-SEN Joint Conference, International Center for Arid and Semiarid Lands Studies, Texas Tech University, USA Publication 02-2, Lubbock; Buske, D., Vilhena, M.T., Tirabassi, T., Bodmann, B., Air pollution steady-state advection-diffusion equation: The general three-dimensional solution (2012) J Environ Prot, 3, pp. 1124-1134. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXlvFOhs7c%3D; Chakraborty, M.K., Ahmad, M., Singh, R.S., Pal, D., Bandopadhyay, C., Chaulya, S.K., Determination of the emission rate from various opencast mining operations (2002) Environ Model Softw, 5 (17), pp. 467-480; Creyssels, M., Dupont, P., Ould El Moctar, A., Valance, A., Cantat, I., Jenkins, J.T., Pasini, J.M., Rasmussen, K.R., Saltating particles in a turbulent boundary layer: Experiment and theory (2009) J Fluid Mech, 625, pp. 47-74. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXksV2htbs%3D; Davidson, C., Phalen, R., Solomon, P., Airborne particle matter and human health: A review (2005) Aerosol Sci Technol, 39, pp. 737-749. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXpvVSgt7w%3D; Davis, E.G., Pinto, E.J.A., Pinto, M.C.F., (2005) Apa sul Área de Proteção Ambiental sul da Região Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte, 9. , Parte A: Hidrologia/ Estudos Do Meio Físico.

However, little is known to date about the spatial distribution of sediment sources in most large scale river basins in South America. The objective of this work was to study the coal cleaning rejects (CCRs) spill that occurred from a CCRs impoundment pond into the Tubarão River, South Brazil, provided a unique occasion to study the importance and role of incidental nanoparticles associated with pollutant dispersal from a large-scale, acute aquatic pollution event. Multifaceted geochemical research by X-ray diffraction (XRD), High Resolution-Transmission Electron microscopy (HR-TEM)/(Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) EDS/(selected-area diffraction pattern) SAED, Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM)/EDS, and Raman spectroscopy, provided an in-depth understanding of importance of a nano-mineralogy approach of Aqueous Pollution Scenarios. The electron beam studies showed the presence of a number of potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) in nanoparticles (amorphous and minerals). Some of the neoformed ultrafine/nanoparticles found in the contaminated sediments are the same as those commonly associated with oxidation/transformation of oxides, silicates, sulfides, and sulfates. These data of the secondary ultra/nanoparticles, puts in evidence their ability to control the mobility of PHEs, suggesting possible presentations in environmental technology, including recuperation of sensitive coal mine. The developed methodology facilitated the sediment transport of the catchment providing consistent results and suggesting its usefulness as a tool for temporary rivers management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal cleaning rejects; Hazardous elements; Nanoparticle morphology; Sediments","Catchments; Coal; Coal mines; Enamels; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Environmental technology; Field emission microscopes; Hazards; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lake pollution; Minerals; Nanoparticles; Rivers; Scanning electron microscopy; Sediment transport; Sediments; Silicates; Sulfur compounds; Suspended sediments; Water quality; Contaminated sediment; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Geochemical research; Hazardous elements; In-depth understanding; Nanoparticle morphology; Potentially hazardous elements; Selected area diffraction patterns; River pollution; aluminum; ferric ion; fulvic acid; nanoparticle; oxide; silicate; sulfate; sulfide; titanium dioxide; coal; dangerous goods; fly ash; mineral; nanoparticle; silicate; sulfide; water pollutant; coal; dispersion; hazardous waste; nanoparticle; pollutant transport; sediment pollution; sediment transport; spatial distribution; suspended sediment; transformation; Article; Brazil; catchment; coal cleaning reject; coal mining; coastal waters; dangerous goods; diffraction; electron beam; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; field emission scanning electron microscopy; ionic strength; leaching; methodology; mineralogy; nano mineralogy; nanotechnology; oxidation; particle resuspension; pH; potentially hazardous element; Raman spectrometry; river basin; sediment transport; selected area diffraction pattern; spectroscopy; spillage; transmission electron microscopy; water pollutant; X ray diffraction; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; fly ash; procedures; river; scanning electron microscopy; sediment; spectrometry; water quality; Brazil; Santa Catarina; Tubarao River; Brazil; Coal; Coal Ash; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Hazardous Substances; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Minerals; Nanoparticles; Rivers; Silicates; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; X-Ray Diffraction",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; ferric ion, 20074-52-6; fulvic acid, 479-66-3; oxide, 16833-27-5; silicate, 12627-13-3; sulfate, 14808-79-8; sulfide, 18496-25-8; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; Coal; Coal Ash; Hazardous Substances; Minerals; Silicates; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Furthermore, how to visualize such patterns altogether getting insights from the graph to support wise decision-making? Although there are many algorithmic and visual techniques to analyze graphs, none of the existing approaches is able to present the structural information of graphs at large-scale. Hence, this paper describes StructMatrix, a methodology aimed at high-scalable visual inspection of graph structures with the goal of revealing macro patterns of interest. StructMatrix combines algorithmic structure detection and adjacency matrix visualization to present cardinality, distribution, and relationship features of the structures found in a given graph. We performed experiments in real, large-scale graphs with up to one million nodes and millions of edges. StructMatrix revealed that graphs of high relevance (e.g., Web, Wikipedia and DBLP) have characterizations that reflect the nature of their corresponding domains, our findings have not been seen in the literature so far. We expect that our technique will bring deeper insights into large graph mining, leveraging their use for decision making. © 2015 IEEE.","fast processing of large-scale graphs; graph mining; graph sense making; large graph visualization","Data mining; Decision making; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Visualization; Algorithmic structure; Fast Processing; Graph mining; Large graph visualization; Large-scale visualization; Sense making; Structural information; Structure detection; Graph theory",,,,,,,,"Holten, D., Hierarchical edge bundles: Visualization of adjacency relations in hierarchical data (2006) IEEE TVCG, 12 (5), pp. 741-748; Chau, D.H., Kittur, A., Hong, J.I., Faloutsos, C., Apolo: Making sense of large network data by combining rich user interaction and machine learning (2011) SIGCHI Conf on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 167-176; Kang, U., Tsourakakis, C.E., Faloutsos, C., Pegasus: A peta-scale graph mining system implementation and observations (2009) Data Mining 2009.

For that, we analyze the behavior of tourists and residents in four popular cities around the world in four continents: London, New York, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. We perform a spatio-temporal study of properties of the behavior of these two classes of users (tourists and residents). We have identified, for instance, that some locations have features that are more correlated with the tourists' behavior, and also that even in places frequented by tourists and residents there are clear distinction in the patterns of behavior of these groups of users. Our study also enables to identify which and when sights are popular. Our results could be useful in several cases, for example, to help in the development of new place recommendation systems for tourists, or to help city planners to better support tourists in their cities. © 2015 IEEE.","characterization; Foursquare; Location-based social networks; tourists","Characterization; City planners; Foursquare; Large-scale studies; Location-based social networks; New York; Spatio-temporal study; tourists; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Staab, S., Werthner, H., Ricci, F., Zipf, A., Gretzel, U., Fesenmaier, D.R., Paris, C., Knoblock, C., Intelligent systems for tourism (2002) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17 (6), pp. 53-64; Silva, T., Van De Melo, P., Almeida, J., Loureiro, A., Large-scale study of city dynamics and Urban social behavior using participatory sensing (2014) Wireless Communications, IEEE, 21 (1), pp. 42-51. , Feb; Choujaa, D., Dulay, N., (2009) Activity Recognition from Mobile Phone Data: State of the Art, Prospects and Open Problems, , Imperial College London; Gonzalez, M.C., Hidalgo, C.A., Barabasi, A.-L., Understanding individual human mobility patterns (2008) Nature, 453, pp. 779-782; Cheng, Z., Caverlee, J., Lee, K., Sui, D.Z., Exploring millions of footprints in location sharing services (2011) Proc. of ICWSM, pp. 81-88; Pianese, F., Kawsar, F., Ishizuka, H., Discovering and predicting user routines by differential analysis of social network traces (2013) Proc. of WoWMoM, pp. 1-9; Long, X., Jin, L., Joshi, J., Towards understanding traveler behavior in location-based social networks (2013) Globecom; Noulas, A., Scellato, S., Mascolo, C., Pontil, M., An empirical study of geographic user activity patterns in foursquare (2011) Proc. of ICWSM'11, , Barcelona, Spain; Preo, D., Cohn, T., Mining user behaviours: A study of check-in patterns in location based social networks (2013) Proc. of WebSci; Zheng, Y., Zhang, L., Xie, X., Ma, W.-Y., Mining interesting locations and travel sequences from GPS trajectories (2009) Proc. of WWW; Yoon, H., Zheng, Y., Xie, X., Woo, W., Smart itinerary recommendation based on user-generated GPS Trajectories (2010) Ubiq.

In fact, studies have shown that for every $1 spent on hardware in the datacenter, $0.50 is spent on powering this hardware over its lifetime. Data centers host real or virtual (i.e., cloud) clusters that often execute large compute jobs using MapReduce, of which Hadoop is a popular implementation. Like other successful open source projects, Hadoop has been maintained and evolved over time with new resource management features being added over time in an effort to improve performance, raising questions as to whether such architectural evolution has achieved its goal, and if so, at what cost. In this work we apply Green Mining to find out that later versions of Hadoop - who exhibit more dynamic resource control - can suffer from serious energy consumption performance regressions. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Energy utilization; Architectural evolution; Data centers; Dynamic resource control; Energy consumer; Green mining; Improve performance; Open source projects; Resource management; Hardware",,,,,,,,"Chidamber, S.R., Kemerer, C.F., A metrics suite for object oriented design (1994) Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 20 (6), pp. 476-493; Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Mapreduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters (2004) Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Symposium on Operating Systems Design & Implementation-Volume 6, OSDI'04, p. 10. , Berkeley, CA, USA,USENIX Association; Hassan, A.E., The road ahead for mining software repositories (2008) Proceedings of the Future of Software Maintenance (FoSM) at the 24th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance; Hindle, A., Green mining: A methodology of relating software change and configuration to power consumption (2013) Empirical Software Engineering, pp. 1-36; Hindle, A., Wilson, A., Rasmussen, K., Barlow, J., Campbell, J., Romansky, S., GreenMiner: A hardware based mining software repositories software energy consumption framework (2014) Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2014 11th IEEE W.

In this article, we present an entirely new method for rule extraction in knowledge-based systems that consists in retrieving an initial set of rules extracted from a knowledge base using conventional logical approaches and then ranking this initial set of rules applying a psychologically motivated multicriteria decision analysis method. We show how this method can be used to implement a knowledge-based management system, demonstrate that this method outperforms the most efficient algorithms for rule extraction proposed to date in the knowledge representation and knowledge discovery fields, and describe its implementation in a knowledge-based innovation tutoring system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Innovation management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge representation; Knowledge-based systems; Multicriteria decision analysis","Algorithms; Decision making; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Extraction; Formal logic; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Neural networks; Black box approach; First order logic; Hybrid approach; Innovation management; Knowledge based; Knowledge discovery and data minings; Logical approaches; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Data mining",,,,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD

On the other hand, such inducers present some instability. The main problem handled here refers to the behavior of those inducers when it comes to high-dimensional data, more specifically to gene expression data: irrelevant attributes may harm the learning process and many models with similar performance may be generated. In order to treat those problems, we have explored and revised windowing: pruning of the trees generated during intermediary steps of the algorithm; the use of the estimated error instead of the training error; the use of the error weighted according to the size of the current window; and the use of the classification confidence as the window update criterion. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperform the classical one, especially considering measures of complexity and comprehensibility of the induced models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the complexity of maintenance tasks and the time-to-market, developers make poor implementation choices, also known as code smells. Studies indicate that code smells hinder comprehensibility, and possibly increase change- and fault-proneness. Therefore, they must be identified to enable the application of corrections. The challenge is that the inaccurate definitions of code smells make developers disagree whether a piece of code is a smell or not, consequently, making difficult creation of a universal detection solution able to recognize smells in different software projects. Several works have been proposed to identify code smells but they still report inaccurate results and use techniques that do not present to developers a comprehensive explanation how these results have been obtained. In this experimental report we study the effectiveness of the Decision Tree algorithm to recognize code smells. For this, it was applied in a dataset containing 4 open source projects and the results were compared with the manual oracle, with existing detection approaches and with other machine learning algorithms. The results showed that the approach was able to effectively learn rules for the detection of the code smells studied. The results were even better when genetic algorithms are used to pre-select the metrics to use. © 2015 IEEE.","Code Smells; Decision Tree; Genetic Algorithm; Software Quality","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Data mining; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Odors; Open source software; Program debugging; Trees (mathematics); Code smell; Decision-tree algorithm; Detection approach; Experience report; Maintenance tasks; Open source projects; Software Quality; Universal detections; Software reliability",,,,,,,,"Lehman, M.M., Belady, L.A., (1985) Software Evolution-Processes of Software Change, , Academic Press London; Fowler, M., Beck, K., Brant, J., Opdyke, W., Roberts, D., (1999) Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, , Boston, MA, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc; Abbes, M., Khomh, F., Gueheneuc, Y.G., Antoniol, G., Anempirical study of the impact of two antipatterns, blob and spaghetti code, on program comprehension (2011) 15th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, Ser.

Peripheral blood and tissue T-cells as well as cytokine levels were quantified by flow cytometry. Results: Data analysis demonstrated higher frequency of circulating CD8+ T-cells and Tregs along with a mixed proinflammatory/IL-10-modulated cytokine pattern in HCV patients. Patients with severe liver fibrosis presented lower frequency of circulating CD8+ T-cells, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but lower levels of IL-10, in addition to the higher viral load. Despite the lower frequency of intrahepatic T-cells and scarce frequency of Tregs, patients with severe liver fibrosis showed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IFN-γ). The tissue proinflammatory cytokine pattern supported further studies of serum cytokines as relevant biomarkers associated with different liver fibrosis scores. Serum cytokine signature showed that mild liver fibrosis is associated with higher IL-10 serum levels as compared to severe liver disease. There was a clear positive connection of IL-10 with the TNF node in patients with mild liver fibrosis, whereas there is an evident inverse correlation between IL-10 with all other cytokine nodes. Conclusions: These results suggest the absence of modulatory events in patients with severe liver damage as opposed to mild fibrosis. Machine-learning data mining pointed out TNF and IL-10 as major attributes to differentiate HCV patients from non-infected individuals with highest performance. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that HCV infection triggers a local and systemic cytokine ensemble orchestrated by TNF and tuned by IL-10 in such a manner that mirrors the liver fibrosis score, which highly suggests the relevance of these set of biomarkers for clinical investigations. © 2016 de Souza-Cruz et al.","Cytokine; HCV; Liver fibrosis","interleukin 10; tumor necrosis factor; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; adult; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine production; disease association; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; hepatitis C; human; human cell; human tissue; liver fibrosis; liver parenchyma; male; protein blood level; regulatory T lymphocyte; virus load; aged; blood; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; immunology; liver; liver cirrhosis; middle aged; physiology; virology; Adult; Aged; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Humans; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-10; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-10",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

These algorithms assume that the items to be clustered are non-stochastic, an assumption not held in many applications. In this work, we present a new probabilistic regionalization algorithm that allows spatially varying random variables as features. Hence, an area highly different from its neighbors can still be considered a member of their cluster if it has a large variance. Our proposal is based on a Bayesian generative spatial product partition model. We build an effective Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out a random walk on the space of all trees and their induced spatial partitions by edges' deletion. We evaluate our algorithm using synthetic data and with one problem of municipalities regionalization based on cancer incidence rates. We are able to better accommodate the natural variation of the data and to diminish the effect of outliers, producing better results than state-of-art approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","Bayesian spatial model; Spatial graphical model; Spatially constrained clustering","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Geographical regions; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Constrained clustering; Geographical area; GraphicaL model; Markov chain monte carlo algorithms; Natural variation; Regionalization algorithms; Spatial clustering; Spatial modeling; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,"Wise, S., Haining, R., Ma, J., Regionalisation tools for the exploratory spatial analysis of health data (1997) Recent Developments in Spatial Analysis, pp. 83-100. , ser.

Data streams are, by definition, potentially unbounded sequences of data that arrive intermittently at rapid rates. Extracting useful knowledge from data streams embeds virtually all problems from conventional data mining with the addition of single-pass real-time processing within limited time and memory space. Additionally, due to its ephemeral nature, it is expected that streams undergo changes in its data distribution denominated concept drifts. In this work, we focus on one specific kind of concept drift that has not been extensively addressed in the literature, namely feature drift. A feature drift happens when changes occur in the set of features, such that a subset of features become, or cease to be, relevant to the learning problem. Specifically, changes in the relevance of features directly imply modifications in the decision boundary to be learned, thus the learner must detect and adapt to according to it. Timely detection and recover from feature drifts is a challenging task that can be modeled after a dynamic feature selection problem. In this paper we survey existing work on dynamic feature selection for data streams that acts either implicitly or explicitly. We conclude that there is a need for future research in this area, which we highlight as future research directions. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer hardware description languages; Data communication systems; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Sensor networks; Surveys; Conventional data mining; Decision boundary; Dynamic feature selections; Future research directions; Intrusion Detection Systems; Real world situations; Realtime processing; Stock market analysis; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Bifet, A., Read, J., Zliobaite, I., Pfahringer, B., Holmes, G., Pitfalls in benchmarking data stream classification and how to avoid them (2013) ECML/PKDD, (1), pp. 465-479; Kosina, P., Gama, J.A., Very fast decision rules for multi-class problems (2012) Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 795-800. , http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2245276.2245431, ser.

In such environments, the data distribution usually changes over time, which is known as concept drift. This paper presents a genetic algorithm aimed at adjusting the parameters of concept drift detection methods to improve their accuracies. Experiments were performed with four drift detectors, comparing their results using the values as presented by their original proposals to those using the average of the values returned by the genetic algorithm on multiple datasets containing the same type of concept drifts. Tests were performed in nine artificial datasets, each one with abrupt, slow gradual, and fast gradual concept drifts versions, as well as three real-world datasets. Results indicate that the predictive accuracies statistically increased in many situations. © 2015 IEEE.","Concept drift detectors; Data stream; Genetic algorithm; Online learning","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Artificial datasets; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Data stream; Multiple data sets; Online learning; Predictive accuracy; Real-world datasets; Parameter estimation",,,,,,,,"Gama, J., Zliobaite, I., Bifet, A., Pechenizkiy, M., Bouchachia, A., A survey on concept drift adaptation (2014) ACM Computing Surveys, 46 (4), pp. 441-537; Bifet, A., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Kirkby, R., Gavalda, R., New ensemble methods for evolving data streams (2009) Proc. 15th ACM SIGKDD Int.

Most of the state-of-the-art RE systems rely on statistical machine learning techniques which usually employ an attribute-value representation of features. Contrarily to this trend, we focus on an alternative approach to RE based on the automatic induction of symbolic extraction rules. We present OntoILPER, an RE system based on Inductive Logic Programming which uses a domain ontology in its extraction process. Several experiments are discussed in this paper over the reACE 2004/2005 reference corpora. The results are encouraging and seem to demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed solution. © 2015 IEEE.","Inductive Logic Programming; Ontology Population; Ontology-based Information Extraction; Relation Extraction","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Data mining; Learning systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Semantics; Automatic induction; Domain ontologies; Extraction process; Ontology Population; Ontology-based information extraction; Relation extraction; Semantic relations; Statistical machine learning; Inductive logic programming (ILP)",,,,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R.A., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval: Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing, , Boston, USA; Charniak, E., Johnson, M., Coarse-to-fine n-best parsing and maxent discriminative reranking (2005) Proc. of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Comp, pp. 173-180. , Ling.

Large-scale ICT interventions can be an option for countries whose regions, both urban and rural, present a high number of digitally excluded people. Our goal was to monitor and identify problems in interventions aimed at certification for a large number of participants in different geographical regions. Our case study is the training at the Telecentros.BR, a program created in Brazil to install telecenters and certify individuals to use ICT resources. We propose an approach that applies social network analysis and mining techniques to data collected from Telecentros.BR dataset and from the socioeconomics and telecommunications infrastructure indicators of the participants' municipalities. We found that (i) the analysis of interactions in different time periods reflects the objectives of each phase of training, highlighting the increased density in the phase in which participants develop and disseminate their projects; (ii) analysis according to the roles of participants (i.e., tutors or community members) reveals that the interactions were influenced by the center (or region) to which the participant belongs (that is, a community contained mainly members of the same region and always with the presence of tutors, contradicting expectations of the training project, which aimed for intense collaboration of the participants, regardless of the geographic region); (iii) the social network of participants influences the success of the training: That is, given evidence that the degree of the community member is in the highest range, the probability of this individual concluding the training is 0.689; (iv) the North region presented the lowest probability of participant certification, whereas the Northeast, which served municipalities with similar characteristics, presented high probability of certification, associated with the highest degree in social networking platform. © 2016 Silva et al.

Due to the increasing of the size of the datasets, techniques for instance selection have been applied for reducing the data to a manageable volume, leading to a reduction of the computational resources that are necessary for performing the learning process. Besides that, algorithms of instance selection can also be applied for removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances, before applying learning algorithms. This step can improve the accuracy in classification problems. In the last years, several approaches for instance selection have been proposed. However, most of them have long runtimes and, due to this, they cannot be used for dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective density-based approach for instance selection. Our approach, called LDIS (local density-based instance selection), evaluates the instances of each class separately and keeps only the densest instances in a given (arbitrary) neighborhood. This ensures a reasonably low time complexity. Our approach was evaluated on 15 well-known data sets and its performance was compared with the performance of 5 state-of-the-art algorithms, considering three measures: accuracy, reduction and effectiveness. For evaluating the accuracy achieved using the datasets produced by the algorithms, we applied the KNN algorithm. The results show that LDIS achieves a performance (in terms of balance of accuracy and reduction) that is better or comparable to the performances of the other algorithms considered in the evaluation © 2015 IEEE.","Data mining; Dataset reduction; Instance reduction; Instance selection; Instance-based learning; Machine learning","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Computational resources; Density-based approaches; Effective density; Instance based learning; Instance selection; Learning process; Pre-processing step; State-of-the-art algorithms; Data reduction",,,,,,,,"García, S., Luengo, J., Herrera, F., (2015) Data Preprocessing in Data Mining, , Springer; Chou, C.-H., Kuo, B.-H., Chang, F., The generalized condensed nearest neighbor rule as a data reduction method (2006) Pattern Recognition, 2006.

The objective of this study was to identify rot grain by combining techniques of data mining and digital image processing, analyzing histograms of images with different mining algorithms. In addition, we identified what algorithms showed better results for the identification of rot grain. 126 maize grains were used, 50% of healthy grains and 50% rot grain. A scanner for obtaining images of individual grains, processed to extract histograms and generating the database has been used. With the Weka software, the base was subjected to different data mining algorithms, generating a solution, and subsequent classification tests. The algorithms performed better, with hit rates above 90%, were NaiveBayes and NaiveBayesUpdateables. As a result of this work, it is verified that histograms of the images, together with data mining algorithms, can assist in the identification of rot corn grain.","Digital image processing; Grain classification; Weka; Zea mays",,,,,,,,,"Costa, R.S., Môro, F.V., Môro, J.R., Da Silva, H.P., Panizzi, R.D.C., Relação entre características morfológicas da cariopse e fusariose em milho (2003) Pesquisa Agropecuária Brasileira, Brasília, 38 (1), p. 2733; Costa, F.D.O., Motta, L.C.S., Nogueira, J.L.T., Uma abordagem baseada em Redes Neurais Artificiais para o auxílio ao diagnóstico de doenças meningocócicas (2010) Revista Brasileira de Computação Aplicada, 2 (1), p. 7988; Cruz, J.C., Pereira Filho, I.A., Pimentel, M.A.G., Coelho, A.M., Karam, D., Cruz, I., Garcia, J.C., Matrangolo, W.J.R., Produção de milho na agricultura familiar (2011) Sete Lagoas: Embrapa Milho e Sorgo, 159, p. 4; Dziekaniak, G., Tecnologias de descoberta de conhecimento na gestão do conhecimento: contextualizações com a sociedade do conhecimento (2010) Datagrama Zero, 11 (1); Gonzalez, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2010) Processamento Digital de Imagens, p. 976. , 3 ed., São Paulo: Pearson Prentice Hall; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The Weka Data Mining Software: An Update (2009) SIGKDD Explorations, 11 (1); Jiawei, H., Kamber, M., (2011) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, p. 744. , 3 ed., Morgan Kaufmann; Kotz, S., Johnson, N.L., (1983) Encyclopedia of statistical sciences, p. 672. , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Marques Filho, O., Vieira Neto, H., (1999) Processamento Digital de Imagens, p. 307. , Rio de Janeiro: Brasport; Mendes, M.C., Von Pinho, R.G., Von Pinho, E.V.R., Faria, M.V., Comportamento de híbridos de milho inoculados com os fungos causadores do complexo grãos ardidos e associação com parâmetros químicos e bioquímicos (2012) Ambiência, Guarapuava, 8 (2), p. 275292; Name, M.H., Método computacional para avaliação do crescimento radicular da cultura da soja (2013), p. 62. , Dissertação (Mestrado em Computação Aplicada) - Setor de Ciências Agrárias e de Tecnologia, Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa, Ponta Grossa; Name, M.H., Ribeiro, S.S., Maruyama, T.M., Valle, H.P., Falate, R., Vaz, M.S.M.G., Metadata Extraction for Calculating Object Perimeter in Images (2014) Revista IEEE América Latina, 12 (8). , 15661571; Name, M.H., Martins Júnior, H.L., Maruyama, T.M., Falate, R., Development and comparison of software for the evaluation of root length (2016) Espacios, 37 (4), p. 22; Olson, D., Delen, O.D., (2008) Advanced Data Mining Techiniques, p. 180. , Springer; Pacheco, D.A.J., Machado, L., Jung, C.F., Ten Caten, C.S., Investigando o uso da mineração de dados nos processos de gestão da qualidade total: um estudo de caso na indústria (2013) Espacios, 34 (6), p. 15; Pinto, N.F.J.A., Grãos ardidos em milho (2005), 66, p. 1. , Sete Lagoas: Embrapa Milho e Sorgo; Ribeiro, S.S., Cultura do Milho no Brasil (2014) Revista Científica Semana Acadêmica, 49 (1), p. 113; Santos, P.G., Juliatti, F.C., Buiatti, A.L., Hamawaki, O.T., Avaliação do desempenho agronômico de híbridos de milho em Uberlândia, MG, Pesquisa Agropecuária Brasileira (2002) Brasília, 37 (5), p. 597602; Santos, R., Java Advanced Imaging API: A Tutorial"", Revista de Informática Teórica e Aplicada (2004) Rio Grande do Sul, 11 (1), p. 93123; Towell, G.G., Shavlik, J.W., Noodewier, M.O., Refinement of approximate domain theories by knowledgebased artificial neural networks (1990) Proceedings of the 8th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI90), 2, pp. 861-866; Valle, H.P., Maruyama, T.M., Name, M.H., Falate, R., Development of Image Segmentation Method Through Contour Algorithms (2013) Iberoamerican Journal of Applied Computing, 3 (3), p. 112",,,,"Revista Espacios",,,,,07981015,,,,"Portuguese","Espacios",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013679231

The present study aimed to use data mining techniques and landscape ecology metrics to classify and quantify different types of vegetation using a multitemporal analysis (2001 and 2011), in São Luís do Paraitinga city, São Paulo, Brazil. Object-based image analyses and the C4.5 data-mining algorithm were used for automated classification. Classification accuracies were assessed using the kappa index of agreement and the recently proposed allocation and quantity disagreement measures. Four land use and land cover classes were mapped, including Eucalyptus plantations, whose area increased from 4.4% to 8.6%. The automatic classification showed a kappa index of 0.79 and 0.80, quantity disagreements of 2% e 3.5% and allocation measures of 5.5% and 5% for 2001 and 2011, respectively. We therefore concluded that the data mining method and landscape ecology metrics were efficient in separating vegetation classes. © 2016, Federal University of Lavras.

Data mining techniques have been coupled with metaheuristics in order to obtain patterns of suboptimal solutions that are used to guide the heuristic search for better-cost solutions in less computational time. This kind of hybridization has been successfully explored to solve several optimization problems, for which the solutions and their patterns are limitedly characterized by sets of elements. The challenge of this work is to extend this hybrid approach to a broader domain. We therefore propose a hybrid data mining heuristic to solve the one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem, for which solutions are defined by sequences of elements. Computational experiments, conducted on a set of instances from the literature, showed that the hybrid heuristic reached better-costs solutions faster than the original strategy. This way, it was evidenced that not only problems whose solutions are represented by sets of elements can benefit from the hybridization of metaheuristics with data mining, but also problems whose solutions are represented by a sequence of elements. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

This paper presents a method for the analysis of occurrences of pairs and groups of species that aims to identify patterns in co-occurrences through the application of association rules of data mining. We propose, implement and evaluate a tool to help ecologists formulate and validate hypotheses regarding co-occurrence between two or more species. To validate our approach, we analyzed the occurrence of species with a dataset from the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Project on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). Three case studies were developed based on this tropical forest to evaluate patterns of positive and negative correlation. Our tool can be used to point co-occurrence in a multi-scale form and for multi-species, simultaneously, accelerating the identification process for the Spatial Point Pattern Analysis. This paper demonstrates that data mining, which has been used successfully in applications such as business and consumer profile analysis, can be a useful resource in ecology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The task can be implemented by a particular group of data mining algorithms i.e., those that can identify and extract relevant information from retail databases. Usually it is expected that such algorithms deliver a set of conditional rules, referred to as association rules, each identifying a particular relationship between data items in the database. If the extracted set of rules is representative and sound, it can be successfully used for supporting administrative decisions or for making accurate predictions on new incoming data. This work describes the computational system S_MEMISP+AR, based on the MEMISP approach, and its use in two case studies, defined under different settings, related to the extraction of association rules in a real database from a retail company.

Trabalhador São-Carlense, 400, São Carlos, Brazil","Learning sequences are important aspects in learning environments. Students should learn by moving gradually from simpler to more complex concepts, promoting deeper levels of learning. This feature is usually embedded in most intelligent learning environments to guide the student in the study of subject matter. The organization of this knowledge structure is usually an intensive effort of human experts, in creating a logical ordering of what is to be taught - determining the concepts and the prerequisite relations among them. In recent years, some methods have been developed for dealing with this knowledge structuring using data coming from logs of learning environments, applying data mining techniques to discover prerequisite rules and create directed graphs of prerequisites. These methods model both assessment items and skills underlying those items. The automatic methods developed so far present a semantic gap between the probabilistic analysis and the expert knowledge, sometimes causing confusion with the results. This research aims to bridge this gap by adding a minimal layer of semantic information to help in the data mining process. As an application, we intend to analyze large-scale assessment datasets, considering its specificities, and evaluate if those hybrid models can improve the prediction of item success. © 2016 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, the processing capacity of data mining algorithms is struggling under this growth. One alternative for tackling the problem is to perform instance selection on the data in order to reduce its size, as a preprocessing step for data mining algorithms. This study presents e-MGD, a method for instance selection as an extension of the Markov Geometric Diffusion method, which is a linear complexity method used in computergraphics for the simplification of triangular meshes. The original method was extended so that it was capable of reducing datasets commonly found in the field of data mining. For this purpose, two essential points of adjustment were required. Firstly, it was necessary to build a geometric structure from the data and secondly, to adjust the method so that it could deal with types of attributes encountered within these datasets. These adjustments however, did not influence the complexity of the final e-MGD, since it remained linear, which enabled it to be applied to datasets with a greater number of instances and features. One distinct characteristic of the proposed extension is that it focuses on preserving dataset information rather than improving classification accuracy, as in the case of most instance selection methods. In order to assess the performance of the method, we compared it with a number of classical and contemporary instance selection methods using medium to large datasets, plus a further set of very large datasets.

We use a dataset of blind and sight people during an activity of spatial patterns recognition. The dataset was acquired through a BCI System, when individuals have to identify 3D geometric objects. The collected brain signals were preprocessed and used as input in Weka data mining software, more specifically the J48 algorithm. In our tests, we find decisions trees which indicate that blind people do not have significant activities in the occipital lobe (visual memory) to identify the objects. Sight people, instead, have significant activities in the occipital lobe, even when they are blindfolded. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Brain computer interface; Brain signals; Decision trees; Neuroscience","Brain computer interface; Data mining; Decision trees; Forestry; Interfaces (computer); Pattern recognition; Trees (mathematics); Blind people; Brain data; Brain signals; Data-mining software; Geometric objects; Neuroscience; Spatial patterns; Visual memory; Brain",,,,,,,,"de Sá, E.D., de Campos, I.M., Silva, M.B.C., Atendimento Educacional Especializado: Deficiência Visual, , MEC, SEESP (2007) (in Portuguese); Eyzaguirre, C., Fisiologia do sistema nervoso.

Indeed, bus trajectories provide a useful data source for analyzing traffic, if the city is served by a dense bus network and the city traffic authority makes the bus trajectories available openly, timely and in a continuous way. This paper explores the design of a traffic observatory application based on bus trajectories, defined as an application developed to detect when the traffic patterns of selected streets of a city, observed during certain periods of time, deviate from the typical traffic patterns. The major contributions of the paper are a list of requirements for traffic observatory applications, a detailed discussion of key operations on bus trajectories and a description of experiments with a traffic observatory prototype using bus trajectories made available by the traffic authority of the City of Rio de Janeiro.

At the same time, the known difficulty of the amount of professionals being graduated in the area. Some states study the difficulty of the students and at the same time the lack of methodology in a way to use this as a possible elements contributing to this context, colaborating the necessety of desenvolvement of studies about the learning of languages of programming. Inside the possible solutions to this motivation problem, the desenvolvement of an enviroment gameficated as a way of a learning tool for programming languages are being explores in studying projecta and in commercial options. One of the observed difficulties in these projects is the lack of support to the teachers for acompanning the desenvolvement of the students. Searching to attend this problem, this project shows an helping enviroment to the learning of programming logic where is the inclusion of resources of the analysis of the behavior of the students for the support of teachers. This way, the project presented brings together electronic games and on-line monitoring of each step through the use of educational data mining techniques. Using an gamefication framework, it was defined and desenvolved an WEB enviroment for the teaching of LUA language, with aspects of gamefication and educational data mining. This enviroment was tested preliminarily with students of technical education with good results. The desenvolvement of the enviroment of this project showed that gamefication is an excelent motivational resource for learning of the concepts of programming language and that educational data mining helped the teachers to learn the diffiulties of the students, and like that, propose changes in the progamming logic learning methodology. © The Authors, 2016.

Several methods using different conceptions have been proposed to determine the future configuration of the electric markets. This paper proposes a dynamic model of load expansion, based on concepts of local analysis using ideas and applications from urban poles theory. Thus, the load expansion is simulated in a dynamic way, maintaining a continuous change in the conditions for localization of a new load unit. An algorithm generating a snapshot that represents the distribution system configuration at that instant determines the geometry of the market in a given instant. The proposed dynamic model, based on the urban poles theory, has the capacity for summing up the information from economic variables sets, expressed in terms of interchange flow laws, which are modeled by distance and transportation functions. This supplies the model with the capacity for being used even though the number of available explanatory variables is reduced. © 2016 AECE.","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Load modeling; Power distribution; Urban areas",,,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Field data were collected in six sampling plots with 1,600 m² each. Digital processing utilized three high resolution images (0.39 m) obtained by SAAPI sensor with three visible bands, three near infrared bands, one terrain and one surface model. Extracted data from the digital product (attributes) were used for data mining purposes, selecting the ones with relevance and dismissing those of lesser weight. It was found that both tree and regeneration layers are heterogeneous considering number of individuals (N), diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area (AB). However, significant correlations between forest attributes and field data were found. The higher correlation of N is with the average of the band 1 (-0.64), 3 (-0.62) and IR1 (0.63) for DBH was the ratio of bands IR3 (0.56) and 2 (0.55) and the variable AB was the smallest pixel value of band 1 (-0.64) and IR3 (-0.60). All correlation coefficients were highly significant (p <0.01). These results constitute the starting point for future research on the relationship between groups of variables in order to estimate biophysical parameters. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Parana.

Recently, some algorithms have been proposed to cluster data streams as a whole, but just few of them deal with multivariate data streams. Even so, these algorithms merely aggregate the attributes without touching upon the correlation among them. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a new framework to cluster multivariate data streams based on their evolving behavior over time, exploring the correlations among their attributes by computing the fractal dimension. Experimental results with climate data streams show that the clusters' quality and compactness can be improved compared to the competing method, leading to the thoughtfulness that attributes correlations cannot be put aside. In fact, the clusters' compactness are 7 to 25 times better using our method. Our framework also proves to be an useful tool to assist meteorologists in understanding the climate behavior along a period of time. © The Authors.

The trajectory of each CoP is extracted from the contact points of the feet with the ground form each footprint. The data was collected with a GaitRite® Pressure Sensor Mat. The proposed method includes the standardization of data and creation of an organized repository (data warehouse) from previously collected data. Also, it includes the development of a process mining example to analytical comparison between these two different groups.

Assuming that their audience is aware of background and real world events, users can shorten their messages without compromising communication. However, traditional data mining algorithms do not account for contextual information. We argue that exploiting context can lead to advancements in the analysis of social media messages. Recall rate increases if context is taken into account, leading to context-aware methods for filtering messages without resorting only to keywords. A novel approach for subject classification of social media messages, using computational linguistics techniques, is proposed, employing both textual and extra-textual (or contextual) information. Experimental analysis over sports-related messages indicates over 50% improvement in retrieval rate over text-based approaches due to the use of contextual information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Social media","Algorithms; Big data; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Search engines; Social networking (online); Contextual information; Data mining algorithm; Experimental analysis; Language model; Retrieval rate; Social media; Subject classification; Text-based approach; Data mining",,,,,,,,"(2008) Nature, 455 (7209), p. 1; Calais Guerra, P.H., Veloso, A., Meira, W., Jr., Almeida, V., From bias to opinion: A transfer-learning approach to real-time sentiment analysis (2011) Proceedings of the 17Th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 150-158. , ACM; Davis, C.A., Pappa, G.L., De Oliveira, D.R.R., De L Arcanjo, F., Inferring the location of Twitter messages based on user relationships (2011) Trans.

This paper proposes an approach for data clustering using the Symbiotic Organisms Search algorithm (SOS) developed in the MapReduce parallel architecture. Also, the cluster quality evolution is analysed using the purity measured considering four different fitness metrics. The cluster qualities obtained by the proposed approach not only shows to be competitive with other approaches but also increased its performance using the MapReduce architecture. Another contribution of this work is to bring to light the correlation between the cluster purity and the fitness value obtained during the optimization process. It was noticed that for some fitness metrics the final purity found by the optimization algorithm is less than the purity found in an earlier stage in the optimization process.","Bio-inspired algorithms; Data clustering; Hadoop mapreduce","Biology; Cluster analysis; Cluster computing; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Health; Information systems; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Bio-inspired algorithms; Cluster qualities; Data clustering; Data mining tasks; Hadoop MapReduce; High dimensionality; Optimization algorithms; Search Algorithms; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,,"Al-Madi, N., Aljarah, I., Ludwig, S.A., Parallel glowworm swarm optimization clustering algorithm based on mapreduce (2014) Swarm Intelligence (SIS), 2014 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Aljarah, I., Ludwig, S.A., Parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm based on mapreduce methodology (2012) Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC), 2012 Fourth World Congress on, pp. 104-111. , IEEE; Aljarah, I., Ludwig, S.A., Mapreduce intrusion detection system based on a particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm (2013) Evolutionary Computation (CEC), 2013 IEEE Congress on, pp. 955-962. , IEEE; Bhavani, R., Sadasivam, G.S., A novel ant based clustering of gene expression data using mapreduce framework (2014) International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication, 2, pp. 398-402; Cheng, M.-Y., Prayogo, D., Symbiotic organisms search: A new metaheuristic optimization algorithm (2014) Computers & Structures, 139, pp. 98-112; Cheng, S., Shi, Y., Qin, Q., Bai, R., Swarm intelligence in big data analytics (2013) Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning-IDEAL 2013, pp. 417-426. , Springer; Dalal, M., Harale, N., A survey on clustering in data mining (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference & Workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology, pp. 559-562. , ACM; Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Mapreduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters (2008) Communications of the ACM, 51 (1), pp. 107-113; Eberhart, R.C., Kennedy, J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory (1995) Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, 1, pp. 39-43. , New York, NY; Judith, J., Jayakumari, J., An efficient hybrid distributed document clustering algorithm (2015) Scientific Research and Essays, 10 (1), pp. 14-22; Katal, A., Wazid, M., Goudar, R., Big data: Issues, challenges, tools and good practices (2013) Contemporary Computing (IC3), 2013 Sixth International Conference on, pp. 404-409. , IEEE; Krishnanand, K., Ghose, D., Detection of multiple source locations using a glowworm metaphor with applications to collective robotics (2005) Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005.

This algorithm uses a set of classifiers based on decision trees. In this sense, the performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated in a comparative way between the Random Forest and the type J48 Decision Tree. For this analysis to be possible, synthetic electrical signals were generated, where these disturbances were modeled through parametric equations. After the performance analysis, it was observed that the results were promising, since the Random Forest algorithm provides the best performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Decision trees; Feature extraction; Pattern classification; Power quality; Random forest","Decision trees; Feature extraction; Pattern recognition; Power quality; Big data; Electrical signal; Large amounts of data; Parametric equation; Performance analysis; Power quality disturbances; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Data mining",,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP: 2011/17610-0, 2013/16778-0","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the development of this research provided by FAPESP (Process 2011/17610-0 and 2013/16778-0).",,"Dugan, R.C., McGranagham, M.F., Santoso, S., Beaty, H.W., (2002) Electrical Power Systems Quality, , 3rd edn.

However, privacy measures either assume centralized data source or that no insider is going to try to infer some information. This paper presents distributed privacy measures that take into account collusion attacks and point level breaches for distributed data clustering. An analysis of representative distributed data clustering algorithms show that collusion is an important source of privacy issues and that the analyzed algorithms exhibit different vulnerabilities to collusion groups. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Cluster analysis; Data handling; Data mining; Data privacy; Information analysis; Collusion attack; Data-source; Distributed data; Privacy awareness; Privacy issue; Privacy measures; Privacy preserving data mining; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, D., Aggarwal, C.C., On the design and quantification of privacy preserving data mining algorithms (2001) Proceedings of the 20Th Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), pp. 247-255. , ACM, May; Bertino, E., Fovino, I., Provenza, L., A framework for evaluating privacy preserving data mining algorithms (2005) Data Min.

Four reflectance images were used for the discrimination of six classes - agriculture, livestock, wetland, savannah, forest, and grassland -, for classification of Parque Nacional das Emas and surrounding areas in the state of Goiás, Brazil. The images were segmented for the extraction of sample spectral attributes and application of attribute combinations (mean + mode, all attributes) on data mining. The Weka software was used to construct the decision trees. This methodology indicated that the differentiation among targets increased from the temporal accumulation of the reflectance in all bands and classes, and that the optimal image was that of the sum of the four dates. The classification based on the attribute associations mean + mode showed no restraints in the decision rules processing, unlike the association of all attributes. The mean + mode classification showed a satisfactory accuracy (global accuracy, 69%; Kappa, 58%; and TAU, 63%). The integration of these techniques shows potential to differentiate native and anthropogenic vegetation in the Cerrado.","Anthropization; Mining; Multitemporal analysis; Object-based analysis; Remote sensing; Supervised classification",,,,,,,,,"Antunes, R.R., Bias, E.S., Brites, R.S., Da Costa, G.A.O.P., Desenvolvimento de técnica para monitoramento do cadastro urbano baseado na classificação orientada a objetos.

The strategies included: Taxonomic generalization, training by field observations, training set expansion, and the use of different data mining algorithms. Four matrices were developed, differentiated by the volume of data for machine learning and by soil taxonomic levels to be predicted. The performance of the machine learning algorithms-Random Forest, J48, and MLP-, associated with discretization, class balancing, variable selection, and expansion of the training set was evaluated. Class balancing, variable discretization by equal frequencies, and the Random Forest algorithm showed the best performances. The representativeness extension of field observations, that assumes a larger training area, brought no predictive gain. Soil taxonomic generalization to the suborder level reduces the fragmentation of mapped polygons and improves the accuracy of digital soil maps. When generated by training on in situ soil observations at the mapping area, digital soil maps are as accurate as those trained on preexistent maps.","Classification algorithms; Digital soil map; Predictive variables of the terrain; Soil map accuracy",,,,,,,,,"Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32; Bui, E.N., Moran, C.J., A strategy to fill gaps in soil survey over large spatial extents: An example from Murray-Darling basin of Australia (2003) Geoderma, 111, pp. 21-44; (2004) CARTA geológica do Brasil ao milionésimo: Belo Horizonte: Folha SE-23, , Brasília, DF: Companhia de Pesquisas e Recursos Minerais, 1 mapa.

An algorithm was built to look to the nearest MUX image for each Landsat image, based on user defined time span. The algorithm checks for cloud contaminated pixels on the Landsat time series using Fmask and replaces them with CBERS-4 MUX to build the integrated time series (Landsat-8 OLI+CBERS-4 MUX). Phenological features were extracted from the time series samples for each method (EVI and NDVI original time series and multi-sensor time series, with and without filtering) and subjected to data mining using Random Forest classification. In general, we observed a slight increase in the classification accuracy when using the proposed method. The best result was observed with the EVI integrated filtered time series (78%), followed by the filtered Landsat EVI time series (76%). © 2016 National Institute for Space Research INPE.

This disorder can be diagnosed by non-invasive examinations, such as electroencephalography, whose records are called electroencephalograms (EEG). The EEG can be stored in medical databases for reusing in future. In these data, one can apply data mining process supported by machine learning techniques in order to find patterns that can be used for building predictive models. This paper presents an application of the cross-correlation technique and the kNN algorithm for classification in a set with 200 EEG segments in order to differentiate normal and epileptic (abnormal) signals. The results were evaluated using 10-fold crossvalidation and contingency table methods. With the evaluation using cross validation, it was not found statistically significant difference for classification using kNN. The contingency table results found that the kNN with k = 1 and k = 7 performed better for classifying abnormal and normal EEG, respectively. Also, the kNN with k = 1 and k = 7 were more likely to correctly classify normal and abnormal EEG, respectively. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Bioelectric phenomena; Data mining; Electrophysiology; Learning systems; Medical computing; Nearest neighbor search; Neurology; Cross correlation techniques; Data mining process; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning techniques; Neurological disorders; Predictive models; Statistically significant difference; Electroencephalography",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES

Risk pregnancy accompaniment is essential to reduce these complications. Decision support systems (DSS) are important tools to patients' accompaniment. These systems provide relevant information to health experts about clinical condition of the patient anywhere and anytime. In this paper, a model that uses the Naïve Bayesian classifier is introduced and its performance is evaluated in comparison with the Data Mining (DM) classifier named J48 Decision Tree. This study includes the modeling, performance evaluation, and comparison between models that could be used to assess pregnancy complications. Evaluation analysis of the results is performed through the use of Confusion Matrix indicators. The founded results show that J48 decision tree classifier performs better for almost all the used indicators, confirming its promising accuracy for identifying hypertensive disorders on pregnancy. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Obstetrics; Trees (mathematics); Bayesian classifier; Clinical conditions; Confusion matrices; Decision support system (dss); Decision tree classifiers; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 207706/2014-0

The new sensors are increasingly suited to urban studies, due to the enhancement in spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. Urban environments present high heterogeneity, which cannot be tackled using pixel-based approaches on high resolution images. Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) has been consolidated as a methodology for urban land use and cover monitoring; however, classification of high resolution images is still troublesome. This study aims to assess the improvement on ceramic roof classification using WorldView-2 images due to the increase of 4 new bands besides the standard ""Blue-Green-Red-Near Infrared"" bands. Our methodology combines GEOBIA, C4.5 classification tree algorithm, Monte Carlo simulation and statistical tests for classification accuracy. Two samples groups were considered: 1) eight multispectral and panchromatic bands, and 2) four multispectral and panchromatic bands, representing previous high-resolution sensors. The C4.5 algorithm generates a decision tree that can be used for classification; smaller decision trees are closer to the semantic networks produced by experts on GEOBIA, while bigger trees, are not straightforward to implement manually, but are more accurate. The choice for a big or small tree relies on the user's skills to implement it. This study aims to determine for what kind of user the addition of the 4 new bands might be beneficial: 1) the common user (smaller trees) or 2) a more skilled user with coding and/or data mining abilities (bigger trees). In overall the classification was improved by the addition of the four new bands for both types of users.","C4.5; Ceramic roof; Classification accuracy; Decision tree; GEOBIA; Geographical data mining; WorldView-2","Ceramic materials; Decision trees; Image classification; Infrared devices; Intelligent systems; Land use; Mine roof control; Monte Carlo methods; Remote sensing; Roofs; Semantics; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; C4.5; Classification accuracy; GEOBIA; Geographical data; Worldview-2; Data mining",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

However, usually, there is a lack of time devoted to proper elicitation during software construction. We assume information from similar projects is a valuable knowledge for requirements engineers when facing a new project in the same or related domain, and its acquisition can be speeded up by knowing their main features.

Recent studies using genome-wide association analysis have identified genes and variations that correlate human phenotype within phenotype prediction programs. Benefiting from such post-genomics outcomes, we catalogued genes that have been associated with each of the four conditions before searching for confluence of any two or three conditions, and the confluence of genes concomitantly involved in all phenotypes. Bioinformatics analyses were performed using multi-relational data mining techniques to cover sequence, structure and functional/clinical features.We used high-confidence predictions for gene functional classification analyses for better phenotyping DOISm confluence. Our curated panel of 1439 DOISm genes and a subset of 217 confluent genes represents a platform to assist in dissecting complex nutritional phenotypes. Our repertoire of human genes likely to be involved in DOISm is an attempt to guide further subtyping of complex phenotypes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Analysis association; Bioinformatics; Complex phenotyping; Core-meta analysis; Diabetes; DOISm; Inflammation; Metabolic syndrome; Nutrigenomics; Obesity","Bioinformatics; Biomedical engineering; Computer aided diagnosis; Data mining; Dissection; Medical problems; Metabolism; Nutrition; Pathology; DOISm; Inflammation; Meta analysis; Metabolic syndromes; Nutrigenomics; Obesity; Phenotyping; Genes",,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, FUNCAP

So we propose to use a data mining technique to help us in this task. As a case of study, we analyzed the brain's behaviour of blind people and sighted people in a spatial activity. There is a common belief that blind people compensate their lack of vision using the other senses. If an object is given to sighted people and we asked them to identify this object, probably the sense of vision will be the most determinant one. If the same experiment was repeated with blind people, they will have to use other senses to identify the object. In this work, we propose a methodology that uses decision trees (DT) to investigate the difference of how the brains of blind people and people with vision react against a spatial problem. We choose the DT algorithm because it can discover patterns in the brain signal, and its presentation is human interpretable. Our results show that using DT to analyze brain signals can help us to understand the brain's behaviour. © 2016 Narusci S.

Its estimation tends to be a complex process, owing to the diversity of factors affecting it. One of those factors is property location, which embraces the geographic relationship between the property and the surrounding local amenities. Hedonic modelling is frequently applied to estimate the value of a property; to consider the influence of property location within such models, the region under analysis is usually divided into homogeneous areas. This division can introduce a bias (a particular vision) related to the modifiable areal unit problem. Our intent in this paper is to apply data mining techniques to address a possible valuer bias, a particular valuer's vision, in the current City of Calgary assessment model. Employing the decision tree technique, one locational attribute (Sub-Neighbourhood) was represented by the (x, y) coordinates of the properties, with approximately 96% correct classification with respect to their City of Calgary sub-neighbourhood designation. By adopting the regression tree technique, we show that it is possible to explain approximately 73% variability of the Sale Price attribute, using only the attribute Sub-Neighbourhood or the (x, y) coordinates as input. In general, the results showed a consistent relationship between property value and location. Additionally, the sale price patterns of actual properties do not conform strictly to the politico-administrative units adopted by the city. Those patterns usually cross the unit boundaries limits or are mixed inside a unit. Our results suggest that using a property's spatial coordinates, instead of political-administrative subdivisions, to express its location, would lead to more accurate results and not incur the possibility of bias. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.","Canada; Data mining; Econometry; Economic appraisal; House price; Local government; Locational influence; Neighbourhood; Property assessment; Real estate market; Regression trees; Spatial analysis","data mining; econometrics; housing market; identification method; location-allocation model; neighborhood; property market; residential location; Alberta; Calgary; Canada",,,,,,,,"Anselin, L., Local indicators of spatial association-lisa (1995) Geographical Analysis, 27 (2), pp. 93-115; Anselin, L., Syabri, I., Kho, Y., Geoda: An introduction to spatial data analysis (2006) Geographical Analysis, 38 (1); Boxall, P.C., Chan, W.H., McMillan, M.L., The impact of oil and natural gas facilities on rural residential property values: A spatial hedonic analysis (2005) Resource and Energy Economics, 27 (3), pp. 248-269. , http://www.sciencedirect.com; (2009) The City of Calgary Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2009, , Calgary The City of Calgary, Tech. rep; Camara, G., Souza, R., Freitas, U., Garrido, J., SPRING: Integrating remote sensing and GIS by object-oriented data modelling (1996) Computers & Graphics, 20 (3), pp. 395-403; Fayyad, U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, , Fayyad U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P.

However, to define the correct spatial relevance of physiognomical features remains a great challenge. It has been proposed recently, with promising results, a statistical spatial mapping technique that highlights the most discriminating facial features using some task driven information from data mining. Such priori information has been employed as a spatial weighted map on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), that uses Chi-Square distance as a nearest neighbour based classifier. Intending to reduce the dimensionality of LBP descriptors and improve the classification rates we propose and implement in this paper two quad-tree image decomposition algorithms to task related spatial map segmentation. The first relies only on split step (top-down) of distinct regions and the second performs the split step followed by a merge step (bottom-up) to combine similar adjacent regions. We carried out the experiments with two distinct face databases and our preliminary results show that the top-down approach achieved similar classification results to standard segmentation using though less regions. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

It is known that depending on the content of research that is carried out through a ""seeker"" (""search engine"") on the Internet, the result may fall short of the desirable, in terms of quantity and quality of the sites returned. The Dominance principle, subsequent to treatment of the collected information (unstructured data) on the Internet, aimed at revealing patterns (or logical rules) on a set of information and showed how a web content search can become more effective at a significant universe of information. Other techniques and tools have been applied to mining content on the Web, and as shown in this study. The choice of the Dominance principle associated to Rough Set Theory as Multi-criteria decision technique is due to the possibility of inaccurate data (inconsistent) and the need for treatment of these inaccuracies when processing an information system (data table) under a mathematical perspective, and do not need a history of these data. The use of Rough Set Theory and the Dominance principle associated with the probabilistic relationship between conditions and decisions in decision algorithms, is showed by the possibility of there being uncertain data to yield an essential set of effectively consistent information. © 2016 The Author(s).","Dominance principle; Multi-criteria analysis; Rough set theory; Web mining","Data mining; Decision tables; Decision theory; Internet; Search engines; Set theory; World Wide Web; Decision algorithms; Dominance principle; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria approach; Multicriteria decision; Techniques and tools; Unstructured data; Web Mining; Rough set theory",,,,,"305732/2012-9","The work leading up to this paper was partially supported by CNPq/Brazil, through Research Project n. 305732/2012-9.

Bandeirantes, 3900, Monte Alegre, Ribeirão Preto - SP, CEP 14040-901, Brazil","In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering using community detection in complex networks. Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This provides little information about the places where people are infected, the truly important information for disease control. The recent availability of spatial data generated by geotagged social media posts offers a unique opportunity: by identifying and following diseased individuals, we obtain a collection of sequential geo-located events, each sequence being issued by a social media user. The sequence of map positions implicitly provides an estimation of the users’ social trajectories as they drift on the map. The existing data mining techniques for spatial cluster detection fail to address this new setting as they require a single location to each individual under analysis. In this paper we present two stochastic models with their associated algorithms to mine this new type of data. The Visit Model finds the most likely zones that a diseased person visits, while the Infection Model finds the most likely zones where a person gets infected while visiting. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed models by applying them to more than 100 million geotagged tweets from Brazil in 2015. In particular, we target the identification of infection hot spots associated with dengue, a mosquitotransmitted disease that affects millions of people in Brazil annually, and billions worldwide. We applied our algorithms to data from 11 large cities in Brazil and found infection hot spots, showing the usefulness of our methods for disease surveillance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Disease surveillance; Hot spots; Social media; Spatial cluster detection; Trajectories","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Disease control; Health risks; Learning systems; Monitoring; Social networking (online); Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Trajectories; Disease surveillance; Health surveillances; High-risk zones; Hot spot; Infection models; Single location; Social media; Spatial cluster; Stochastic models",,,,,,,,"https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview; http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/denguenet; Bhatt, S., The global distribution and burden of dengue (2013) Nature, 496, pp. 504-507; Chen, F., Neill, D.B., Non-parametric scan statistics for event detection and forecasting in heterogeneous social media graphs (2014) Proceedings of the 20Th ACM SIGKDD Conference, pp. 1166-1175; Duczmal, L., Assunção, R., A simulated annealing strategy for the detection of arbitrarily shaped spatial clusters (2004) Comput.

Text classification systems, capable of handling such different structures, may facilitate the work of important tasks such as indexation and information retrieval in search engines. The objective of this research is to develop a method for the classification of documents into multiple categories with fuzzy logic. This method was built from a process of pattern recognition and, also, two variables called similarity and accuracy were used. The proposed fuzzy classification method uses variables that express the ability to analyze the similarity and accuracy of a document through a database of terms. The database of terms is generated by a collection of pre-classified documents in categories of interest. The documents processed according to the similarity and accuracy in the database of terms composes a training set also called knowledge base. From this database, it is possible to identify a pattern that specifies a set of rules through a knowledge discovery process. This process involves the data mining of the knowledge base. Thus, it was possible to define a general model that is used in the creation of rules and membership functions of the fuzzy model for the classification of documents into multiple categories. The general model of the rules identified in the data mining process and implemented in fuzzy model considers the most significant variables and also contributes to the specification of the membership functions, such as the definition of linguistic terms of fuzzy sets. Thus, it was possible to implement a more deterministic approach regarding the input, membership functions and inference rules of the fuzzy model. The results of the proposed method for classification of documents are relevant because they have a satisfactory accuracy rate. © 2016 Beatriz Wilges, Gustavo Mateus, Silvia Nassar, Renato Cislaghi and Rogério Cid Bastos.","Decision tree; Fuzzy modeling; Text categorization",,,,,,,,,"Baker, L.D., McCallum, A.K., Distributional clustering of words for text classification (1998) Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 96-103. , Aug. 24-28, Melbourne, Australia; Bang, S.L., Yang, J.D., Yang, H.J., Hierarchical document categorization with k-NN and conceptbased thesauri (2006) Inform.

Information flows among organizational entities, sectors, areas and employees represent possible low process interoperability risks as well as noncompliance risks between business rules and actual process deliveries. Besides this complexity, the Brazilian healthcare area has a notorious problem in its public and private health care systems. These problems are of structural, organizational and financial natures, reflecting the low value attributed to quality and to the actual services in recent surveys of Instituto Data Folha and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Ministério da Saúde).

In this case, it is extremely difficult to have control over all stages of the development process. Many researchers have approached ways to identify aspects, whether social or technical, that have some impact on the success or failure of software. Despite the large number of results found, there is still no consensus among which types of attributes have a greater success impact. Thus, after identifying technical and socio-technical factors that influence the success of OSS using data-mining techniques in about 20.000 projects data from GitHub, this study aims to compare them in order to identify those which most influence in determining the success of an OSS project. The results show that it is possible to identify the status (active or dormant) in more than 90% of the cases based, mainly, in social attributes of the project. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Classification methods; Development process; Social attributes; Social factor; Sociotechnical; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Brito E Abreu, F., Pereira, G., Sousa, P., A coupling-guided cluster analysis approach to reengineer the modularity of object-oriented systems (2000) Proceedings of Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, CSMR 2000, pp. 13-22. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC; Lee, M.S., Moore, A., Efficient algorithms for minimizing cross validation error (1994) Proceedings of 11Th International Confonference on Machine Learning, pp. 190-198. , Cohen, W.

These websites provide some functionality without costs, such as: creation/ edition of communities and social networks; it provides support to a large variety of multimedia contents (e.g. audio and video) and support to interactive communications (e.g. chats and post). Twitter's users post comments about a range of subjects, such as, products, famous persons and politics. The dissemination of the information in these social networks should be considered due to their global coverage. An important functionality of Twitter is the support to georeferenced posts making the localization of posts possible. In this paper, we propose an approach to make the Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining. Our approach is based on Mining Web and of Opinion, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Machine Learning in order to recover relevant information from tweets. The information recovered follows our approach is essential to provide support to the verification of population trends, e.g. in politics domain. We propose a prototype that makes the analysis of population trends, in special, Brazil's politic context and the impeachment process in course.","Geographic information system; Machine learning; Opinion analysis; Opinion mining; Twitter; Web mining","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information systems; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Audio and video; Interactive communications; Multimedia contents; Opinion analysis; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Web Mining; Big data",,,,,,,,"Arel, I., Rose, D.C., Karnowski, T.P., Deep machine learning -A new frontier in artificial intelligence research [research frontier] (2010) Computational Intelligence Magazine, IEEE, 5 (4), pp. 13-18. , Nov; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach.

However, it has several relevant applications, some of them latent yet. One of the first and most decisive steps in this information extraction process is the recognition of relevant words in texts. This article presents a comparative study of methods and tools for recognizing relevant words on microblog posts. Among several analyzed tools, five have been selected for experments with 100,000 tweets. These experiments showed high variability of the results generated by different tools, suggesting a need for improvements.","Natural language processing tools; Relevant words recognition; Social media data; Text mining","Character recognition; Distributed computer systems; Information systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Tellurium compounds; Comparative studies; Micro-blog; Microblogs; Relevant words recognition; Social media; Social media datum; Text mining; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Habib, M.B., Keulen, V.M., (2014) Information Extraction for Social, media, , ACL; Jurafsky, D., Martin, J.H., (2008) Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, , 2nd Ed.

In many sentiment analysis practical scenarios, it is necessary to classify reviews in rates between 1 to 5 stars – a multiclass problem. In literature, we found that the best results for reviews classification are those who propose solutions based on binary splits, achieving accuracies above 90 %. As such, we propose a model, based on the Nested Dichotomies algorithm, that performs multiclass classification in successive steps of binary classification operations. For this classifier to be more effective, we propose that the first split should be defined by identifying users’ recommendation threshold. We present a case study in which this classification model is applied to a set of subjective data extracted from TripAdvisor, discuss the process of determining the first split and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Human centered design; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bins; Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Binary classification; Classification models; Human-centered designs; Multi-class classification; Multi-class problems; Nested dichotomies; Sentiment analysis; User reviews; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Constantinides, E., Romero, C.L., Boria, M.A.G., Social media: A new frontier for retailers?

The quality of the coffee is evaluated through of sensory test known as cup test, besides the numerical score, tasters can describe using comments and the predominant features. The goal of this study was to characterize sensorially the coffees produced in the Matas de Minas region (Minas Gerais, Brasil), from the comments of the tasters, in two sun exposure face. Sensory quality data of coffees were obtained of 14 municipalities in the region of Matas de Minas, for this were evaluated 234 sample points. The exposed faces studied were Soalheira (exposure to afternoon sunlight) and Noruega (exposure to morning sunlight). In each sample point were collected 3 kg of coffee cherries for subsequent sensory analysis, which was done by three tasters, using the methodology of the CoE (Cup of Excellence) improved by BSCA (Brazil Specialty Coffee Association). In order to analyse the comments we used the Content Analysis Method. In general, it can be observed that independent of the sun exposure face can produce specialty coffee in the region of Matas de Minas. In the faces that were studied the coffees were described with floral or citric aromas, intermediate sweetness, remarkable acidity, prolonged aftertaste, caramel flavor and creamy.","Agriculture; Crop properties; Food materials","Agriculture; Data mining; Sensory analysis; Sensory perception; Coffee cherries; Content analysis method; Crop properties; Food materials; Minas Gerais; Sensory qualities; Sensory tests; Sun exposures; Quality control",,,,,,,,"Alves, E.A., Análise da variabilidade espacial da qualidade do café cereja produzido em região de montanha (2005) MS Diss.

With the increasing interest in this theme, several methods have been proposed in the literature. Recent efforts have showed that there is no single method that always achieves the best prediction performance for different datasets. Additionally, novel methods have not being extensively compared with other methods and across different datasets, specially methods that are not designed to the English language. Consequently, researchers tend to accept any popular method as a valid methodology to measure sentiments, a practice that is usual in science. In this context, we propose iFeel 2.0, an online web system that implements 19 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods and allows users to easily label a dataset with all of them. iFeel aims at easing the comparison of new methods with baseline approaches and can also be helpful for those interested in using sentiment analysis, allowing them to choose an appropriate sentiment analysis method that works fine for a new dataset. We also incorporate a multiple language feature to allow methods designed for specific languages to be easily compared with a baseline approach that simply translates the input data to English and run these 19 methods. We hope this system can represent an important contribution to this field. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

More specifically, we tackle the problem of identifying the most common topics in a context of Information Technology audits performed in Brazil since 2011. In order to tackle this problem, we compare two different approaches, supervised and unsupervised learning. On the one hand, the supervised learning approach generated a model that achieved around 73% accuracy for seven categories using random forest. On the other hand, the unsupervised learning approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated a model with five topics, which was considered the best model based on the validation performed by the subject matter experts (SME) from CGU. Nevertheless, it is important to note that both approaches, although implemented independently, generated very similar topics. This also reinforces the success in identifying the main problems found during all these years of IT auditing at CGU using consistent and well-known knowledge discovery methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Auditing; Classification; IT; LDA; Text mining; Topic modeling","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Government data processing; Information systems; Statistics; Supervised learning; Text processing; Unsupervised learning; Auditing; Knowledge discovery method; Latent dirichlet allocations; Subject matter experts; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Supervised learning approaches; Text mining; Topic Modeling; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Alejo, R., Valdovinos, R., Garca, V., Pacheco-Sanchez, J., A hybrid method to face class overlap and class imbalance on neural networks and multi-class scenarios (2013) Pattern Recogn.

In this paper we present a proof of concept for an automatic model of complaints screening, using text mining. Through a complaints link of the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) site, citizens have access to a form to file their complaints. These complaints must be screened and delivered to one of 64 CGU's coordination by subject. Nowadays the complaints screening is done manually. Considering the complaints storage on the database now and the arrival of new complaints, combined with the time spent on manual sorting, the timely analysis of the reported occurrences it becomes increasingly difficult. We compare two approaches: supervised learning with classifiers algorithms and unsupervised leaning with topic modeling and text search. The best results were achieved using ranking based on the Huffman Tree algorithm. This proof of concept demonstrated the feasibility of automatic sorting without the loss of quality compared to manual sorting. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Trees (mathematics); Automatic modeling; Automatic sorting; Large amounts; Manual sorting; Proof of concept; State-of-the-art technology; Text classification; Topic Modeling; Information use",,,,,,,,"(2008) SEMMA and CRISP-DM: A Parallel Overview, , Azevedo Ana Isabel Rojão Lourenco.

However, a deeper review of the literature has failed to present techniques dealing with database information techniques capable of obtaining classifications for school performance; nor is there a consensus regarding the definition of ""educational quality"". To address the situation, in this paper, we propose a methodology that fits the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process to classify teaching in schools. This is done by comparing the grades of the ""Prova Brasil"", which is part of the Development Index of Basic Education (IDEB) in Brazil. To illustrate the methodology, it was applied to 17public elementary schools in the municipality of Araucária, located in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Parana state. The grades achieved by all students of the initial years (1st to 5th year of fundamental teaching) and final years (6th to 9th years of fundamental teaching) were considered. In the Data Mining phase, the main phase of the KDD process, three techniques were used comparatively: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Genetic Algorithms. Those techniques presented acceptable results in classifying each school represented by a ""Performance Classification Label"". Based on this label, the educational managers can have a greater input for procedures to be adopted in each school, and thus set more accurate targets.","KDD process; Pattern recognition; Real case study; School performance","Data mining; Education; Genetic algorithms; Managers; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Classification labels; Database information; Educational qualities; Elementary schools; Knowledge discovery in database; Metropolitan regions; Real case; School performance; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Abari, A.A.F., Yarmohammadian, M.H., Esteki, M., (2011) Assessment of Quality of Education a Non-governmental University Via SERVQUAL Model, 15, pp. 2299-2304. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.097, Procedia: Social and Behavioral Sciences; Ansary, A., Jayashree, A., Malarvizhi, C.A.N., The effect of gender and nationality on service quality in Malaysian higher education (2014) Journal of Developing Areas, 48 (4), pp. 97-118. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jda.2014.0076; Benaim, M., A model for the evaluation of instructional methods (1984) IEEE Transactions on Education, E, 27 (2), pp. 105-108; Birenbaum, M., Evaluating the assessment: Sources of evidence for quality assurance (2007) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 33 (1), pp. 29-49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2007.01.004; Brasil, (2010) Ministério da Educação.

The data can present noises and contain sparse patterns hide in a huge amount of information. The knowledge extracted from environmental sensor data can have many applications: indicate climate changes, risk of ecologic catastrophes and help to determine environment degradation in face of humans actions. However, there is a lack of methods that can handle this kind of data. Based on that, we proposed IncMSTS-PP: an incremental algorithm that finds sequential sparse patterns and enhances them semantically facilitating the interpretation. IncMSTS-PP implements STW-method to extract stretchy patterns (patterns with time gaps) in data with noises. The enhancement use post-processing method that generalizes the patterns using the fuzzy ontology knowledge. Our experiment shows that IncMSTS-PP extracts 2.3 times more relevant sequences than traditional algorithms in sensor domain. The post-processing summarizes the patterns reducing to 22.47% of the original number of patterns. In conclusion, IncMSTS-PP is efficient and reliable in the extraction of significant sequences from sensor data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Data mining; Fuzzy ontology; Real data; Sequence generalization","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Extraction; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Processing; Amount of information; Environmental sensor; Fuzzy ontology; Incremental algorithm; Postprocessing methods; Real data; Sequence generalization; Sequential patterns; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Glossary of Meteorology, , Digital, novembro 2012. amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=rain1; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., (1994) Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases, pp. 487-499. , Bocca, J.B., Jarke, M., Zaniolo, C.

As found by the analysis of data collected in this investigation, teachers agree that conceptual modeling contributes to the organization of the geographic knowledge of students. And yet it was evident the use of concept maps as a teaching and learning strategy, as well as an evaluation tool for student performance. Finally, the use of concept maps in teaching Geography brings up the idea of the development and exercise of autonomy by the students, since self-study is one of the essential factors for meaningful learning of spatial content in classroom.","Conceptual modeling; Learning strategy; Teaching-learning","Data mining; Education; Learning systems; Personnel training; Students; Conceptual model; Educational systems; Learning strategy; Science and Technology; Student performance; Teaching and learning strategy; Teaching-learning; Teaching-learning process; Teaching",,,,,,,,"Álvarez Méndez, J.M., (2002) Avaliar para Conhecer: Examinar Para Excluir, , Porto Alegre: Artmed; Boruchovitch, E., Estratégias de aprendizagem e desempenho escolar: Considerações para a prática educacional (1999) Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica, 12, p. 2. , http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-79721999000200008&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt, Porto Alegre.

There are research centers that collect, store and create indexes of agricultural activities, providing multidimensional time series composed by years of data. In this paper, we are interested in studying the behavior of these time series, especially in what regards the evolution of agricultural price indexes over the years. We explore data mining techniques tailored to analyze temporal data, aiming to generate spatio-temporal trajectories of grains price indexes for six years of data. We propose the use of Tucker decomposition to both analyze the temporal patterns of these price indexes and map trajectories that represent their behavior over time in a concise and representative low-dimensional subspace. The case study presents an application of this methodology to real databases of price indexes of corn and soybeans in Brazil and the United States. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Grain market; Spatio-temporal trajectories; Tucker decomposition","Agriculture; Commerce; Data mining; Grain (agricultural product); Time series; Trajectories; Agricultural activities; Behavior dynamics; Low-dimensional subspace; Multidimensional time series; Spatio-temporal trajectories; Temporal pattern; Tensor decomposition; Tucker decompositions; Costs; agricultural market; agricultural price; agroindustry; data mining; database; decomposition analysis; maize; soybean; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; trajectory; Brazil; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT: SFRH/BD/81339/2011","Márcia D.B.

However, its quadratic time complexity may hamper its use, mainly in the analysis of large time series data. All the recent advances in speeding up the exact DTW calculation are confined to similarity search. However, there is a significant number of important algorithms including clustering and classification that require the pairwise distance matrix for all time series objects. The only techniques available to deal with this issue are constraint bands and DTW approximations. In this paper, we propose the first exact approach for speeding up the all-pairwise DTW matrix calculation. Our method is exact and may be applied in conjunction with constraint bands. We demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the runtime in approximately 50% on average and up to one order of magnitude in some datasets.

We investigate the capabilities of an incremental version of the Optimum-Path Forest classifier (OPF-CI) in the context of learning new classes and compare its behavior against Support Vector Machines and k Nearest Neighbours classifiers. The OPF-CI classifier is a parameter-free, graphbased approach to incremental training that runs in linear time with respect to the number of instances. Our results show OPF-CI keeps the running time low while producing an accuracy behavior similar to the other classifiers for increments of instances. Also, it is robust to variations on the order of the learned classes, demonstrating the applicability of the method. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Nearest neighbor search; Active Learning; Concept drifts; Data stream mining; Incremental learning; Incremental training; K-nearest neighbours; Multi-class models; Optimum-path forests; Forestry",,,,,,,,"Ausiello, G., Italiano, G.F., Marchetti Spaccamela, A., Nanni, U., Incremental algorithms for minimal length paths (1991) Journal of Algorithms, 12 (4), pp. 615-638; José Carmona-Cejudo, M., Baena-García, M., Del Campo-Ávila, J., Morales Bueno, R., Bifet, A., Gnusmail: Open framework for on-line email classification (2010) ECAI, pp. 1141-1142; Cauwenberghs, G., Poggio, T., Incremental and decremental support vector machine learning (2000) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 13, pp. 409-415; Chin, F., Houck, D., Algorithms for updating minimal spanning trees (1978) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 16 (3), pp. 333-344; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Di Mauro, N., Esposito, F., Ferilli, S., Maria Altomare Basile, T., A backtracking strategy for order-independent incremental learning (2004) ECAI, 16, p. 460; Gama, J., Žliobaitě, I., Bifet, A., Pechenizkiy, M., Bouchachia, A., A survey on concept drift adaptation (2014) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 46 (4), p. 44; Geng, X., Smith-Miles, K., Incremental learning (2015) Encyclopedia of Biometrics, pp. 912-917; Giraud-Carrier, C., A note on the utility of incremental learning (2000) AI Communications, 13 (4), pp. 215-223; Hassani, M., Spaus, P., Cuzzocrea, A., Seidl, T., Adaptive stream clustering using incremental graph maintenance (2015) Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming Models and Applications, pp. 49-64; Kulis, B., Basu, S., Dhillon, I., Mooney, R., Semi-supervised graph clustering: A kernel approach (2009) Machine Learning, 74 (1), pp. 1-22; Kuzborskij, I., Orabona, F., Caputo, B., From n to n+ 1: Multiclass transfer incremental learning (2013) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3358-3365; Papa, J.P., Falcão, A.X., De Albuquerque, V.H.C., Tavares, J.M.R.S., Efficient supervised optimum-path forest classification for large datasets (2012) Pattern Recognition, 45 (1), pp. 512-520; Papa, J.P., Falcão, A.X., Suzuki, C.T.N., Supervised pattern classification based on optimum-path forest (2009) International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 19 (2), pp. 120-131; Ponti, M., Nazare, T.S., Thume, G.S., Image quantization as a dimensionality reduction procedure in color and texture feature extraction (2016) Neurocomputing, 173, pp. 385-396; Ponti, M., Picon, C.T., Color description of low resolution images using fast bitwise quantization and border-interior classification (2015) IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 1399-1403; Ponti, M., Riva, M., (2016) An Incremental Linear-time Learning Algorithm for the Optimum-path Forest Classifier, , arxiv Preprint, arxiv:1604.03346 cs.

Recently, studies have shown that most of existing algorithms for learning from data streams do not encompass techniques for a specific kind of drift: feature drifts. Feature drifts occur when features become, or cease to be, relevant to the learning task. In this paper, we propose an extension to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, so its distances' computations are weighted according to their current discriminative power. On our proposal, the discriminative power of features is given by entropy, which is swiftly computed over a sliding window. Empirical evidence shows that our approach is able to overcome several existing algorithms in accuracy and feature drift adaptation, while at the expense of bounded processing time and memory space. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Discriminative power; Dynamic features; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Processing time; Sliding Window; Weighted k-nearest neighbors; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,"Barddal, J.P., Gomes, H.M., Enembreck, F., SFNClassifier: A scalefree social network method to handle concept drift (2014) Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC), Ser.

In such domains, the occurrence of situations in which instances of a type are specializations of another type is recurrent. This recurrent phenomenon is known in the conceptual modeling community as the powertype pattern. The relevance of the powertype pattern has led to its adoption in many important modeling initiatives, including the UML. To address the challenge of multi-level modeling, we have proposed an axiomatic well-founded theory called MLT. In this paper, we demonstrate how MLT can be used as a reference theory for capturing a number of nuances related to the modeling of the powertype pattern in conceptual modeling. Moreover, we show how this theory can be used to analyze, expose limitations and redesign the UML support for modeling this pattern. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Conceptual modeling; Multi-level modeling; Powertype; UML","Information systems; Systems engineering; Conceptual model; Multilevel model; Multilevels; Multiple Classification; Powertype; Reference theory; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Halpin, T., Morgan, T., (2008) Information Modeling and Relational Databases, , Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco; Recker, J., Rosemann, M., Green, P., Indulska, M., Do ontological deficiencies in modeling grammars matter?

Such setting is not uncommon, but the literature lacks results on it. We used two techniques to create more balance between classes: under-sampling and over-sampling the target corpora. Doc2Vec achieved the best result overall on the skewed classes, but performed poorly over small and sampled configurations. RNTN achieved the best result on the over-sampled corpus. The Naive Bayes baseline was not surpassed in the under-sampled corpus with Pos/Neg classes, which was the smallest corpus configuration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Computational linguistics; Naive bayes; Over sampling; Sentiment analysis; Under sampled; Under-sampling; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Alm, C.O., Roth, D., Sproat, R., Emotions from text: Machine learning for textbased emotion prediction (2005) Proceedings of the Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 579-586; Araújo, M., Gonçalves, P., Benevenuto, F., Measuring sentiments in online social networks (2013) Proceedings of the 19th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, pp. 97-104; Brum, H., Kepler, F., Análise de sentimentos para português brasileiro usando redes neurais recursivas (2015) IV Workshop De Iniciação Cientifica Em Tecnologia Da Informação E Da Linguagem Humana (Tilic); Manning, C.D., Surdeanu, M., Bauer, J., Finkel, J., Bethard, S.J., McClosky, D., The stanford CoreNLP natural language processing toolkit (2014) Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pp. 55-60; Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet: A publicly available lexical resource for opinion mining (2006) Proceedings of LREC, 6, pp. 417-422; Freitas, C., Motta, E., Milidiú, R., César, J., (2012), Vampiro que brilha.. r´a!

Support Vector Machines classification coupled with non-lemmatized selection of verbs and nouns, adjectives and adverbs was the best approach, with 87.3% maximum accuracy. Straightforward lemmatization in Portuguese led to the lowest classification results in the group, with 85.3% and 81.7% precision in SVM and Naive Bayes respectively.

This type of message has been considered the target of sentiment analysis in many recent studies, since they represent a rich source of opinionated texts. Thus, in order to determine the opinion expressed in tweets, different studies have employed distinct strategies, which mainly include supervised machine learning methods. For this purpose, different kinds of features have been evaluated. Despite that, none of the state-of-the-art studies has evaluated distinct categories of features, regarding their similar characteristics. In this context, this work presents a literature review of the most common feature representation in Twitter sentiment analysis. We propose to group features sharing similar aspects into specific categories. We also evaluate the relevance of these categories of features, including meta-level features, using a significant number of Twitter datasets. Furthermore, we apply important and well-known feature selection strategies in order to identify relevant subsets of features for each dataset.

Buzzwords are fashionable words that continue gaining popularity until a tipping point is reached and then their popularity declines. Our goal in this study is to identify buzzwords through their frequency of occurrence over the years, using two clustering techniques: k-means and the self-organizing map (SOM). We also used the DBLP database to run experiments with data from published papers in an attempt to find terms that could be classified as buzzwords, in accordance with the defined meaning. Clusters generated by both k-means and SOM are very similar, indicating that it is very likely that buzzwords were correctly identified as such. We were able to identify terms such as ""android"" and ""mapreduce"", which were clearly buzzwords for 2012, as well as terms such as ""pomdp"", which was not an obvious buzzword. As a contribution, we highlight common characteristics identified for buzzwords and make comparisons between the two methods for finding buzzwords which were analyzed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, the problem of incomplete datasets in the hierarchical classification scenario must be solved using unsupervised missing value imputation methods due to the lack of supervised methods to deal with the hierarchical context. Thus, in this work, we propose and evaluate a supervised missing value imputation method for datasets used in hierarchical classification problems in which the classes are organized into tree structure. Experiments were performed on incomplete datasets to evaluate the effect of the proposed missing value imputation method on classification performance when using a global hierarchical classifier. The results showed that, using the proposed method for dealing with missing attribute values, it provided higher classifier predictive performance than other unsupervised missing value imputation methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Data mining; Hierarchical classification; Missing attribute value imputation","Autocorrelation; Data mining; Trees (mathematics); Attribute values; Classification performance; Hierarchical classification; Hierarchical classifiers; Missing value imputation; Pre-processing step; Predictive performance; Supervised methods; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Han, J., Kamber, M., (2011) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques: Concepts and Techniques, , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Little, R.J., Rubin, D.B., Statistical Analysis with Missing Data (2002) Probability and Statistics, 1. , 2nd edn.

However, the huge amount of alerts that an IDS triggers and their low-level representation make the alerts analysis a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on hierarchical clustering that supports intrusion alert analysis in two main steps. First, it correlates historical alerts to identify the most typical strategies attackers have used. Then, it associates upcoming alerts in real time according to the strategies discovered in the first step. The experiments were performed using a real data set from the University of Maryland. The results show that the proposed approach can provide useful information for security administrators and may reduce the time between a security event and the response.","Alert correlation; Data mining; Intrusion detection; Security management","Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Industrial management; Information systems; Information use; Network security; Alert correlation; Hier-archical clustering; Intrusion alert correlation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Low level representation; Security administrator; Security management; University of Maryland; Intrusion detection",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A., Hadgkiss, J., Ruighaver, A.B., Incident response teams - challenges in supporting the organisational security function (2012) Comput.

In this context, a lot of effort has been put on the extraction of useful patterns from streaming scenarios. Learning from data streams embeds a variety of problems, and by far, the most challenging is concept drift, i.e. changes in data distribution. In this paper, we focus on a specific type of drift uncommonly assessed in the literature: feature drifts. Feature drifts occur whenever a subset of features becomes, or ceases to be, relevant to the concept to be learned. We propose and review several feature drifting data stream generators and use them to benchmark state-of-the-art data stream classification algorithms and their combination with drift detectors. Results show that, although drift detectors enable slight quicker recovery to feature drifts, best results are obtained by Hoeffding Adaptive Tree, the only learner that performs dynamic feature selection as streams progress. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Feature extraction; Concept drifts; Data distribution; Data generation; Data stream classifications; Drift detectors; Dynamic feature selections; State of the art; Useful patterns; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Silva, J.A., Faria, E.R., Barros, R.C., Hruschka, E.R., Carvalho, D.A.C.P.L.F., Gama, J.A., Data stream clustering: A survey (2013) ACM Comput.

In addition, it can help to study critical music artists that are in the top rankings and why. With the emergence of new ways in which communities are exposed to music, we see the need to reassess how the popularity of an artist is measured. It is noticed that traditional popularity rankings that model artists based only on disk sales and runs on the radio are not sufficient. The presence of numerous web services that allow user interaction in the world of music, whether listening online or watching the life of an artist more closely in digital media, has changed the dynamics of the music industry. Thus, this work proposes a methodology for music artists comparison based on how they perform on different music digital media available on the web. The methodology is also prepared to allow input data from mass media, so that a study case is presented using the TV media in order to properly assess the popularity of artists. Our case study shows that relevant rankings of music artists can be revealed by employing the proposed methodology. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Data mining; Digital media; Rankings","Data mining; Digital storage; Exposed to; Input datas; Mass media; Music industry; Popularity ranking; Rankings; Study case; User interaction; Web services",,,,,,,,"Azarite, D.M.R., (2012) Monitoramento E Métricas De Mídias Sociais, 1St Edn, , DVS, São Paulo; Bryan, N.J., Wang, G., Musical influence network analysis and rank of samplebased music (2011) Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2011, pp. 329-334. , Florida, Miami; Chelaru, S., Rodriguez, C., Altingovde, I., (2013) How Useful is Social Feedback for Learning to Rank YouTube Videos?, pp. 997-1025. , 2nd edn.

Even that, they are categorized by data models. A model associated with the data can promote better strategies for persistence and manipulation of data in the target database. Based on this motivation, the purpose of this paper is to present an approach for logical design of NoSQL document databases that consists a process that converts a conceptual modeling into efficient logical representations for a NoSQL document database. The authors also evaluate their approach and demonstrate that the generated NoSQL logical structures reduce the amount of data items accessed by queries. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents an approach for logical design of NoSQL document database schemas based on a conceptual schema. The authors generate compact and redundancy-free schemas and define appropriate representations in a NoSQL document logical model. The estimated volume of data and workload information can be considered to generate optimized NoSQL document structures. Findings - This approach was evaluated through a case study with an experimental evaluation in the e-commerce application domain. The results demonstrate that the authors' workload-based conversion process improves query performance on NoSQL documents by reducing the number of database accesses. Originality/value - Unlike related work, the reported approach covers all typical conceptual constructs, details a conversion process between conceptual schemas and logical representations for NoSQL document database category and, additionally, considers the estimated database workload to perform optimizations in the logical structure. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is promising. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Extended entity-relationship; NoSQL data modeling; NoSQL document database; NoSQL logical design; Web databases; Workload-driven approach","Data mining; Database systems; Logic design; Query processing; Document database; Entity-relationship; Logical design; Web database; Workload-driven approach; Structural design",,,,,,,,"Atzeni, P., Jensen, C.S., Osri, G., Ram, S., Tanca, L., Torlone, R., The relational model is dead, SQL is dead, and i don't feel so good myself (2013) SIGMODRecord, 42 (2), pp. 64-68; Batini, C., Ceri, S., Navathe, S.B., (1992) Conceptual Database Design: An Entity-Relationship Approach, , Benjamin/Cummings, San Francisco, CA; Bugiotti, F., Cabibbo, L., Atzeni, P., Torlone, R., (2014) Database Design for NoSQL Systems, pp. 223-231. , ER 2014; Cattell, R., Scalable SQL and NoSQL data stores (2010) SIGMOD Record, 39 (4), pp. 12-27; Chebotko, A., Kashlev, A., Lu, S., A big data modeling methodology for apache Cassandra (2015) International Congress on Big Data, pp. 238-245. , IEEE; Elmasri, R., Navathe, S.B., (2011) Fundamentals of Database Systems, , Addison-Wesley, Boston, MA; Evans, E., (2003) Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, , Addison-Wesley Professional, Boston, MA; Teiid, J., (2015) MongoDB Translator, , https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/teiid812final/MongoDB-Translator, available at: (accessed 3 September 2015; Jovanovic, V., Benson, S., Aggregate data modeling style (2013) SAIS, 2013, pp. 70-75; Kaur, K., Rani, R., Modeling and querying data in NoSQL databases (2013) International Conference on Big Data, pp. 1-7. , IEEE, Silicon Valley, CA; Lima, C., Mello, R.S., A workload-driven logical design approach for NoSQL document databases (2015) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services (IiWAS), 15. , ACM, New York, NY; McMurtry, D., Oakley, A., Sharp, J., Subramanian, M., Zhang, H., (2013) Data Access for Highly-scalable Solutions: Using SQL, NoSQL, and Polyglot Persistence, , www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspxid-40327, Microsoft available at: (accessed 5 June 2014; Mok, W.Y., Embley, D.W., Generating compact redundancy-free xml documents from conceptual-model hypergraphs (2006) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18 (8), pp. 1082-1096; Mongo, D.B., (2015) RDBMS to MongoDB Migration Guide, , www.mongodb.com/collateral/rdbms-mongodb-migration-guide, available at (accessed 3 September 2015); Sadalage, P.J., Fowler, M.J., (2013) NoSQL Distilled, , Addison-Wesley, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Schroeder, R., Mello, R.S., Improving query performance on XML documents: A workload-driven design approach (2008) DocEng, 2008, pp. 177-186; Schroeder, R., Duarte, D., Mello, R.S., A workload-aware approach for optimizing the XML schema design trade-off (2011) IiWAS, 2011, pp. 12-19. , ACM, New York, NY","Lima, C.; Federal University of Santa CatarinaBrazil; email: claudio.lima@ufsc.br",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,17440084,,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, clustering is applied with partitioning-clustering techniques, specifically, Partitioning around Medoids (PAM) to analyse load curves from a city of South-eastern Brazil in São Paulo state. A top-down approach in time granularity is performed to detect and to label profiles which could be affected by seasonal trends and daily/hourly time blocks. Time-granularity patterns are useful to support the improvement of activities related to distribution, transmission and scheduling of energy supply. Results indicated four main patterns which were post-processed in hourly blocks by using shades of grey to help final-user to understand demand thresholds according to the meaning of dark grey, light grey and white colours. A particular and different behaviour of load curve was identified for the studied city if it is compared to the classical behaviour of urban cities. © 2016 Brazilian Operations Research Society.","Clustering; Data mining; Electricity consumption; Load curves; Patterns; Time granularity",,,,,,,,,"Ahat, M., Amor, M., Bui, A., Bui, G., Guérard, G., Petermann, C., Smart Grid and Optimization (2013) American Journal of Operations Research, 3 (1), pp. 196-206; Amjady, N., Day-Ahead Price Forecasting of Electricity Markets by a New Fuzzy Neural Network (2006) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 21 (2), pp. 887-896; Bhat, A., K-Medoids Clustering Using Partitioning Around Medoids for Performing Face Recognition (2014) International Journal of Soft Computing, Mathematics and Control, 3 (3), pp. 1-12; Candelieri, A., Conti, D., Capellini, D., Archetti, F., Urban Water Demand Characterization and Short-term forecasting – the ICEWater Approach (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hydroinformatics, , Paper 250, New York, USA; Carpinteiro, O.A.S., Reis, A.J., A SOM-based Hierarchical Model to Short-Term Load Forecasting (2005) IEEE Power Tech, pp. 1-6; Chicco, G., Napoli, R., Piglione, F., Comparisons Among Clustering Techniques for Electricity Customer Classification (2006) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 21 (2), pp. 933-940; Conejo, A.J., Plazas, M.A., Espíndola, R., Molina, A.B., Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting Using the Wavelet Transform and ARIMA Models (2005) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20 (1), pp. 1035-1042; Dent, I., Aickelin, U., Rodden, T., (2011) The Application of a Data Mining Framework to Energy Usage Profiling in Domestic Residences Using UK Data.

One of SkyServer data access interfaces allows users to enter ad-hoc SQL statements to query the catalog. SkyServer also presents some template queries that can be used as basis for more complex queries. This interface has logged over 330 million queries submitted since 2001. It is expected that analysis of this data can be used to investigate usage patterns, identify potential new classes of queries, find similar queries, etc. and to shed some light on how users interact with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and how scientists have adopted the new paradigm of e-Science, which could in turn lead to enhancements on the user interfaces and experience in general. In this paper we review some approaches to SQL query mining, apply the traditional techniques used in the literature and present lessons learned, namely, that the general text mining approach for feature extraction and clustering does not seem to be adequate for this type of data, and, most importantly, we find that this type of analysis can result in very different queries being clustered together. © 2016 SPIE.","SQL; Text Mining; Web Logs","Feature extraction; Surveys; User interfaces; Complex queries; Internet portals; Scientific education; Sloan Digital Sky Survey; Text mining; Traditional techniques; Usage patterns; Weblogs; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Madrid, J.P., MacChetto, D., High-Impact astronomical observatories (2009) Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, 41, pp. 913-914. , Jan; Alam, S., Albareti, F.D., Allende Prieto, C., Ers, F., Erson, S.F., Erton, T., Rews, B.H., Bailey, S., The eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey: Final Data from SDSS-III (2015) The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 219, p. 12. , (July; Szalay, A.S., Gray, J., Thakar, A.R., Kunszt, P.Z., Malik, T., Raddick, J., Stoughton, C., VandenBerg, J., The SDSS skyserver: Public access to the sloan digital sky server data (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data], SIGMOD '02, pp. 570-581. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Thakar, A., Szalay, A., Kunszt, P., Gray, J., Migrating a multiterabyte archive from object to relational databases (2003) Computing in Science & Engineering, 5 (5); Raddick, M.J., Thakar, A.R., Szalay, A.S., Santos, R.D., Ten Years of SkyServer I: Tracking web and SQL e-Science Usage (2014) Computing in Science & Engineering, 16 (4); Raddick, M.J., Thakar, A.R., Szalay, A.S., Santos, R.D., Ten Years of SkyServer II: How astronomers and the public have embraced e-Science (2014) Computing in Science & Engineering, 16 (4); Singh, V., Gray, J., (2007) PRESQL: Prior Repeated Execution of SQL, , Unpublished Report; Makiyama, V.H., (2015) Text Mining Applied to SQL Queries: A Case Study for SDSS SkyServer, , Master's thesisInstituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), S~ao Josfie dos Campos (2015-09-21; Makiyama, V.H., Raddick, J., Santos, R.D.C., Text mining applied to SQL Queries: A case study for the SDSS skyserver (2015) CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 1478, pp. 66-72. , SIMBig], Ventura, J.

The automatic detection of tactile paving surface is one important topic of research, not only to help the mobility of visually impaired persons, but also for use in the displacement of autonomous robots, providing a safely route and warnings. In this paper we propose an approach for tactile paving surface detection in realtime with the purpose to assist visually impaired persons. It uses computer vision algorithms combined with decision tree to eliminate some possible false alarms. We assume the visually impaired persons holds a smartphone, which is used to obtain images, as well as to assist him by audio feedback to keep it on the tactile paving surface. This problem is very challenging, mainly due to illumination changes, occlusion, image noise and resolution, as well as different possible colors of the tactile paving surfaces. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach works well in low resolution images, effectively detecting the tactile paving surfaces in real test scenarios. © The Authors.

However, the mere availability of such information in government portals does not ensure an effective increase in the degree of transparency of these entities, because the large volume of data combined with the lack of standards makes it impossible any systematic monitoring of such data. This paper suggests the application of parallel programming techniques based on mapreduce programming paradigm to the identification of a predetermined set of products purchased by the Public Administration. It also proposes a way to consolidate this information to make easy viewing of disparities found in the large volume of data presented. The proposed solution was tested in a case study performed in the Transparency Portal of the Federal Government. The results suggest that the presented techniques constitute a promising approach to issues related to transparency areas, which normally handles large volumes of data, but it does not always provide quality information.","Big data; Public transparency; Text mining","Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Information systems; Parallel programming; Public administration; Tellurium compounds; Transparency; Federal governments; Government entities; Large volumes; Map-reduce programming; Programming technique; Public expenditures; Quality information; Text mining; Big data",,,,,,,,"Agner, L., (2008) Governo Eletrônico E Transparência do Estado, , Revista Webinsider, Brasília; (1988) CONSTITUIÇÃO da REPÚBLICA FEDERATIVA do BRASIL de, , http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicaocompilado.htm, BRASIL., [Internet].

The performance is considered to be the difference between the yield of a given block and the average yield of the homogeneous group that it belongs to. The methods available to identify these outstanding blocks are usually subjective. The aim of this study was to propose an objective and repeatable approach to identify outstanding performance blocks. The proposed approach consisted of performance determination, using regression trees, and the classification of these blocks by k-means clustering. This approach was illustrated using a sugarcane model. The main factors influencing the tonnes of cane per hectare (TCH) and total recoverable sugar (TRS) yields were found to be crop age and water availability during ripening, respectively. These were used to create potential yield groups, and blocks with high and low performance were identified. The proposed approach was found to be valid in the identification of outstanding sugarcane blocks, and it can be applied to different crops or in the context of precision agriculture. © 2016 Journal of the Brazilian Association of Agricultural Engineering.","Clustering; Regression tree; Yield variability",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP

The proposed approach aims at contributing to the semiodiscoursive study regarding the construction of the ethos (identity) of this media universe, which has become a central part of the modernday lives of millions of people. To achieve this goal, we apply state-of-the-art computational methods for (1) automatic emotion recognition from facial expressions, (2) extraction of modulations in the participants' speeches and (3) sentiment analysis from the closed caption associated to the videos of interest. More specifically, we compute features, such as, visual intensities of recognized emotions, field sizes of participants, voicing probability, sound loudness, speech fundamental frequencies and the sentiment scores (polarities) from text sentences in the closed caption. Experimental results with a dataset containing 520 annotated news videos from three Brazilian and one American popular TV newscasts show that our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 84% in the sentiments (tension levels) classification task, thus demonstrating its high potential to be used by media analysts in several applications, especially, in the journalistic domain. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This research used data from interactions in a social network to identify the sentiments involved in each student comment. From the collected text different methods of sentiment analysis were used in order to identify which method had better results compared to the real ones. The comparison showed differences between these results and the real ones: While the used tools classified more than 40% of the comments as neutral, the analysis of the messages' author showed that 71% of the comments were positive. In the classification, the occurrence of outliers was identified as well as differences on the intensity of the sentiments acquired with each method. No approach, including the one performed by one of the researchers, was considered efficient enough as the highest level of accuracy obtained was less than 70%.","Cognitive information systems; Emotions; Online social networks; Sentiment analysis","Cognitive systems; Data mining; Information systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Analytical method; Cognitive information; Emotions; Human analysis; Human feelings; On-line social networks; Sentiment analysis; Distributed computer systems",,,,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Chen, H., Salem, A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages: Feature selection for opinion classification in Web forums (2008) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 26 (3), p. 12; Ahmed, K., El Tazi, N., Hossny, A.H., Sentiment Analysis over Social Networks: An Overview; Altrabsheh, N., Cocea, M., Fallahkhair, S., Learning sentiment from students' feedback for real-Time interventions in classrooms (2014) Adaptive and Intelligent Systems, pp. 40-49. , Springer International Publishing; Araújo, M., Métodos para análise de sentimentos no Twitter (2013) Proceedings of the 19th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMedia'13); Bosco, C., Patti, V., Bolioli, A., Developing corpora for sentiment analysis: The case of irony and senti-Tut (2013) IEEE Intelligent Systems, (2), pp. 55-63; Cambria, E., Hussain, A., (2015) Sentic Computing: A Common-sense-based Framework for Concept-level Sentiment Analysis, 1. , http://www.sentic.net/sentic-computing.pdf, Springer.

Can it be done in real time? For example, how to cluster decades of frequent measurements of tens of climatic attributes to aid real time alert systems in forecasting extreme climatic events, such as floods and hurricanes? The task of clustering data with many attributes is known as subspace clustering. Today, there exists a need for algorithms of this type well-suited to process multidimensional data streams, for which real time processing is highly desirable. This paper proposes the new algorithm Haliteds - a fast, scalable and highly accurate subspace clustering algorithm for multidimensional data streams. It improves upon an existing technique that was originally designed to process static (not streams) data. Our main contributions are: (1) Analysis of Data Streams: the new algorithm takes advantage of the knowledge obtained from clustering past data to easy clustering data in the present. This fact allows our Haliteds to be considerably faster than its base algorithm, yet obtaining the same accuracy of results; (2) Real Time Processing: as opposed to the state-of-the-art, Haliteds is fast and scalable, making it feasible to analyze streams with many attributes and high frequency of events in real time; (3) Experiments: we ran experiments using synthetic data and a real multidimensional stream with almost one century of climatic data. Our Haliteds was up to 217 times faster than 5 representative works, i.e., its base algorithm plus 4 others from the state-of-the-art, always presenting highly accurate results.

Companies as Google and Facebook are on the list of the largest companies in the world. Investment on advertising and pages creation for dissemination of advertisements and brands has led Facebook to an outstanding position in this scenario. In this context, this study aims to analyze and predict the number of interactions in news published in five fan pages, which are the most accessed at the Facebook social network in Brazil. As a contribution is proposed to determine the impact factor of publications, considering the average of three mentioned features, the number of likes, the number of comments and the number of times that the news was shared. Results of different techniques of classification will be evaluated, beyond the influence of characteristics related to words and more frequent terms.","Data Mining; Prediction; Social Networks","Forecasting; Marketing; Social networking (online); Classification algorithm; Facebook; Impact factor; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Buza, K., Feedback prediction for blogs (2012) The 36th Annual Conference of the German Classification Society on Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 1-3. , Hildesheim, Germany.

To rapidly and timely detect in real-time these spatial clusters, algorithms explored grid-based approaches, which segments the spatial domain into discrete cells. The primary benefit of this approach is that it switches the costly distance comparison of density-based algorithms to counting the number of moving objects mapped to each cell. However, during this process, the algorithm may fail to identify clusters of spatially and temporally close moving objects that get mapped to adjacent cells. To overcome this answer loss problem, we propose a density heuristic that is sensible to moving objects in adjacent cells. The heuristic further subdivides each cell into inner slots. Then, we calculate the density of a cell by adding the object count of the cell itself with the object count of the inner slots of its adjacent cells, using a weight function. To avoid collateral effects and detecting incorrect clusters, we apply the heuristic only to transient cells, that is, cells whose density are less than, but close to the density threshold value. We evaluate our approach using real-world datasets and explore how different transient thresholds and the number of inner slots influence the similarity and the number of detected, correct and incorrect, and undetected clusters when compared to the baseline result. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Answer loss on-line spatial clustering; On-line clustering; On-line grid-based spatial clustering; On-line spatial clustering","Algorithms; Big data; Cells; Cytology; Data mining; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Collateral effects; Density-based algorithm; Grid-based approach; Heuristic approach; Online-clustering; Real-world datasets; Spatial clustering; Streaming algorithm; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 557128/2009-9, 442338/2014-7, 303332/2013-1

With reference to the knowledge generated by Last.fm users, this work investigates the co-occurrence of items in radio station programs, that is, whether the radio playlists represent cohesive sets of related items. In this sense, we developed an analysis methodology in which frequent item sets containing artists, songs, and musical genres that co-occur within radio programs are extracted, in order to analyze the similarity among discovered item sets, using as reference the similarity lists from Last.fm. Experimental results show that the more strict the filters applied to define the set of frequent items are, the more items present in the Last.fm similarity lists are found. On the other hand, the study also reveals that new correlations between items, even though not classified by Last.fm, can be discovered, showing that even large-scale collaborative systems as Last.fm are not complete regarding data characterization for extracting abstract similarity concepts.","Data mining; Music; Similarity analysis","Distributed computer systems; Filtration; Information systems; Radio broadcasting; Radio stations; Co-occurrence analysis; Data characterization; Frequent item sets; Large scale collaborative systems; Music; Music Recommendation System; New correlations; Similarity analysis; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 1215, pp. 487-499. , VLDB; Bu, J., Tan, S., Chen, C., Wang, C., Wu, H., Zhang, L., He, X., Music recommendation by unified hypergraph: Combining social media information and music content (2010) Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia, MM '10, pp. 391-400. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Geleijnse, G., Schedl, M., Knees, P., The quest for ground truth in musical artist tagging in the social web era (2007) International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), pp. 525-530. , Citeseer; Hong, J., Deng, H., Yan, Q., Tag-based artist similarity and genre classification (2008) IEEE International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling Workshop, pp. 628-631. , 2008.

When using such models, improved predictions are often attained with the input of extra variables provided by the use of proximal sensors, such as magnetometers and portable X-ray fluorescence scanners (pXRF). This work aimed to evaluate the efficiency of such tools for mapping soil classes and properties in tropical conditions. Soils were classified and sampled at 39 locations in a regular-grid design with a 200-m distance between samples. A pXRF and a magnetometer were used in all samples, and DTM values were obtained for every sampling site. Through visual analysis, boxplots were used to identify the best variables for distinguishing soil classes, which were further mapped using fuzzy logic. The map was then validated in the field. An ordinary least square regression model was used to predict sand and clay contents using DTM, pXRF and the magnetometer as predicting variables. Variables obtained with pXRF showed a greater ability for predicting soil classes (overall accuracy of 78% and 0.67 kappa index), as well as for estimating sand and clay contents than those acquired with DTM and the magnetometer. This study showed that pXRF offers additional variables that are key for mapping soils and predicting soil properties at a detailed scale. This would not be possible using only DTM or magnetic susceptibility. © 2016 by the authors.","Data mining; Fuzzy logics; Magnetic susceptibility; Ordinary least square multiple linear regression; Portable X-ray fluorescence scanner","Data mining; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Linear regression; Magnetic susceptibility; Magnetometers; Mapping; Scanning; Soil surveys; X ray spectrometers; X rays; Digital soil mappings; Digital terrain model; Multiple linear regressions; Ordinary least squares; Overall accuracies; Portable x-ray fluorescence; Proximal sensing; Tropical conditions; Soils",,,,,,,,"Dos Santos, W.J.R., Curi, N., Silva, S.H.G., da Fonseca, S., da Silva, E., Marques, J.J., Detailed soil survey of an experimental watershed representative of the Brazilian Coastal Plains and its practical application (2014) Ciênc.

However, it is more concise than free text and may limit specialists’ descriptions of important findings not covered by pre-defined structures. A computational ontological structure derived from free texts designed by specialists may be a solution for this problem. Therefore, the goal of our study was to develop a methodology for structuring information in radiology reports covering specifications required for the Brazilian Portuguese language, including the terminology to be used. Methods: We gathered 1,701 radiological reports of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the lumbosacral spine from three different institutions. Techniques of text mining and ontological conceptualization of lexical units extracted were used to structure information. Ten radiologists, specialists in lumbosacral MRI, evaluated the textual superstructure and terminology extracted using an electronic questionnaire. Results: The established methodology consists of six steps: 1) collection of radiology reports of a specific MRI examination; 2) textual decomposition; 3) normalization of lexical units; 4) identification of textual superstructures; 5) conceptualization of candidate-terms; and 6) evaluation of superstructures and extracted terminology by experts using an electronic questionnaire. Three different textual superstructures were identified, with terminological variations in the names of their textual categories. The number of candidate-terms conceptualized was 4,183, yielding 727 concepts. There were a total of 13,963 relationships between candidate-terms and concepts and 789 relationships among concepts. Conclusions: The proposed methodology allowed structuring information in a more intuitive and practical way. Indications of three textual superstructures, extraction of lexicon units and the normalization and ontologically conceptualization were achieved while maintaining references to their respective categories and free text radiology reports. © Schattauer 2016.","Free-text; Ontology; Radiological report; Structured report; Terminology","controlled vocabulary; data mining; human; natural language processing; nomenclature; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; questionnaire; radiology; research; Data Mining; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Natural Language Processing; Radiology; Research Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled",,,,,,,,"Brentari, D., (1998) A Prosodic Model of Sign Language Phonology, , First edition, MIT Press, Cambridge; Reis, A.K.O., The interfaces of lexicon disciplines (2010) Dialogia, 9, pp. 173-179; Pavel, S., Nolet, D., (2002) Terminology Manual, , https://linguisticadocumentaria.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/pavel-terminologia.pdf, Public Works and Government Services.

Soil maps were used at the scale of 1:50,000, for the watersheds of the rivers Santo Cristo and Arroio Portao, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and the extrapolation was done using the ""Simple Cart"" decision tree algorithm, trained in the previously mapped areas. The watersheds were divided into two parts, one used for model training and the other for model validation. From the digital elevation model Aster-GDEM, seven maps of soil predicting variables in the landscape were generated. Sampling was random and performed with sampling density of three points per hectare. Model training was performed in the Weka software, and model accuracies were calculated using the error matrix. For both watersheds, the overall accuracy of the predicted soil map was higher in the training area than in the validation area, and showed values of 50 and 54%. The maps produced by the predictive model showed acute differences in the spatial distribution of mapping units, compared with the original soil map, indicating that the used digital mapping technique has low effectivity for the extrapolation of pre-existing soil maps to other physiographically similar areas.","Data mining; Decision trees; Geographic information system; Overall accuracy; Pedometrics; Simple cart",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, M., Hook, S., Ramachandran, B., (1999) ASTER users handbook, p. 93. , Pasadena: JPL; Beven, K.J., Kirkby, M.J., A physically based, variable contributing area model of basin hydrology (1979) Hydrological Sciences Bulletin, 24, pp. 43-69; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., (1984) Classification and regression trees, , Belmont: Wadsworth International Group; Ten Caten, A., Dalmolin, R.S.D., De Pedron, F.A., Ruiz, L.F.C., Da Silva, C.A., An apropriate data set size for digital soil mapping in Erechim, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (2013) Revista Brasileira de Ciência do Solo, 37, pp. 359-366; Ten Caten, A., Dalmolin, R.S.D., De Pedron, F.A., De Santos, M.L.M., Componentes principais como preditores no mapeamento digital de classes de solos (2011) Ciência Rural, 41, pp. 1170-1176; Congalton, R.G., A review of assessing the accuracy of classifications of remotely sensed data (1991) Remote Sensing of Environment, 37, pp. 35-46; Figueiredo, S.R., (2006) Mapeamento supervisionado de solos através do uso de regressões logísticas múltiplas e sistema de informações geográficas, p. 92. , Dissertação (Mestrado)-Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre; Giasson, E., Sarmento, E.C., Weber, E., Flores, C.A., Hasenack, H., Decision trees for digital soil mapping on subtropical basaltic steeplands (2011) Scientia Agricola, 68, pp. 167-174; Grinand, C., Arrouays, D., Laroche, B., Martin, M.P., Extrapolating regional soil landscape from an existing soil map: Sampling intensity, validation procedures, and integration of spatial context (2008) Geoderma, 143, pp. 180-190; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Witten, I.H., The WEKA Data Mining Software: An update (2009) SIGKDD Explorations, 11, pp. 10-18; Hasenack, H., Weber, E., (2010) Base cartográfica vetorial contínua do Rio Grande do Sul-escala 1:50.000, , Porto Alegre: UFRGS, Instituto de Biociências, Centro de Ecologia. 1 DVD.

This work develops a multiresolution time series method for extracting patterns in weather records, particular temperature data. The topic is important, as, given a warming climate, morbidity andmortality are expected to rise as heatwave frequency and intensity increase. By analysing summer temperature quantiles at different levels of coarseness, it was found that compounding models can contain a complete description of severe weather events. This new multiresolution quantile approach is developed as an extension of the symbolic aggregate approximation of the temperature time series in which quantiles are computed at every stretch of the piecewise partition. The process is iterated at different scales of the partition, and it was found to be a very useful approach for finding patterns related to both heatwave periods and intensities. The method is successfully tested using real weather records from Brazil (Recife) and the UK (London), and it was found that in both locations heatwave intensity and frequency are increasing at a substantial rate. In addition, it was found that the rate of increase in intensity of the heatwaves is far outstripping the rate of increase in mean summer temperature: by a factor of 2 in Recife and a factor of 6 in London. The approach will be of use to those looking at the impact of future climates on civil engineering, water resources, energy use, agriculture and health care, or those looking for sustained extreme events in any time series. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, a deeper review of the literature has failed to present techniques dealing with database information techniques capable of obtaining classifications for school performance; nor is there a consensus regarding the definition of ""educational quality"". To address the situation, in this paper, we propose a methodology that fits the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process to classify teaching in schools. This is done by comparing the grades of the ""Prova Brasil"", which is part of the Development Index of Basic Education (IDEB) in Brazil. To illustrate the methodology, it was applied to 17 public elementary schools in the municipality of Araucária, located in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Parana state. The grades achieved by all students of the initial years (1st to 5th year of fundamental teaching) and final years (6th to 9th years of fundamental teaching) were considered. In the Data Mining phase, the main phase of the KDD process, three techniques were used comparatively: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Genetic Algorithms. Those techniques presented acceptable results in classifying each school represented by a ""Performance Classification Label"". Based on this label, the educational managers can have a greater input for procedures to be adopted in each school, and thus set more accurate targets.","KDD process; Pattern recognition; Real case study; School performance",,,,,,,,,"Abari, A.A.F., Yarmohammadian, M.H., Esteki, M., Assessment of quality of education a non-governmental university via SERVQUAL model (2011) Procedia: Social and Behavioral Sciences, 15, pp. 2299-2304. , 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.097; Ansary, A., Jayashree, A., Malarvizhi, C.A.N., The effect of gender and nationality on service quality in Malaysian higher education (2014) Journal of Developing Areas, 48 (4), pp. 97-118. , 10.1353/jda.2014.0076; Benaim, M., A model for the evaluation of instructional methods (1984) IEEE Transactions on Education, E-27 (2), pp. 105-108; Birenbaum, M., Evaluating the assessment: Sources of evidence for quality assurance (2007) Studies in Educational Evaluation, 33 (1), pp. 29-49. , 10.1016/j.stueduc.2007.01.004; Ministério da Educação.

Due to the high degree of cysteine conservation, novel members from this peptide family can be identified in protein databases through a search through regular expression (REGEX). In this work, six novel cyclotide-like precursors from the Poaceae were identified from NCBI's non-redundant protein database by the use of REGEX. Two out of six sequences (named Zea mays L and M) showed an Asp residue in the C-terminal, which indicated that they could be cyclic. Gene expression in maize tissues was investigated, showing that the previously described cyclotide-like Z. mays J is expressed in the roots. According to molecular dynamics, the structure of Z. mays J seems to be stable, despite the putative absence of cyclization. As regards cyclotide evolution, it was hypothesized that this is an outcome from convergent evolution and/or horizontal gene transfer. The results showed that peptide screening from databases should be performed periodically in order to include novel sequences, which are deposited as the databases grow. Indeed, the advances in computational and experimental methods will together help to answer key questions and reach new horizons in defense-related peptide identification. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","data mining; molecular dynamics; phylogenetic analysis; regular expression","Amino acids; Covalent bonds; Data mining; Gene expression; Gene transfer; Genes; Grain (agricultural product); Molecular dynamics; Pattern matching; Peptides; Proteins; Computational analysis; Convergent evolution; Cyclized peptides; Experimental methods; Horizontal gene transfer; Peptide identification; Phylogenetic analysis; Regular expressions; Database systems; cyclotide; cyclotide; Article; convergent evolution; data mining; gene expression; horizontal gene transfer; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; peptide analysis; phylogeny; plant genetics; Poaceae; protein database; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; structure analysis; amino acid sequence; chemistry; maize; Poaceae; protein database; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Cyclotides; Databases, Protein; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Poaceae; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Zea mays",,"Cyclotides",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

These deposits vary unrelated to obesity, which reinforces its direct segmentation for further quantification. However, manual segmentation of these fats has not been widely deployed in clinical practice due to the required human workload and consequential high cost of physicians and technicians. In this work, we propose a unified method for an autonomous segmentation and quantification of two types of cardiac fats. The segmented fats are termed epicardial and mediastinal, and stand apart from each other by the pericardium. Much effort was devoted to achieve minimal user intervention. The proposed methodology mainly comprises registration and classification algorithms to perform the desired segmentation. We compare the performance of several classification algorithms on this task, including neural networks, probabilistic models and decision tree algorithms. Experimental results of the proposed methodology have shown that the mean accuracy regarding both epicardial and mediastinal fats is 98.5% (99.5% if the features are normalized), with a mean true positive rate of 98.0%. In average, the Dice similarity index was equal to 97.6%. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Atlas; Classification; Computed tomography; Image registration; Machine learning; Segmentation","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Biomineralization; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Decision trees; Deposits; Diseases; Health risks; Heart; Image registration; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Tomography; Atlas; Automated segmentation; Classification algorithm; Coronary artery calcification; Decision-tree algorithm; Manual segmentation; Probabilistic models; Volume quantification; Data mining; classification algorithm; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; decision tree; epicardium; experimental model; heart; mediastinum; model; nervous system; quantitative study; registration; adipose tissue; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery disease; heart; human; medical informatics; pericardium; procedures; radiography; statistics and numerical data; three dimensional imaging; Adipose Tissue; Algorithms; Coronary Artery Disease; Heart; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mediastinum; Medical Informatics; Pericardium; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES","É.

The residual biomass of coffee, originated in the food industry after oil extraction from coffee beans, called coffee beans residual press cake, has attracted interest as a source of compounds with antioxidant activity. This study investigated the chemical composition of aqueous extracts of coffee beans residual press cake (AE), their antioxidant activity, and the effect of topical application on the skin wound healing, in animal model, of hydrogels containing the AE, chlorogenic acid (CGA), allantoin (positive control), and carbopol (negative control). The treatments' performance was compared by measuring the reduction of the wound area, with superior result (p<0.05) for the green coffee AE (78.20%) with respect to roasted coffee AE (53.71%), allantoin (70.83%), and carbopol (23.56%). CGA hydrogels reduced significantly the wound area size on the inflammatory phase, which may be associated with the well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of that compound. The topic use of the coffee AE studied improved the skin wound healing and points to an interesting biotechnological application of the coffee bean residual press cake. © 2016 Regina Celis Lopes Affonso et al.",,"Allantoin; Antioxidants; Data mining; Hydrogels; Oils and fats; Plants (botany); Presses (machine tools); Anti-inflammatory action; Anti-oxidant activities; Beneficial effects; Biotechnological applications; Chemical compositions; Coffee consumption; Phytochemical composition; Topical application; Coffee; allantoin; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; caffeic acid; caffeine; carbomer; catalase; chlorogenic acid; Coffea arabica extract; ferulic acid; hydroxybenzoic acid; plant extract; plant medicinal product; protocatechuic acid; superoxide dismutase; syringic acid; theophylline; trigonelline; unclassified drug; antioxidant; coffee; plant extract; plant medicinal product; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; biomass; cell viability; chemical composition; Coffea arabica; controlled study; DPPH radical scavenging assay; drug efficacy; enzyme activity; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrogel; IC50; LD50; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; skin injury; wound healing; animal; chemistry; coffee; drug effects; pathology; skin; wound healing; Animals; Antioxidants; Coffee; Male; Mice; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts; Skin; Wound Healing",,"allantoin, 97-59-6; caffeic acid, 27323-69-9, 331-39-5; caffeine, 58-08-2; carbomer, 9007-20-9, 9062-04-8; catalase, 9001-05-2; chlorogenic acid, 327-97-9; ferulic acid, 1135-24-6, 24276-84-4; hydroxybenzoic acid, 29656-58-4; protocatechuic acid, 99-50-3; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; syringic acid, 530-57-4; theophylline, 58-55-9, 5967-84-0, 8055-07-0, 8061-56-1, 99007-19-9; trigonelline, 535-83-1; Antioxidants; Coffee; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts",,"Sigma Aldrich, United States","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Considering the consolidation of the internet and the improvement of the interaction, searching, and learning mechanisms, we propose a generic architecture, called CaVa, to create virtual Learning Spaces building up on cultural institution documents. More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. © 2016 The Authors.

In IE domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) are two important tasks. The former aims at finding named instances, as peoplés names, locations, among others, whereas the latter consists detecting and characterizing relations among such named entities in text. Most of the state-of-the-art supervised learning methods for NER and RE relies on statistical machine learning techniques with higher accurate results for NER than RE. These statistical machine learning techniques typically uses a propositional hypothesis space for representing examples, i.e., an attribute-value representation. Such representation presents some limitations particularly to the extraction of complex relations, which demand more semantic resources, and mainly contextual information about the involving instances. In this paper, we present an IE system, named OntoILPER, permitting to extract both entity and relation instances from textual document in english. This system, not only benefits from a domain ontology as semantic resource, but also takes advantage of a higher expressive relational hypothesis space for representing examples whose structure is relevant to the task at hand. OntoILPER induces extraction rules that subsume examples of entities and relation instances from a specific graph-based model of sentence representation. Moreover, the system enables the application of domain ontologies and further ground knowledge in the form of relational features. In addition, this paper presents several experiments with OntoILPER on NER and RE using the TREC reference corpus, and compare these results to other state-of-the-art IE systems. © Lavoisier 2016.","Entity and relation extraction; Inductive logic programming; Ontology population; Ontology-based information extraction; Symbolic machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Data mining; Digital libraries; Graphic methods; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Automatic information extraction; Named entity recognition; Ontology Population; Ontology-based information extraction; Relation extraction; Statistical machine learning; Supervised learning methods; Symbolic machine learning; Inductive logic programming (ILP)",,,,,,,,"Airola, A., Pyysalo, S., Björne, J., Pahikkala, T., Ginter, F., Salakoski, T., All-paths graph kernel for protein-protein interaction extraction with evaluation of cross corpus learning (2008) BMC Bioinformatics, 9, p.

State-of-the-art NERC systems are based on supervised machine learning and hence need to be trained on (manually) annotated corpora. However, annotated corpora hardly exist for non-standard languages and labeling additional data manually is tedious and costly. In this article, we present a novel method to automatically generate (partially) annotated corpora for NERC by exploiting the link structure of Wikipedia. Firstly, Wikipedia entries in the source language are labeled with the NERC tag set. Secondly, Wikipedia language links are exploited to propagate the annotations in the target language. Finally, mentions of the labeled entities in the target language are annotated with the respective tags. The procedure results in a partially annotated corpus that is likely to contain unannotated entities. To learn from such partially annotated data, we devise two simple extensions of hidden Markov models and structural perceptrons. Empirically, we observe that using the automatically generated data leads to more accurate prediction models than off-the-shelf NERC methods. We demonstrate that the novel extensions of HMMs and perceptrons effectively exploit the partially annotated data and outperforms their baseline counterparts in all settings. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Cybernetics; Data mining; Hidden Markov models; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Markov processes; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Accurate prediction; Automatically generated; Baseline counterparts; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Question Answering; State of the art; Supervised machine learning; Big data",,,,,,,,"Altun, Y., McAllester, D., Belkin, M., Maximum margin semi-supervised learning for structured variables (2006) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Altun, Y., Tsochantaridis, I., Hofmann, T., Hidden Markov support vector machines (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning; Atserias, J., Zaragoza, H., Ciaramita, M., Attardi, G., Semantically annotated snapshot of the english wikipedia (2008) Proceedings of the Sixth International Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC, p. 2008. , Marrakech, Morocco.

With the rise of Online Music Streaming Services (OMSSs), large amounts of user behavioral data can be exploited for this task. In this paper, we present SWIFT-FLOWS, an approach that models user listening habits in regards to how user attention transitions between artists. SWIFT-FLOWS combines recent advances in trajectory mining, coupled with modulated Markov models as a means to capture both how users switch attention from one artist to another, as well as how users fixate their attention in a single artist over short or large periods of time. We employ SWIFT-FLOWS on OMSSs datasets showing that it provides: (1) semantically meaningful representation of habits; (2) accurately models the attention span of users. © Figueiredo, Ribeiro, Faloutsos, Andrade, Almeida.",,"Information retrieval; Markov processes; Behavioral data; Large amounts; Markov model; Online business; Online music; Trajectory minings; User attention; Behavioral research",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

The perceived inability of some models to deal with the challenges of processing high-dimensional data, however, limits the accurate characterisation of these subtypes. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset. Findings: In this study, we employed the CM1 score to identify the most discriminative probes for each group, and an ensemble learning technique to assess the ability of these probes on assigning subtype labels using 24 different classifiers. Our analysis is comprised of an iterative computation of these methods and statistical measures performed on a set of over 2000 samples. The refined labels assigned using this iterative approach revealed to be more consistent and in better agreement with clinicopathological markers and patients' overall survival than those originally provided by the PAM50 method. Conclusions: The assignment of intrinsic subtypes has a significant impact in translational research for both understanding and managing breast cancer. The refined labelling, therefore, provides more accurate and reliable information by improving the source of fundamental science prior to clinical applications in medicine. © 2015 Milioli et al.","Breast cancer; Classifiers; CM1 score; Data mining; Ensemble learning; Feature selection; Intrinsic subtypes; METABRIC; Predictor models; Subtype prediction","Article; basal like breast cancer; breast cancer; breast cancer intrinsic subtype; cancer classification; cancer survival; class prediction; classifier; clinicopathological marker; CM1 score; controlled study; data mining; disease marker; ensemble learning; genetic database; HER2 enriched breast cancer; human; inconsistent breast cancer; luminal A breast cancer; luminal B breast cancer; machine learning; normal like breast cancer; overall survival; PAM50 breast cancer intrinsic classifier; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; statistical analysis; statistical concepts; survival rate; survival time; transcriptomics; validation process",,,,,"New South Wales Institute of Psychiatry, NSWIOP: 13/DATA/1-03

As a result of this mineral wealth, the Amazonian ecosystem has been suffering a rapid process of environmental degradation since the sixties. In this sense, given the mining adverse consequences to the environment, Brazilian Constitution obligate the land reclamation of degraded areas by mining and it has been performed by the majority of the mining companies. However, given the environment complexity and its relationship with the biological diversity, there is a great necessity of better understanding in assessment of evolution of these degraded areas in recovery. Thus, the present work had as objective identifying different groups of degraded areas in reclamation process by means of soil texture, biochemistry and vegetation indicators. The data was analyzed through Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Self Organizing Maps (SOMs).

However, a nation's mineral resources can only generate prosperity if specific technology assets are employed in a way as to effectively develop its resource sector, capture value from it, and transform that value into long-term benefits. The roadmap to such an ambitious goal lies in effective management, supported by consistent, formal decision-making methods. Yet, integrating environmental and social goals into strategic, tactical and operational decisions is a complex challenge, often addressed without adequate analytical rigour. We provide a systematic analysis of the literature devoted to the development and application of quantitative decision-support methods with sustainability considerations in the mining industry. By establishing a framework based on the fundamental elements inherent to decision-making processes pertinent to mining operations, we identify several opportunities for advancing research and practice. In particular, we find important gaps in elements such as project portfolio optimization, operations and waste management, and mine closure and rehabilitation, and even more so when social targets and impacts are considered. It is our belief that insights from this discussion could be of significant value to both academics and practitioners interested in promoting sustainable socio-economic development throughout the mining industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The emphasis was on environmental impacts resulting from mineral procedure of rock blasting at open air, which have been little studied. The study area is located in Natal semi-arid region, more precisely in the urban area of Caico-RN city. The research was based on theoretical fundamentals, methodological procedures and primary data obtained from Dantas Gurgel &amp; Cia Ltda. Rock blasting analysis and its environmental impacts included activities from mining to processing of rocks, pointing the main environmental impacts from the perspective of interaction matrix. Then, it was concluded that the most significant environmental impacts resulting from rocks exploitation with explosives in Dantas Gurgel &amp; Cia Ltda., in Caic&#243; city, are connected to blasting phase, and may extend outward of mining area. Among them it is highlighted the ultra-launching, vibration, gases, dust and disease. © 2016 Universidade Estadual Paulista.

This article aims to characterize the geoenvironmental aspects that favored the formation of opal in the county of Pedro II and their respective peculiarities, and to identify the environmental impacts from the extraction process of the gemstone in the areas of Co-op of Prospectors from Pedro II (COOGP) after 2005. The secondary data collection of the survey were based on the analysis of information contained in reports of the National Department of Mineral Production / DNPM and Co-op of Prospectors from Pedro II (COOGP), the primary being harvested in technical visits to mines operated by COOGP, through unstructured interview to his President, and check List application to identify the environmental impacts resulting from extraction of opal. It was found that actions such as removal of vegetation, stripping the land and excavating cause environmental impacts such as erosion, upwelling groundwater and siltation of water resources and require mitigating actions that slow down the effects. © 2016, Universidade Estadual Paulista.

This method, originally developed for metallurgical and geological samples, was modified for the analysis of atmospheric dust and is suitable for TSP and PM10low-volume air samples. Arsenic-bearing particles with an average diameter as small as 1 micrometer can be detected and measured with an analytical throughput of over 10,000 particles per hour. The method provides single particle data on particle size, morphology, elemental composition and mineralogy, and is suitable for both crystalline and non-crystalline phases. The first application of this method to a Brazilian mining town confirmed that the arsenic detected in air is not associated to arsenic-bearing mineral phases excavated at the mine site. This new technique provides crucial data on the source, distribution and potential toxicity of arsenic-bearing atmospheric particles in urban, rural and mining environments. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Air quality; Arsenic; Crystalline materials; Dust; Minerals; Particle size; Sustainable development; Atmospheric dust; Atmospheric particles; Average diameter; Elemental compositions; Geological samples; Mineral liberation analysis; Mining environments; Non-crystalline phasis; Particle size analysis",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

The combined techniques were applied in an open pit iron mine located in Carajás Mineral Province (Brazilian Amazon region), using a set of 33 TerraSAR-X-1 images acquired from March 2012 to April 2013 when, due to a different deformation behavior during the dry and wet seasons in the Amazon region, a non-linear deformation was detected. The DTS analysis was performed on a stack of multi-look unwrapped interferograms using an extension of the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), where a set of additional weighted constraints on the acceleration of the displacement was incorporated to control the smoothness of the time-series solutions, whose objective was to correct the atmospheric phase artifacts. The height errors and the deformation history provided by the DTS technique were used as previous information to perform the PSI analysis. This procedure improved the capability of the PSI technique to detect non-linear movement as well as to increase the numbers of point density of the final results. The results of the combined techniques are presented and compared with total station/prisms and ground-based radar (GBR) measurements. © 2016 by the authors.","DInSAR time-series; Open pit iron mine; PSI; Surface movement","Deformation; Interferometry; Iron; Iron mines; Satellites; Singular value decomposition; Time series; Time series analysis; D-inSAR; Deformation behavior; Nonlinear deformations; Open pit; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Surface movement; SVD(singular value decomposition); Weighted constraints; Open pit mining",,,,,,,,"Gabriel, A.K., Goldstein, R.M., Zebker, H.A., Mapping small elevation changes over large areas: Differential SAR interferometry (1989) J.

Indeed, we claim in this paper that not only the three dimensions must be considered in trajectory data analysis, but that trajectories can be represented from different points of view, that we call multiple aspect representation. Existing works, in general, are limited to one single trajectory representation, what narrows the discovery of several types of interesting patterns. In this vision paper we show that there is a need for a change of paradigm in trajectory data analysis, and present new research challenges in movement analysis. © 2016 National Institute for Space Research INPE.

As consequence of this definition and knowing that data collection of noise is a usual procedure, was established as the main goal of this study to confirm that production cycles can be detected by noise measurements and with this kind of data procedures the productivity can be analysed. Noise levels were collected following law and standard procedures. Sampling occurred al continuously throughout the working cycle on a significant number of cycles. Simultaneously data were collected allowing relating the noise with the operational tasks. Data analysis was performed considering all the obtained data. The detection of noise patterns in the different tasks resulted from data analysis in each one of the octave predefined frequency bands (63 Hz to 8 KHz). It was possible to relate noise patterns and production operations for load and transport carried out by Loaders and by the Dumpers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Data handling; Information analysis; Open pit mining; Pattern recognition; Data collection; Noise measurements; Number of cycles; Operational tasks; Production cycle; Production operations; Standard procedures; Transport operations; Occupational risks",,,,,"BEX 7300/14-0","The authors acknowledge Brazilian government support provided through CAPES/DGU proc.

They can reach aquatic environments as complex mixtures, and single chemical toxicity as a baseline for risk assessment can underestimate the impairment of ecosystems. The aim of the present study was to evaluate combined toxicity of binary mixtures of zinc and nickel to the tropical mysid Mysidopsis juniae. Acute toxicity was assessed and mixture toxicity was modelled using the conceptual models for concentration addition and independent action to predict whether both metals act additively or whether they interact with each other inside the organism. For that, the observed mortality data were compared with the modelled data. For the single toxicity assessment, results showed that nickel induced higher toxicity than did zinc, with lethal concentrations to 50% of the organisms of 180±30gL-1 and 260±40g zinc L-1 respectively. In binary mixtures, both metals acted additively and no interactions were predicted by using the conceptual models. The present study has highlighted the need to fill the gaps in toxicity studies using marine species and approaches that can help improve the assessment of accurate risk in the environment.

Data set evaluation includes statistical analysis of cation and anion concentrations, carried out via a Pearson correlation matrix, principal component analysis (PCA), and estimation of the weighted mean of the volume of precipitation. The HYSPLIT model of tracking atmospheric particles was used to identify the main trajectories of air masses for the rain that fell in the Rio Claro area and the possible interaction of the surface area with the atmosphere. The rain is characteristically slightly acid (pH 4.75 to 6.81) with low electrical conductivity (from 4.12 to 29.3 μS cm-1). Rainwater incorporates elements and compounds from two main sources. HCO3 - originates from atmospheric CO2 produced by plant respiration and present in industrial and vehicle emissions. Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and K+ are directly related to the geology of the region, and specifically to emissions due to mining activities for the ceramic industry around Rio Claro, while NH4 +, NO3 - and Pb2+ can be associated with industrial and vehicle emissions. Despite the multiple origins for the elements within the rainwater, natural sources account for about 40% of the compounds.","Atmospheric pollution; Ceramic industries; Rainwater composition; Rio Claro",,,,,,,,,"Ayres, M., Ayres, M., Jr., Ayres, D.L., Santos, A.S., (2007) BioEstat.

This work presents an investigation of ground deformation measurements based on a combination of DInSAR Time-Series (DTS) and PSI techniques, applied in a large area of open pit iron mines located in Carajás (Brazilian Amazon Region), aiming at detect high rates of linear and nonlinear ground deformation. These mines have presented a historical of instability and surface monitoring measurements over sectors of the mines (pit walls) have been carried out based on ground based radar and total station (prisms). By using a priori information regarding the topographic phase error and phase displacement model derived from DTS, temporal phase unwrapping in the PSI processing and the removal of the atmospheric phases can be performed more efficiently. A set of 33 TerraSAR-X-1 images, acquired during the period from March 2012 to April 2013, was used to perform this investigation. The DTS analysis was carried out on a stack of multi-look unwrapped interferogram using an extension of SVD to obtain the Least-Square solution. The height errors and deformation rates provided by the DTS approach were subtracted from the stack of interferogram to perform the PSI analysis. This procedure improved the capability of the PSI analysis to detect high rates of deformation as well as increased the numbers of point density of the final results. The proposed methodology showed good results for monitoring surface displacement in a large mining area, which is located in a rain forest environment, providing very useful information about the ground movement for planning and risks control. © 2016 SPIE.","Amazon Region; DInSAR time-series; open pit iron mine; PSI; surface deformation; TerraSAR-X","Deformation; Image processing; Interferometry; Iron; Open pit mining; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal processing; Time series; Amazon region; D-inSAR; Open pit; Surface deformation; TerraSAR-X; Iron mines",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Therefore, the authors of this paper have observed that the conclusions of the studies that induced the formulation of these methods, have taken in account the obtained data over models and theoretical laboratory works. The authors agree that the FS (Factor of Safety) is a good and previous indication of the pillar behavior. The Tributary Area concept states that this factor should be obtained by the forces equilibrium relation between the load acting on the supported area by each pillar and their resulting reactive force. Unfortunately this and other evaluations do not consider, as a rule, the discontinuities structural control. The authors of this paper propose an approach to perform these calculations taking into account the effects of the rock mass structural control based on the Mohr-Coulomb and Barton & Bandis criteria. Interesting conclusions about such analyses were reached, since that the failures in these cases are predominantly planar. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Design; Rocks; Room and pillar mining; Safety factor; Structural dynamics; Equilibrium relations; Factor of safety; Laboratory test; Laboratory work; Mohr-Coulomb; Scale effects; Structural control; Underground mine; Rock mechanics",,,,,,,,"Ayres Da Silva, L.A., Ayres Da Silva, A.L.M., Sansone, E.C., The shape effect and rock mass structural control for mine pillar design (2013) EUROCK 2013, Wroclaw.

The discovery of pipes with micro diamonds and/or crater facies kimberlites in the entire Alto Paranaíba Igneous Province (macro region of Abaeté District) enhanced the interest about understanding the diamonds origins. The diamonds from this district usually show few cleavages, present more than 100 carats (ct) and are associated to numerous indicator minerals for kimberlite, suggesting proximity between their primary and current sources. In order to corroborate with the area geophysics knowledge, high resolution maps were prepared using airborne magnetic data integrated with geology and field studies. The products were used to: suggest the continental fracture zones which allowed the ascent of alkaline magma; correlate magnetic responses with stratigraphic and tectonic features; indicate the magnetic responses of the lineaments that govern the diamantiferous drainages; suggest possible kimberlite clan rocks; and estimate the basement depth by Euler Deconvolution. The crystalline basement is concave and the sedimentary rocks thickness may achieve about 3,000 m. The magnetic anomalies selected as possible kimberlite clan rocks were detailed using ground magnetic surveys and their Analytic Signal was adopted to estimate the magnetic source geometries by Euler Deconvolution. These possible kimberlitic pipes look like each other and presenting depths of up to 200 m and diameters of up to 300 m. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Geofísica.","Alto Paranaíba Igneous Province; Euler deconvolution; Mineral prospecting","aeromagnetic survey; basement rock; cleavage; crater; deconvolution; diamond; Eulerian analysis; facies; fracture zone; igneous province; kimberlite; lineament; magma; magnetic anomaly; magnetic method; pipe; sedimentary rock; Alto Paranaiba; Brazil; Minas Gerais",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

The company was created by the state during the Second World War, and organized as a company town, until 1993, when it was privatized. In the last 20 years, the CSŃs internal and international market, strategies and innovation efforts have changed deeply. The research question was if the steel business is still the core business and what CSŃs position in the global raw material production and steel market? This work combines exploratory and descriptive researches approach. The theory of networks of production and the Triple Helix approach were applied to interpret geo-economic relations resulting from the globalization process. Regarding the technical procedure, this is a case study. The data presented was a result of two different researches done in the last five years. The first one was a documental research, based on official CSŃs documents, as annual reports and interviews with actual and former employers with managerial level. The second one shows the patent data extracted from FAMPAT database, using Questel Orbit and VantagePoint software. It was identified and analyzed 336 applications from 1971 and 2009. Since 2000, CSN started to make investments with the aim of adapting the model of sell goods and services, which ceases to be strictly domestic and turns global. The company did: acquisitions in Brazil and abroad; modernization production process; technological upgrading of existing plants, and enter in new market niches to increase the added value of steel production. This led to work in five different fronts (steel, mining, logistics, cement and energy) and to internationalize, which helped to make it one of the largest and most influential holdings of Brazil. From the viewpoint of the networks of production, in the process of CSŃs evolution a series of formal/informal networks was built, destroyed and rebuilt. It's possible to state that there was a change in the strategic profile of the CSN. First, the company migrated from a state-centered organization to a spoke and hub company after the privatization process. Regarding University-Industry-Government linkages the typical relationship in the phase ""company town"" (1945-1990) can be classified as the configuration type 2 of the Triple Helix in which the Government, through a state-owned company, sets the target to companies, university and shapes society as a whole. In the post-privatization period the relationship becomes distant. Several confluence areas of the three helices spheres are disrupted and renegotiated. The local university loses its primacy in relationships and other institutions are sought. New university-industry bilateral relations are constituted. Currently, University-Industry-Government linkages are tenuous without getting to characterize a configuration type 1 (laissez-faire). In economic terms, the analysis of the CSŃs evolution helps to understand the dynamics of Brazilian capitalism, through its relationships with stakeholders' spheres of university-industry-government, and their effort to compete on the international arena. A state capitalism has predominated along the century XX in Brazil where the system of production of goods and services has built apart from the system of science, technology and innovation.","Brazil; CSN; Innovation Management; Privatization; Regional Development; Strategy","Commerce; Economics; Industrial management; Industrial relations; Innovation; International trade; Investments; Military operations; Patents and inventions; Privatization; Regional planning; Steelmaking; Brazil; Innovation management; International markets; Raw material production; Regional development; State-owned companies; Strategy; University industries; Industrial economics",,,,,,,,"Amaral, M., Ferreira, A., Teodoro, P., Building an entrepreneurial university in Brazil: The role and potential of university-industry linkages in promo ting regional economic development (2011) Industry & Higher Education, 25, pp. 383-395; Amaral, M., Schocair, M., Privatization, modernization and internationalization: How a steel Brazilian company turns a global raw materials player (2015) II WINIR Conference, Rio de Janeiro; Bazzo, K.C., Redes de cooperação das multinacionais brasileiras: um mapeamento a partir das patentes (2010) Dissertação de Mestrado, Faculdade de Economia, Admi Nistração e Contabilidade de Ribeirão Preto, USP, , Ribeirão Preto; Buso, M.A.M., Patentes como Instrumento de Proteção, Pesquisa e Competitividade (2011) Simpósio de Tecnologia, 1; Castro, E., Figueiredo, P.N., Aprendizagem tecnológica compensa?

Box 461, Gothenburg, CEP: SE 405 30, Sweden","Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate group in the world, with about 32% of species under some category of threat. Conservation strategies depend on basic data, such as species distribution and natural history, which are largely lacking for endemic species inhabiting mosaics of highland grasslands and forest patches of Southern and Southeastern Brazil. Highland grassland fields occur in the Serra do Mar ecoregion and harbor an endemic anuran fauna associated to rocky outcrops and open fields interspersed among Araucaria, Rain and Cloud Forests. Here, we assembled occurrence records of anurans from mosaics of highland grasslands and forest patches in Brazil from the literature. We also compiled the conservation status of those species, including the spatial distribution of richness and endemism. We found that 75 species occur in this environment, of which about 46% are endemic. Highland grassland areas in and around Protected Areas in the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira are under strong pressure, including criminal fire, forestry, and mining. Additionally, anurans from high altitude areas are apparently more prone to get infected by the chytrid fungus, whose growth is favored in cool and humid weather. Since anuran species inhabiting such seasonal environments have behavioral and life history adaptations, gathering data on how these disturbances affect anuran populations is urging in order to better inform conservation practices and landscape management plans. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Pre-concentration aims to remove barren material at as coarse a particle size and as early in the process as possible to reduce processing costs, energy consumption, water losses, and greenhouse gas emissions while increasing production and profitability. This may be achieved using bulk ore sorting—the separation of barren gangue from a fully loaded conveyor belt based on the grade as measured or inferred from a sensor. This paper evaluates the technical and economic viability of bulk ore sorting for the PanAust Phu Kham copper deposit in Lao PDR. Bulk ore sorting technology is described briefly along with discussion of appropriate sensor and diversion systems for the Phu Kham operation. To evaluate the economic implications, the actual mined material and costs from 2014 were used as the base-case. Sampling data was not available; therefore, the ore grade variability that would feed a bulk ore sorter was estimated using geo-statistical tools based on mine grade control data. The sorter performance when treating this material was simulated considering the accuracy of the sensor measurement and errors associated with material diversion. The impact on inferred cash flow was estimated for several different scenarios considering the additional costs for sorter operation and reject handling. The evaluation demonstrated that bulk ore sorting at Phu Kham has the potential to increase the amount of metal in product and/or reduce processing plant throughput (and costs) to improve the annual inferred cash flow for the conditions investigated. The sorter is the gatekeeper – only material above the cut-off grade (value-adding) reports to the processing plant; no waste dilutes the feed. Likewise, above cutoff grade material is not lost to waste; preventing lost revenue. © 2016 TAPPI Press.
