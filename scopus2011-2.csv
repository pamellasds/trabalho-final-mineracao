DMPML supports the reuse of data preprocessing directives using XSLT to map raw data into data ready to be used by many data mining algorithms. The application presented here, DMPML-TS, automates the data preparation phase, speeding up the codification and transformation of data, and providing support to facilitate the use of different data mining algorithms in the same and/or similar data, based on their codification stored in separate XML documents. This paper also presents improvements made to DMPML like the adoption of XRFF for input and output data and the use of only one XSLT file for data transformation.

We noticed the absence of a chart or pathway describing the well-studied preimplantation development stages; furthermore, not all genes involved in the process have entries in KEGG Orthology, important information for knowledge application with relation to other organisms.Results: In this work we sought to develop the regulatory pathway for the preimplantation development stage using text-mining tools such as Medline Ranker and PESCADOR to reveal biointeractions among the genes involved in this process. The genes present in the resulting pathway were also used as seeds for software developed by our group called SeedServer to create clusters of homologous genes. These homologues allowed the determination of the last common ancestor for each gene and revealed that the preimplantation development pathway consists of a conserved ancient core of genes with the addition of modern elements.Conclusions: The generation of regulatory pathways through text-mining tools allows the integration of data generated by several studies for a more complete visualization of complex biological processes. Using the genes in this pathway as "" seeds"" for the generation of clusters of homologues, the pathway can be visualized for other organisms. The clustering of homologous genes together with determination of the ancestry leads to a better understanding of the evolution of such process. © 2011 Donnard et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; computer program; controlled study; data mining; developmental stage; embryo development; gene cluster; gene interaction; last common ancestor; molecular evolution; nonhuman; orthology; preimplantation development; animal; cluster analysis; computer program; embryo development; factual database; gene regulatory network; human; information retrieval; mouse; stem cell transplantation; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Embryonic Development; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Mice; Software; Stem Cell Transplantation","Ortega, J.M.; Laboratório Biodados, Dept. de Bioquímica e Imunologia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 31270-901, Belo Horizonte - MG, Brazil; email: miguel@ufmg.br",,,14712164,,BGMEE,"22369103","English","BMC Genomics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84255188927

In this paper, we present a graph-based classification method, consisting of the construction of a special graph referred to as K-associated graph, which is capable of representing similarity relationships among data cases and proportion of classes overlapping. The main properties of the K-associated graphs as well as the classification algorithm are described. Experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed technique captures topological structure of the training data and leads to good results on classification task particularly for noisy data. In comparison to other well-known classification techniques, the proposed approach shows the following interesting features: (1) A new measure, called purity, is introduced not only to characterize the degree of overlap among classes in the input data set, but also to construct the K-associated optimal graph for classification; (2) nonlinear classification with automatic local adaptation according to the input data. Contrasting to K-nearest neighbor classifier, which uses a fixed K, the proposed algorithm is able to automatically consider different values of K, in order to best fit the corresponding overlap of classes in different data subspaces, revealing both the local and global structure of input data. (3) The proposed classification algorithm is nonparametric, implicating high efficiency and no need for model selection in practical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This can give important insights for the design of hardware cores, especially considering the benefits of the merge of software kernels and their implementation as a single hardware core. However, software codes have characteristics that make inadequate the direct use of typical data mining tools, mainly related to their large number of samples and the imprecise definition of code features for mining. Those characteristics affect negatively the performance of the most known data mining methods. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper the use of three techniques: the Normalized Compression Distance, the Neighbor Joining, and the Fast Newman algorithm. We combine these three techniques and propose a new approach for data mining of code repositories (DAMICORE). DAMICORE works with different types of code representations. Experiments reveal DAMICORE can indicate important software similarities at source code level. Specifically, merging soft-ware kernels identified by DAMICORE results in FPGA cores with size smaller than the overall hardware size needed when implementing a core for each kernel. © 2011 IEEE.","Data Mining; Data-path Merging; Fast Newman; FPGA; Hardware Cores; Neighbor Joining; Normalized Compression Distance","Code representation; Data mining methods; Data paths; Data-mining tools; Direct use; Fast Newman; FPGA core; Hardware implementations; Neighbor joining; Normalized compression distance; Number of samples; Similar pattern; Software codes; Software similarities; Source codes; Codes (symbols); Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Joining; Reconfigurable architectures; Data mining","Sanches, A.; Universidade Do Porto, Faculdade de Engenharia, Departamento de Engenharia Informática, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias s/n, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal; email: aksanches@gmail.com",,,,9780769545516,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

First, homogeneous precipitation areas for the 1987-1996 and 1997-2006 decades were defined. Subsequently, by the overlapping of the clusters obtained from both periods, six common areas were defined ranging from A to F. The changes in the volume of precipitation were evaluated annual seasonal and monthly. The results indicated significant increases (20 to 240 mm) in annual precipitation in all areas, except in area A. In the seasonal analysis, the variations were random, and in the spring all areas showed significant increase (44 to 142 mm). In the monthly analysis, the results revealed a reduction occurred in January in all areas, except in area E. In the other months, the changes were random.

In this context, we present an approach using data mining techniques in order to identify intra and inter organizational linkages amongst groups of people with similar profiles. Using clustering techniques, we identify groups of people in a way that allows us to evaluate how researchers collaborate in the Brazilian scientific scenario of Computing Science. Besides this, we are able to understand how research flows amongst the best universities and research centres in Brazil.

In this context, this paper describes the parameters to be considered in the choice of these techniques in order to assist the analyst in the task of data exploration. These parameters are: data type, task type, data volume, dimensionality (number of attributes) and positioning of the attributes in the graph. The method used to identify the parameters is based on the Grounded Theory methodology.

A variation of the traditional univariate approach is the so-called oblique decision tree, which allows multivariate tests in its non-terminal nodes. Oblique decision trees can model decision boundaries that are oblique to the attribute axes, whereas univariate trees can only perform axis-parallel splits. The majority of the oblique and univariate decision tree induction algorithms perform a top-down strategy for growing the tree, relying on an impurity-based measure for splitting nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up algorithm for inducing oblique trees named BUTIA. It does not require an impurity-measure for dividing nodes, since we know a priori the data resulting from each split. For generating the splitting hyperplanes, our algorithm implements a support vector machine solution, and a clustering algorithm is used for generating the initial leaves. We compare BUTIA to traditional univariate and oblique decision tree algorithms, C4.5, CART, OC1 and FT, as well as to a standard SVM implementation, using real gene expression benchmark data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several cases. © 2011 IEEE.","bottom-up induction; clustering; hybrid intelligent systems; oblique decision trees; SVM","bottom-up induction; clustering; Hybrid intelligent system; Oblique decision tree; SVM; Clustering algorithms; Decision trees; Gene expression; Intelligent systems; Support vector machines; Systems analysis; Trees (mathematics); Data mining","Barros, R.C.; Department of Computer Science, ICMC, University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos - SP, Brazil; email: rcbarros@icmc.usp.br",,,21647143,9781457716751,,,"English","Int.

Rational drug design is one of the current scientific areas that has greatly benefited from bioinformatics, particularly a step, which analyzes receptor-ligand interactions via molecular docking simulations. An important challenge is the inclusion of the receptor flexibility since they can become computationally very demanding. We have represented this explicit flexibility as a series of different conformations derived from a molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of the receptor. This model has been termed as the fully flexible receptor (FFR) model. In our studies, the receptor is the enzyme InhA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is the major drug target for the treatment of tuberculosis. The FFR model of InhA (named FFR InhA) was docked to four ligands, namely, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, pentacyano(isoniazid)ferrate II, triclosan, and ethionamide, thus, generating very large amounts of data, which needs to be mined to produce useful knowledge to help accelerate drug discovery and development. Very little work has been done in this area. In this article, we review our work on the application of classification decision trees, regression model tree, and association rules using properly preprocessed data of the FFR molecular docking results, and show how they can provide an improved understanding of the FFR InhA-ligand behavior. Furthermore, we explain how data mining techniques can support the acceleration of molecular docking simulations of FFR models. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,"Classification decision; Data mining techniques; Drug Design; Drug discovery; Drug targets; Integral part; Knowledge discovery in database; Large amounts of data; Molecular docking; Molecular docking simulations; Molecular dynamics simulations; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides; Pre-processed data; Receptor flexibility; Receptor-ligand interactions; Regression model; Triclosan; Amides; Bioinformatics; Decision trees; Forestry; Ligands; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Regression analysis; Trees (mathematics); Tubes (components); Computer simulation; Amides; Ligands; Mathematics; Regression Analysis; Simulation; Trees","Machado, K.S.; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande, Centro de Ciências Computacionais-C3, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; email: karina.machado@pucrs.br",,,19424787,,,,"English","Wiley Interdiscip.

Methods: The construction of the prototype was separated into five steps: analysis of an existing system (legacy), the analysis of requirements and specifications for the new prototype, the development of the model, definition of technologies and the development of a prototype. Results: The analysis of the legacy system revealed several limitations and inconsistencies, which can result in problems concerning the DQ. Therefore, actions to prevent these problems are already being executed at the step of developing the prototype, such as the creation of interactive and more elaborate interfaces, the use of validation mechanisms on data fields and the proposal of a process to monitor inconsistencies and incompleteness in patients' data. Conclusion: The adoption of DQ mechanisms on system development results in building a reliable and consistent database, to assist tasks such as management, scientific research and future intelligent data analysis methods. Future work includes subjective evaluations of DQ indicating the adequacy of the prototype for the users' needs.","Colorectal surgery; Data analysis; Data collection; Data mining; Information systems",,"Lee, H.

The execution of such processes is usually monitored to register important information about the dynamic behavior of the software development process. As a result, a huge amount of information is stored in the database and the software managers are deluged by data. Then, it is important to find ways to automatically analyze the process execution logs to discover the actual process model, characterize trends in it, and flag anomalies. Process mining is a well established technique designed to attack this challenge. 'This paper demonstrates the application of process mining technique and tools to perform a software development process conformance analysis to detect inconsistencies between a process model and its corresponding execution log. The work conducts a case study using an event log database with more than 2,000 process instances gently provided by a Brazilian software house.

What are the mechanisms that explain how human actions are distributed over time? Here we answer these questions by studying the time interval between calls and SMS messages in an anonymized, large mobile network, with 3.1 million users, over 200 million phone calls and 300 million SMS messages, spanning 70 GigaBytes. Our first contribution is the Truncated Autocatalytic Process (TAP) model, that explains the time between communication events (ie., times between phone-initiations) for a single individual. The novelty is that the model is 'autocatalytic', in the sense that the parameters of the model change, depending on the latest inter-event time: long periods of inactivity in the past result in long periods of inactivity in the future, and vice-versa. We show that the TAP model mimics the inter-event times of the users of our dataset extremely well, despite its parsimony and simplicity. Our second contribution is the TAP-classifier, a classification method based on the interevent times and in addition to other features. We showed that the inferred sleep intervals and the reciprocity between outgoing and incoming calls are good features to classify users. Finally, analyze the network effects of each class of users and we found surprising results. Moreover, all of our methods are fast, and scale linearly with the number of customers.

Currently, the information gathered from this platform is typically used to evaluate, analyze and document the scientific productions of Brazilian research groups. Despite the fact that the Lattes curricula has semi-structured information, the analysis procedure for medium and large groups becomes a time consuming and highly error-prone task. In this paper, we describe an extension of the scriptLattes (an open-source knowledge extraction system from the Lattes platform), for analysing individuals Lattes curricula and automatically discover large-scale co-authorship networks for any academic area. Given some knowledge domain (academic area), the system automatically allows to identify researchers associated with the academic area, extract every list of scientific productions of the researchers, discretized by type and publication year, and for each paper, identify the co-authors registered in the Lattes Platform. The system also allows the generation of different types of networks which may be used to study the characteristics of academic areas at large scale. In particular, we explored the node's degree and Author Rank measures for each identified researcher. Finally, we confirm through experiments that the system facilitates a simple way to generate different co-authorship networks.

However, a higher citation index does not necessarily mean that a publication necessarily had a positive feedback from citing authors, as a citation can represent a negative criticism. In order to overcome this limitation, we used sentiment analysis to rate citations as positive, neutral or negative. Adjectives are initially extracted from the citations, with the SentiWordNet lexicon being used to rate the degree of positivity and negativity for each adjective. Relevance scores were then computed to rank citations according to the sentiment expressed in the text corresponding to each citation. As expected for accurate information retrieval systems, higher precision rates were observed in the initial points of the curve. The SRC (0.6728) computed using number of raw citations is lower than the SRC (0.7397) observed by the ranking generated using sentiment scores (Table 3). Conclusion: This result indicates that child articles with higher values of relevance score were in general the ones expressing positive opinion about their parents. Therefore, the ranking generated by sentiment scores had an improved accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","Impact factor; Sentiment analysis; SentiWordNet; Spearman ranking correlation","Citation index; Impact factor; Initial point; Precision rates; Ranking correlation; Relevance score; Sentiment analysis; SentiWordNet; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Feedback; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Publishing; Search engines","Cavalcanti, D.C.; Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, UFPE, Recife, Brazil; email: dcc2@cin.ufpe.br",,,10823409,9780769545967,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

Building such systems involves several practically important problems, from data cleansing (e.g., boilerplate removal, web-spam detection), and sentiment analysis at individual mention-level (e.g., phrase, sentence-, document-level) to the aggregation of sentiment for each entity-level (e.g., person, company) analysis. Most previous research in sentiment analysis however, has focused only on individual mention-level analysis, and there has been relatively less work that copes with other practically important problems for enabling a large-scale sentiment monitoring system. In this paper, we propose Empath, a new framework for evaluating entity-level sentiment analysis. Empath leverages objective measurements of entities in various domains such as people, companies, countries, movies, and sports, to facilitate entity-level sentiment analysis and tracking. We demonstrate the utility of Empath for the evaluation of a large-scale sentiment system by applying it to various lexicons using Lydia, our own large scale text-analytics tool, over a corpus consisting of more than a terabyte of newspaper data. We expect that Empath will encourage research that encompasses end-to-end pipelines to enable a large-scale text-driven monitoring and forecasting systems. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Data cleansing; Entity-level; Forecasting system; Fundamental component; Monitoring system; Objective measurement; Real-world entities; Sentiment analysis; Data mining; Embedded systems; Exhibitions; Industry; Monitoring","Ward, C.B.; Computer Science Dept., Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States; email: charles@cs.sunysb.edu",,,,9781457715914,,,"English","Int.

The most relevant contributions include the use of summarized texts as an entrance in pre-processing stage of clusterization, language independence with the use of stop words and the treatment of high dimensionality, a problem that is inherent to Text Mining. In the knowledge extraction, the texts are clustered and reclustered according to a similarity criterion. With the results obtained, the study hopes to show the impact of including summarization in the process of text clusterization. The experiments conducted in this study indicate that text clusterization using summaries is in fact much more effective than direct clusterization of texts in their entirety, as measured by internal and external measures traditionally employed in the field of text clusterization. Finally, the post-processing stage creates clusters of summarized texts with a high degree of informativity, a quality that is inherent to summarization. The clusters are highly esteemed with the indexed words. This fact is due to the process proposed by the Cassiopeia model, which allows for strong similarity among the clustered texts. In the future, this similarity will allow for the creation of categories based on the word indices of each cluster. © 2011 ICITST.","External and Internal Clustering Measures; Knowledge Discovery; Similarity; Summarization; Text Mining","Clusterization; External and Internal Clustering Measures; High dimensionality; Knowledge extraction; Language independence; Post-processing stages; Pre-processing; Similarity; Similarity criteria; Stop word; Summarization; Text mining; Data mining; Internet; Natural language processing systems","Guelpeli, M.V.C.; Departamento de Ciência Da Computação, Universidade Federal Fluminense - UFF, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: mguelpeli@ic.uff.br",,,,9781908320001,,,"English","Int.

Initially, a system for extracting features of the hydro-generator operational database has been developed to detect possible problems that cause premature fails. The system has been divided in two parts. The first one is a data acquisition system directly connected to the generator in order to sample some operational variables. The second part concerns an intelligent data mining, into the database involving the supervision system variables, to use the existing historic data to perform analysis of the problems and possible causes.","Data mining; Electrical measurements; Hydro-generators; Intelligent systems; Maintenance","Data acquisition system; Degradation condition; Electrical measurement; Extracting features; Historic data; Hydro generator; Hydro-generators; Intelligent data; Operational database; Operational variables; Predictive maintenance; Supervision systems; Data mining; Intelligent systems; Maintenance; Navigation; Innovation","Ribeiro, L.C.; Itapebi - Neoenergia Power Plant Co., Av.

They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification. © 2011 IEEE.","Image Classification; Multidimensional Projections; Similarity Trees","Computational costs; Data objects; Data organization; Data sets; Drill-down; Hierarchical data organization; High precision; Multi-dimensional space; Multidimensional Projections; Neighbor joining; Similarity Trees; Virtual node; Visual analysis; Visual classification; Visual data; Visual data mining; Visual space; Image analysis; Image classification; Joining; Plant extracts; Trees (mathematics); Classification (of information)","Paiva, J.G.S.; Federal University of Uberlândia, ICMCBrazil; email: jgustavo@icmc.usp.br",,,10772626,,ITVGE,,"English","IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graphics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80955157799

Such quality relies on the model's completeness and validity in relation to the concepts it is supposed to represent. Since the modeler acquires such concepts mostly from texts created in a natural language, a semantic-oriented linguistic approach should be adopted for building unambiguous conceptualizations. Also, the chosen modeling language must offer enough constructs for the creation of a faithful representation, like OntoUML. Such languages, however, may require a learning period that modelers hardly can afford. This paper proposes a modeling method that consists of systematic steps to promote the understanding of the concepts inherent to the domain to be modeled. The method application is illustrated in an example. Additional evaluations of the proposed method included a case study, which results indicated that it makes modeling less complex by allowing for modeling choices to be dealt with within the realm of the natural language. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Conceptual modeling; linguistics; OntoUML; semantics","Conceptual data modeling; Conceptual data models; Conceptual modeling; Linguistic approach; Modeling languages; Modeling method; Natural languages; OntoUML; Data mining; Linguistics; Semantics","Castro, L.; NP2Tec, Research and Practice Group in Information Technology, Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: lucia.castro@uniriotec.br",,,03029743,9783642246050,,,"English","Lect.

Abstracts from the biomedical literature stored in the NCBI's PubMed database can be used for the derivation of interactions between genes and proteins by identifying the co-occurrences of their terms. Often, the amount of interactions obtained through such an approach is large and may mix processes occurring in different contexts. Current tools do not allow studying these data with a focus on concepts of relevance to a user, for example, interactions related to a disease or to a biological mechanism such as protein aggregation.Results: To help the concept-oriented exploration of such data we developed PESCADOR, a web tool that extracts a network of interactions from a set of PubMed abstracts given by a user, and allows filtering the interaction network according to user-defined concepts. We illustrate its use in exploring protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease and in the expansion of pathways associated to colon cancer.Conclusions: PESCADOR is a platform independent web resource available at: http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/pescador/. © 2011 Barbosa-Silva et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Amount of interaction; Biological functions; Biological mechanisms; Biomedical literature; Interaction networks; Platform independent; Protein aggregation; Web-based tools; Abstracting; Active networks; Genes; Tools; Proteins; protein; article; colorectal tumor; computer program; data mining; degenerative disease; genetics; human; Internet; Medline; metabolism; Colorectal Neoplasms; Data Mining; Humans; Internet; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Proteins; PubMed; Software","Barbosa-Silva, A.; Computational Biology and Data Mining Group, Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rössle-Strasse. 10, D-13125, Berlin, Germany; email: adriano.barbosa@mdc-berlin.de",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"22070195","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-82455162310

As a consequence, information used by a wide range of systems has been stored in multi relational tables. However, from a data mining point of view, it has been a problem, since most of the traditional data mining algorithms have not been originally proposed to handle this type of data without discarding relationship information. Aiming to ameliorate this problem, we propose a hierarchical approach for handling relational data. In this approach the relational data is converted into a hierarchical structure (the main table as the root and the relations as the nodes). This hierarchical way to represent relational data can be used either for classification or clustering purposes. In this paper, we will use it in clustering algorithms. In order to do so, we propose a hierarchical distance metric to compute the similarity between the tables. In the empirical analysis, we will apply the proposed approach in two well-known clustering algorithms (k-means and agglomerative hierarchical). Finally, this paper also compares the effectiveness of our approach with one existing relational approach. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Agglomerative hierarchical; Data mining algorithm; Distance metrics; Empirical analysis; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical structures; K-means; Relational data; Relational Model; Relational tables; Word problem; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Neural networks; Clustering algorithms","Xavier, J.C.; Computing and Automation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande Do Norte (UFRN), Natal, RN 59078-900, Brazil; email: jcxavier01@gmail.com",,,,9781457710865,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054770818

We reevaluated data produced by the guarana (Paullinia cupana) transcriptome sequencing project to identify cDNA clones with complete coding sequences (full-length clones) and complete sequences of genes of biotechnological interest, contributing to the knowledge of biological characteristics of this organism. We analyzed 15,490 ESTs of guarana in search of clones with complete coding regions. A total of 12,402 sequences were analyzed using BLAST, and 4697 full-length clones were identified, responsible for the production of 2297 different proteins. Eighty-four clones were identified as full-length for N-methyltransferase and 18 were sequenced in both directions to obtain the complete genome sequence, and confirm the search made in silico for full-length clones. Phylogenetic analyses were made with the complete genome sequences of three clones, which showed only 0.017% dissimilarity; these are phylogenetically close to the caffeine synthase of Theobroma cacao. The search for full-length clones allowed the identification of numerous clones that had the complete coding region, demonstrating this to be an efficient and useful tool in the process of biological data mining.

As predictive performance evaluation is a multidimensional problem, single scalar summaries such as error rate, although quite convenient due to its simplicity, can seldom evaluate all the aspects that a complete and reliable evaluation must consider. Due to this, various graphical performance evaluation methods are increasingly drawing the attention of machine learning, data mining, and pattern recognition communities. The main advantage of these types of methods resides in their ability to depict the trade-offs between evaluation aspects in a multidimensional space rather than reducing these aspects to an arbitrarily chosen (and often biased) single scalar measure. Furthermore, to appropriately select a suitable graphical method for a given task, it is crucial to identify its strengths and weaknesses. This paper surveys various graphical methods often used for predictive performance evaluation. By presenting these methods in the same framework, we hope this paper may shed some light on deciding which methods are more suitable to use in different situations. © 2011 IEEE.","cost curves; data mining; lift graphs; Machine learning; performance evaluation; ROC curves","Classification system; Cost curves; Error rate; Graphical methods; Machine-learning; Multi-dimensional space; Multidimensional problems; Performance evaluation; Predictive performance; ROC curves; Data mining; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Surveys; Graphic methods","Prati, R.C.; Centro de Matemática, Computação e Cogniçã o, Universidade Federal Do ABC, Rua Santa Adélia, 166 Bairro Bangu, CEP 09.210-170, Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil; email: ronaldo.prati@ufabc.edu.br",,,10414347,,ITKEE,,"English","IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053222008

According to both techniques (PCA and clustering), clusters for different set of variables are distinct only when cultivated land was included in the dataset. On the contrary, climate variables determine the clustering formation. Exploring multitemporal images from high resolution satellites through data mining techniques, such as cluster analysis, is a valuable way to improve crops monitoring specially at a time when it becomes increasingly important to understand the impact of climate change on agriculture. © 2011 IEEE.","Clustering; low spatial resolution; NDVI; PCA; time series","Agricultural monitoring; Climate condition; Climate variables; Clustering; Cultivated lands; Data mining techniques; Data sets; High resolution satellites; Low resolution; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; NDVI; NOAA/AVHRR; PCA; Regional scale; Spatial resolution; Sugarcane yield; Climate change; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Image reconstruction; Land use; Remote sensing; Time series; Time series analysis; Principal component analysis","Gonçalves, R.R.V.; CNPq, Cepagri, University of Campinas, 13083-970, Campinas, Brazil",,,,9781457712036,,,"English","Int.

A profusion of systems and algorithms devoted to this end has been constructed under the conceptual framework of granular computing. This paper outlines a fuzzy set based granular evolving modeling FBeM approach for learning from imprecise data. Granulation arises because modeling uncertain data dispenses attention to details. The evolving aspect is fundamental to account endless flows of nonstationary data and structural adaptation of models.

Factors like size and high dimensionality of databases adds difficulties to the complex task of discovering patterns hidden in masses of data. The feasibility of highdimensional data exploration depends on techniques known as dimensionality reduction methods. When class labels are available, an optimization function can be used to maximize intra class cohesion and inter class separation. However, in many practical situations information about class is not available. This paper focuses on unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, an important phase in exploratory data analysis. Six important methods are described: Principal components analysis, Sammon projection, Auto-associative Neural network, Kohonen maps, Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding. Three quality indexes are proposed to try to quantify to some degree the topology preservation between input and output spaces. Comparisons are performed using benchmark data sets.

The P-means execution was divided into 6 well-defined steps, where each step was analyzed to create a hierarchical task structure in order to parallelize the execution enabling it to explore the hierarchy and heterogeneity of the Cell BE blades and others heterogeneous architectures. The algorithm implementation was also adapted to perform sequential timing measures to evaluate the Amdahl's law, to compare the theoretical calculation and the execution times' measurements and to introduce parallel computation by using the StarSs framework. The algorithm was executed using a 30 clusters dataset containing 600 thousand points of 60 dimensions in different hardware configurations in order to compare its execution time and speedup, and it showed a overall speedup of more than 18 times.

In such an environment, the ability to automatically analyze user opinions and sentiments as discussions develop is a powerful resource known as real time sentiment analysis. However, this task comes with several challenges, including the need to deal with highly dynamic textual content that is characterized by changes in vocabulary and its subjective meaning and the lack of labeled data needed to support supervised classifiers. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning strategy to perform real time sentiment analysis. We identify a task - opinion holder bias prediction - which is strongly related to the sentiment analysis task; however, in constrast to sentiment analysis, it builds accurate models since the underlying relational data follows a stationary distribution. Instead of learning textual models to predict content polarity (i.e., the traditional sentiment analysis approach), we first measure the bias of social media users toward a topic, by solving a relational learning task over a network of users connected by endorsements (e.g., retweets in Twitter). We then analyze sentiments by transferring user biases to textual features. This approach works because while new terms may arise and old terms may change their meaning, user bias tends to be more consistent over time as a basic property of human behavior. Thus, we adopted user bias as the basis for building accurate classification models. We applied our model to posts collected from Twitter on two topics: the 2010 Brazilian Presidential Elections and the 2010 season of Brazilian Soccer League. Our results show that knowing the bias of only 10% of users generates an F1 accuracy level ranging from 80% to 90% in predicting user sentiment in tweets.

The main questions are (a) how to minimize the I/O cost, taking into account the already existing data partition (e.g., on disks), and (b) how to minimize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of them may be a bottleneck. Thus, we propose the Best of both Worlds - BoW method, that automatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good strategy. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose BoW and carefully derive its cost functions, which dynamically choose the best strategy; (2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable features: it can work with most serial clustering methods as a pluggedin clustering subroutine, it balances the cost for disk accesses and network accesses, achieving a very good tradeoff between the two, it uses no user-defined parameters (thanks to our reasonable defaults), it matches the clustering quality of the serial algorithm, and it has near-linear scale-up; and finally, (3) We report experiments on real and synthetic data with billions of points, using up to 1, 024 cores in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, our Yahoo! web is the largest real dataset ever reported in the database subspace clustering literature. Spanning 0.2 TB of multi-dimensional data, it took only 8 minutes to be clustered, using 128 cores.

The data set consisted of 1) 22 B-horizon soil variables: P, C, pH, Al, total acidity, Ca, Mg, K, total cation exchange capacity, sum of exchangeable bases, base saturation, Cu, Zn, Fe, B, S, Mn, gammaspectrometry (total count, potassium, thorium, and uranium) and magnetic susceptibility measures; and 2) six topographic variables: elevation, slope, aspect, hydrological accumulated flux, horizontal curvature and vertical curvature. It is characterized at 304 locations from a quasi-regular grid spaced about 24km across the state of Paraná. This data base was split into two subsets: one for analysis and modeling (274 samples) and the other for validation (30 samples) purposes. The self-organizing map and clustering methods were used to identify and classify the relations among solid-phase chemical element concentrations and GIS derived topographic models. The correlation between elevation and k-means clusters related the relative position inside hydrologic macro basins, which was interpreted as an expression of the weathering process reaching a steady-state condition at the regional scale. Locally, the chemical element concentrations were related to the vertical curvature representing concave-convex hillslope features, where concave hillslopes with convergent flux tends to be a reducing environment and convex hillslopes with divergent flux, oxidizing environments. Stochastic cross validation demonstrated that the SOM produced unbiased classifications and quantified the relative amount of uncertainty in predictions. This work strengthens the hypothesis that, at B-horizon steady-state conditions, the terrain morphometry were linked with the soil geochemical weathering in a two-way dependent process: the topographic relief was a factor on environmental geochemistry while chemical weathering was for terrain feature delineation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Geomorphometry; Hillslope chemical weathering; Self-organizing map; Uncertainty","chemical weathering; data mining; GIS; hillslope; morphometry; steady-state equilibrium; uncertainty analysis; Brazil; Parana","Iwashita, F.; Geosciences Institute, Campinas UniversityBrazil; email: fabio_iwashita@hotmail.com",,,0169555X,,,,"English","Geomorphology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960253630

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive capability of the game to detect ADHD cases through the analysis of its data by data mining techniques. METHOD: Eighty children, classified by teachers according to the DSM-IV symptoms, participated in a playing session with the Supermarket Game. The game captured a features set from each player: Gender, age, points (from eighteen stages) and time (from eighteen stages). Two data mining algorithms were used to classify the data produced by the game according to the disorder: naive Bayes and decision tree. Four hypotheses about the best data configuration were proposed: Numerical attributes with four classes, categorical attributes with four classes, categorical attributes with two classes and attribute selection. The performance metrics used to evaluate the prediction models were sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The data analysis with numerical attributes doesn't produce good results. With categorical attributes, an improvement in the decision tree performance was observed. With two classes (i.e. without considering ADHD subtypes) both algorithms achieve good results. The best results were obtained by the attribute selection technique, although this approach should be considered with caution. CONCLUSION: The Supermarket Game seems to be sensitive in the task of identifying children classified as ADHD positive by the teacher, although its capability to classify the disorder subtypes is weak. In future works, other samples of individuals (including from other age groups), and other data mining algorithms should be considered in order to validate this approach. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Age groups; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Attribute selection; Categorical attributes; Computer game; Data configuration; Data mining algorithm; Data mining techniques; ITS data; Naive Bayes; Numerical attributes; Performance metrics; Prediction model; Predictive capabilities; Sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Computer software; Data reduction; Decision trees; Human computer interaction; Mathematical models; Plant extracts; Rating; Retail stores; Social networking (online); Teaching; Trees (mathematics); Virtual reality; Data mining","Santos, F.E.G.; Programa de Pós-Gradução em Informática, Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro - UNIRIO, Av.

Each edge has assigned a different cost, to be paid for testing it. Testing an edge e reveals in which component of T - e lies the vertex to be identified. We give a complete characterization of the computational complexity of this problem with respect to both tree diameter and degree. In particular, we show that it is strongly NP-hard to compute a minimum cost decision tree for weighted trees of diameter at least 6, and for trees having degree three or more. For trees of diameter five or less, we give a polynomial time algorithm. Moreover, for the degree 2 case, we significantly improve the straightforward O(n3) dynamic programming approach, and provide an O(n2) time algorithm.

These stresses often lead to the accumulation of osmoprotectants in most organisms, including plants. In the present work, a search of known osmoprotectants (P5CS, P5CR, INPS1, BADH, CMO, TPS, TPP, OASTL and SAT) was carried out in the sugarcane transcriptome (237,954 expressed sequence tags) using in silico procedures. Alignments revealed that sugarcane presents a high number of osmoprotectant candidate genes, with 56 clusters found. In silico expression revealed higher expression in stressed callus tissues and those infected by Herbaspirilum rubrisubalbicans (HR), confirming the multi-function character of the osmoprotectants. As expected, the phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct groups among angiosperms, algae, animals, fungi and bacteria, in almost all dendrograms, with high degree of sequence conservation among angiosperms. As observed in comparative analysis between the ORFs of sugarcane and other organisms, the genic structure of these plants was relatively conserved suggesting that the accumulation of compatible solutes is an ancient metabolic adaptation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","crop evolution; data mining; differential expression; drought stress; salt stress","Callus tissue; Candidate genes; Comparative analysis; Compatible solutes; Crop productivity; Dendrograms; Differential expressions; drought stress; Environmental stress; Expressed sequence tags; In-silico; Metabolic adaptation; Multi-functions; Osmoprotectants; Phylogenetic analysis; Saccharum spp; salt stress; Sequence conservation; Transcriptomes; Comparative analysis; Differential expression; Drought stress; Environmental stress; Expressed sequence tags; Phylogenetic analysis; Salt stresss; Sequence conservation; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Drought; Genes; Tissue; Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Crops; Data mining; Drought; Bioinformatics; Biology","Barros Dos Santos, P.; Department of Genetics, Center of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, R.

Nevertheless, the information they provide is still underused. Extracting information from the raw data generated by the sensors is a complicated task, and it is usually used to help the operator react to undesired events, other than preventing them. This paper presents SDAEM (Sensor Data Analysis for Equipment Monitoring), an oil process plant monitoring model that covers three main goals: mining the sensor time series data to understand plant operation status and predict failures, interpreting correlated data from different sensors to verify sensors interdependence, and adjusting equipments working set points that leads to a more stable plant operation and avoids an excessive number of alarms. In addition, as time series data generated by sensors grow at an extremely fast rate, SDAEM uses parallel processing to provide real-time feedback. We have applied our model to monitor a process plant of a Brazilian offshore platform. Initial results were promising since some undesired events were recognized and operators adopted the tool to assist them finding good set points for the oil processing equipments. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Data mining; Equipment monitoring; Time series analysis",,"Bentes, C.; Department of Systems Engineering and Computer Science, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rua São Francisco Xavier 524, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20550-900, Brazil; email: cris@eng.uerj.br",,,02191377,,,,"English","Knowl.

In this study, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a sparse p-peptide frequency matrix (M) is used to detect and extract signals from noisy protein data (M = USVT). The central matrix S is diagonal and contains the singular values of M in decreasing order. Here we give sense to the biological significance of the SVD: the singular value spectrum visualized as scree plots unreveals the main components, the process that exists hidden in the database. This information can be used in many applications as clustering, gene expression analysis, immune response pattern identification, characterization of protein molecular dynamics and phylogenetic inference. The visualization of singular value spectrum from SVD analysis shows how many processes can be hidden in database and can help biologists to detect and extract small signals from noisy data.","Data mining; Information retrieval; Linear algebra; SVD","Biological process; Biological significance; Computational biology; Frequency matrix; Gene expression analysis; Immune response; Main component; matrix; Noisy data; Phylogenetic inference; Protein data; Protein sequence data; Singular values; Small signal; Algorithms; Bioinformatics; Data visualization; Gene expression; Information retrieval; Linear algebra; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Proteins; Signal detection; Singular value decomposition; Visualization; Data mining","Couto, B.

ArchMine, an architecture recovery approach based on dynamic analysis and data mining, aims at assisting in program understanding and software reuse by detecting cohesive classes that implement a set of related functionalities, i.e., architectural elements. It is supported by a tool set integrated into a reuse-based software development environment. In order to better reach the proposed goals, ArchMine is integrated with two other approaches, namely: ArqCheck, an architectural evaluation approach based on inspection, and ArchToDSSA, a domain variability detection approach. ArchMine and its tool set have been detailed in previous works. The contribution of this paper is to describe how ArchMine and its tool set were evaluated and refined through a series of evaluation studies. These evaluations allowed us to gradually refine the approach based on the lessons learned.

These c-features are composed by terms that co-occur in documents without any restrictions on order or distance between terms within a document. This strategy precedes the classification task, in order to enhance documents with discriminative c-features. The idea is that, when c-features are used in conjunction with single-features, the ambiguity and noise inherent to their bag-of-words representation are reduced. We use c-features composed of two terms in order to make their usage computationally feasible while improving the classifier effectiveness. We test this approach with several classification algorithms and single-label multi-class text collections. Experimental results demonstrated gains in almost all evaluated scenarios, from the simplest algorithms such as kNN (13% gain in micro-average F1 in the 20 Newsgroups collection) to the most complex one, the state-of-the-art SVM (10% gain in macro-average F1 in the collection OHSUMED). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we propose a hybrid version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) metaheuristic, which incorporates a data mining process, to solve the p-median problem. We believe that patterns obtained by a data mining technique, from a set of suboptimal solutions of a combinatorial optimization problem, can be used to guide metaheuristic procedures in the search for better solutions. Traditional GRASP is an iterative metaheuristic which returns the best solution reached over all iterations. In the hybrid GRASP proposal, after executing a significant number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of suboptimal solutions for the p-median problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following GRASP iterations in the search through the combinatorial solution space. Computational experiments, comparing traditional GRASP and different data mining hybrid proposals for the p-median problem, showed that employing patterns mined from an elite set of suboptimal solutions made the hybrid GRASP find better results. Besides, the conducted experiments also evidenced that incorporating a data mining technique into a metaheuristic accelerated the process of finding near optimal and optimal solutions. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.","Combinatorial optimization; Data mining; GRASP; Hybrid metaheuristics; p-median problem","Combinatorial optimization problems; Computational experiment; Data mining process; Data mining techniques; Exact methods; GRASP; Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure; Hybrid metaheuristics; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Near-optimal solutions; Number of iterations; Optimal solutions; P-median problems; Solution space; Suboptimal solution; Combinatorial optimization; Experiments; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Mining; Optimal systems; Solution mining; Data mining","Plastino, A.; Department of Computer Science, Fluminense Federal University, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, 24210-240, Brazil; email: plastino@ic.uff.br",,,19321872,,,,"English","Stat.

Each file may be input for more than one task. Examples of Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications include Monte Carlo simulations, massive searches (such as key breaking), image manipulation applications and data mining algorithms. A common framework to execute BoT applications is the masterslave topology, in which the user machine is used to control the execution of tasks. In this scenario, a large number of concurrent tasks competing for resources (e.g., CPU and communication links) severely limits application execution scalability. This paper is devoted to study the scalability of BoT applications running on multi-node systems (such as clusters and multi-clusters) organized as hierarchical platforms, considering several communication paradigms. Our study employs a set of experiments that involves the simulation of various large-scale platforms. The results presented provide important guidelines for improving the scalability of practical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, this methodology can also be applied to identify linear and nonlinear loads. It should be emphasized that the entire database was obtained through laboratory essays, i.e., real data were acquired from residential loads. Thus, the residential system created in laboratory was fed by a configurable power source and in its output were placed the loads and the power quality analyzers (all measurements were stored in a microcomputer). So, the data were submitted to pre-processing, which was based on attribute selection techniques in order to minimize the complexity in identifying the loads. A newer database was generated maintaining only the attributes selected, thus, Artificial Neural Networks were trained to realized the identification of loads. In order to validate the methodology proposed, the loads were fed both under ideal conditions (without harmonics), but also by harmonic voltages within limits pre-established. These limits are in accordance with IEEE Std. 519-1992 and PRODIST (procedures to delivery energy employed by Brazilian's utilities).

Most high quality reviews serve as powerful tools in the evaluation of predefined tendencies, but they cannot actually uncover new trends within the literature. However, special statistical procedures to 'mine' the literature have been developed which aid in achieving such a goal. Objectives: This paper aims to uncover patterns within the literature on TMS as a whole, as well as specific trends in the recent literature on TMS for the treatment of depression. Methods: Data mining and text mining. Results: Currently there are 7299 publications, which can be clustered in four essential themes. Considering the frequency of the core psychiatric concepts within the indexed literature, the main results are: depression is present in 13.5% of the publications; Parkinson's disease in 2.94%; schizophrenia in 2.76%; bipolar disorder in 0.158%; and anxiety disorder in 0.142% of all the publications indexed in PubMed.

Objective: This paper aims to uncover patterns that are hidden under this huge mass of studies and then to review the most prominent sub-topics in 'BDNF and mental health'. Method: Several semi-automatic tools employed, in order to present: 1. A visual representation of BDNF's main molecular pathways; 2. A table with all the components of this pathway that are known to be associated with human diseases; 3. A conceptual map of the whole literature; 4. A histogram of the mental disorders that are known to be associated with BDNF, as well as a review of the literature on each one of these topics. Results: The conceptual map suggests that the field is divided in two major sections: BDNF molecular pathways, receptors, other neurotrophins and neurotransmitters; and BDNF-related disorders.

As queries can be very easily defined, an exploratory analysis of time course data is greatly facilitated. While timeboxes are effective, they have no provisions for dealing with noisy data or data with fluctuations along the time axis, which is very common in many applications. In particular, this is true for the analysis of gene expression time courses, which are mostly derived from noisy microarray measurements at few unevenly sampled time points. From a data mining point of view the robust handling of data through a sound statistical model is of great importance. Results: We propose probabilistic timeboxes, which correspond to a specific class of Hidden Markov Models, that constitutes an established method in data mining. Since HMMs are a particular class of probabilistic graphical models we call our method Probabilistic Graphical Query Language. Its implementation was realized in the free software package pGQL. We evaluate its effectiveness in exploratory analysis on a yeast sporulation data set. Conclusions: We introduce a new approach to define dynamic, statistical queries on time course data. It supports an interactive exploration of reasonably large amounts of data and enables users without expert knowledge to specify fairly complex statistical models with ease. The expressivity of our approach is by its statistical nature greater and more robust with respect to amplitude and frequency fluctuation than the prior, deterministic timeboxes. © 2011 Schilling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; computer graphics; computer program; data base; data mining; gene expression; gene expression time course; genetic model; hidden Markov model; priority journal; probabilistic graphical query language; probability; sporogenesis; yeast","Schilling, R.; Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Department of Computational Biology, Ihnestr. 63-73, 14195 Berlin, Germany; email: ruben.schilling@molgen.mpg.de",,,17560381,,,,"English","BioData Min.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955118980

Once captured, scientific data goes through a cleaning workflow before getting ready for analysis that will eventually confirm the scientist's hypothesis. The whole process is, nevertheless, complex and takes the focus of thescientist's attention away from his/her research and towards solving the complexity associated with managing computing products. Moreover, as the research evolves, references to previous results and workflows are needed as source of provenance data. Based on these observations, we claim that in-silico experiments must be supported by a hypotheses data model that describes the elements involved in a scientific exploration and supports hypotheses assessment.

Improvements in the whole transplantation process have been increasingly important in clinical practice. In this context are clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), which have reflected a significant amount of work to use mathematical and intelligent techniques. The aim of this article was to present consideration of intelligent techniques used in recent years (2009 and 2010) to analyze organ transplant databases. To this end, we performed a search of the PubMed and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge databases to find articles published in 2009 and 2010 about intelligent techniques applied to transplantation databases. Among 69 retrieved articles, we chose according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main techniques were: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Markov Models (MM), and Bayesian Networks (BN). Most articles used ANN. Some publications described comparisons between techniques or the use of various techniques together. The use of intelligent techniques to extract knowledge from databases of healthcare is increasingly common. Although authors preferred to use ANN, statistical techniques were equally effective for this enterprise. © 2011 by Elsevier Inc.

These data can be used in many application domains such as traffic management, urban planning, tourism, bird migration, and so on. Raw trajectory data, as generated by mobile devices have very little or no semantics, and in most applications a higher level of abstraction is needed to exploit these data for decision making. Although several different methods have been proposed so far for trajectory querying and mining, there are no software tools to help the end user with semantic trajectory data analysis. In this article we present a software architecture for semantic trajectory data mining as well as the first software prototype to enrich trajectory data with both semantic information and data mining.

Rather, contextualized cephalometrics can be more promising, since it allows integration among balanced cephalometric variables. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this manuscript is to present the application of a non-trivial mathematical model in cephalometrics, providing data mining by filtering certainty and contradiction in each network ""node"". METHODS: In the proposed ""neural network"", each ""cell"" is connected to others ""cells"" by ""synapses"". Such decision-making system is an artificial intelligence tool tailored to potentially increase the meaning of assessed data. RESULTS: The comparison between the final diagnose provided by the paraconsistent neural network with the opinions of three examiners was heterogeneous. Kappa agreement was fair for antero-posterior discrepancies, substantial or fair for vertical discrepancies and moderate for dental discrepancies. For the bimaxillary dental protrusion, the agreement was almost perfect. Similarly, the agreement among the three examiners, without any software aid, was just moderate for skeletal and dental discrepancies. An exception was dental protrusion, which agreement was almost perfect. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the analysis of performance of the developed technology supports that the presented electronic tool might match human decisions in the most of the events. As an expected limitation, such mathematical-computational tool was less effective for skeletal discrepancies than for dental discrepancies.","Artificial intelligence; Cephalometric diagnosis; Non-trivial logics",,"Del Santo, M.Rua Pedroso Alvarenga 162, Cj. 52, Itaim Bibi, CEP: 04.531-000 - São Paulo, SP, Brazil; email: marinho@delsanto.com.br",,,21769451,,,,"English; Portuguese","Den.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858168448

Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims at automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naïve Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class given the observed feature values of the documents, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. The semi-supervised learning classifier in the grid is available as a grid service, expanding the functionality of Aîuri Portal, which is a framework for a cooperative academic environment for education and research. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming by using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in learning and the classification process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","expectation-maximization; grid computing; naïve bayes; text classification","A-posteriori probabilities; Academic environment; Amount of information; Bayes Classifier; Character strings; Classification process; Distributed computations; Expectation Maximization; Grid environments; Grid infrastructures; Grid services; Heterogeneous resources; Inductive learning; Interesting information; Iterative algorithm; Labeled documents; Maximum a posteriori estimation; Maximum A posteriori probabilities; Mixture of multinomials; Pattern discovery; Pre-defined class; Probabilistic approaches; Semi-supervised learning; text classification; Text document; Text mining; Unlabeled data; Unlabeled documents; Blind source separation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Grid computing; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Maximum likelihood estimation; Maximum principle; Mining; Optimization; Probability; Supervised learning; Text processing; Data mining","Roncero, V.

In this work, we characterize the growth patterns of video popularity on the currently most popular video sharing application, namely YouTube. Using newly provided data by the application, we analyze how the popularity of individual videos evolves since the video's upload time. Moreover, addressing a key aspect that has been mostly overlooked by previous work, we characterize the types of the referrers that most often attracted users to each video, aiming at shedding some light into the mechanisms (e.g., searching or external linking) that often drive users towards a video, and thus contribute to popularity growth. Our analyses are performed separately for three video datasets, namely, videos that appear in the YouTube top lists, videos removed from the system due to copyright violation, and videos selected according to random queries submitted to YouTube's search engine. Our results show that popularity growth patterns depend on the video dataset. In particular, copyright protected videos tend to get most of their views much earlier in their lifetimes, often exhibiting a popularity growth characterized by a viral epidemic-like propagation process. In contrast, videos in the top lists tend to experience sudden significant bursts of popularity. We also show that not only search but also other YouTube internal mechanisms play important roles to attract users to videos in all three datasets.

However, it is sensitive to initialization of prototypes and requires that the number of clusters be specified in advance. This paper shows that evolutionary techniques conceived to guide the application of k-means can be more computationally efficient than systematic (i.e., repetitive) approaches that try to get around the above-mentioned drawbacks by repeatedly running the algorithm from different configurations for the number of clusters and initial positions of prototypes. To do so, a modified version of a (k-means based) fast evolutionary algorithm for clustering is employed.

Twenty municipalities and seven cropping seasons were selected between 1999 and 2006. The plant development cycle was divided into four phases, according to the sugarcane physiology, obtaining spectral and meteorological attributes for each phase. The most important attributes were selected and the average yield was classified according to a decision tree. Values obtained from the NDVI time profile from December to January next year enabled to classify yields into three classes: below average, average and above average. The results were more effective for 'average' and 'above average' classes, with 86.5 and 66.7% accuracy respectively.

Although progress in imaging technology has enabled the automation of cell counting for many different cell types, this process still has to be done manually in the case of images of embryonic stem cells. In this paper, we present a new automatic algorithm to detect and count embryonic stem cells in fluorescence microscopy images that identifies pluripotent stem cells cultured in vitro. Our approach uses luminance information to generate a graph-based image representation. The cell pattern is defined as a subgraph, and a graph-mining process is applied to detect the cells. The method is tolerant to variations in cell size and shape. Moreover, it can easily be parameterized to handle different image groups resulting from distinct differentiation protocols. The paper presents numerical results from tests made on a database with more than two hundred images, including EB cryosection, embryoid body cell migration, murine embryonic stem cell colonies under murine embryonic fibroblast, and neurosphere images. The results from our algorithm were validated by expert biologists, and provide good precision, recall and F-measure. Finally, a comparative study with the widely used watershed algorithm is presented. © 2011 - IOS Press and the author(s).

In the present work, we re-analyzed lower extremity running kinematic data of 17 young and 17 elderly male runners using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification approach. In total, 31 kinematic variables were extracted to train the classification algorithm and test the generalized performance. The results revealed different accuracy rates across three different kernel methods adopted in the classifier, with the linear kernel performing the best. A subsequent forward feature selection algorithm demonstrated that with only six features, the linear kernel SVM achieved 100% classification performance rate, showing that these features provided powerful combined information to distinguish age groups. The results of the present work demonstrate potential in applying this approach to improve knowledge about the age-related differences in running gait biomechanics and encourages the use of the SVM in other clinical contexts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Ageing; Kinematics; Running; SVM","Accuracy rate; Age groups; Age-related; Age-related changes; Ageing; Biomechanical gait; Classification algorithm; Classification approach; Classification performance; Combined informations; Data mining techniques; Feature selection algorithm; General approach; Inferential statistics; Kernel methods; Kinematic variables; Linear kernel; Lower extremity; Running; Running kinematics; SVM; Algorithms; Biomechanics; Data mining; Feature extraction; Gears; Kinematics; Support vector machines; accuracy; adult; aged; aging; ankle peak dorsiflexion angle; article; biomechanics; classification algorithm; controlled study; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee abduction angle; knee flexion excursion angle; male; musculoskeletal system parameters; peak knee abduction angle; priority journal; running; support vector machine; task performance; tibial rotation excursion; toe out angle; Adult; Aged; Aging; Artificial Intelligence; Biomechanics; Gait; Humans; Male; Running","Fukuchi, R.K.; Running Injury Clinic, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, Canada; email: r.fukuchi@ucalgary.ca",,,00219290,,JBMCB,"20980005","English","J.

Because of the continuous and rapid progress in the fields of genomics and proteomics, more data are available now than ever before. Coincidentally, data mining methods been developed and refined in order to handle this experimental windfall, thus allowing the scientific community to quantitatively address longstanding questions such as that of protein localization. Here, we develop a frequent pattern tree (FPT) approach to generate a minimum set of rules (mFPT) for predicting protein localization. We acquire a series of rules according to the features of yeast genomic data. The mFPT prediction accuracy is benchmarked against other commonly used methods such as Bayesian networks and logistic regression under various statistical measures. Our results show that mFPT gave better performance than other approaches in predicting protein localization. Meanwhile, setting 0.65 as the minimum hit-rate, we obtained 138 proteins that mFPT predicted differently than the simple naive bayesian method (SNB). In our analysis of these 138 proteins, we present novel predictions for the location for 17 proteins, which currently do not have any defined localization. These predictions can serve as putative annotations and should provide preliminary clues for experimentalists. We also compared our predictions against the eukaryotic subcellular localization database and related predictions by others on protein localization. Our method is quite generalized and can thus be applied to discover the underlying rules for protein-protein interactions, genomic interactions, and structure-function relationships, as well as those of other fields of research. © 2011 Wang et al.",,"fungal protein; fungal protein; accuracy; analytic method; article; Bayes theorem; cellular distribution; controlled study; frequent pattern tree; fungal genome; logistic regression analysis; nonhuman; prediction; protein analysis; protein localization; yeast; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biological model; biology; data mining; genetics; methodology; protein database; Eukaryota; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Protein; Fungal Proteins; Genome, Fungal; Models, Genetic","Wang, J.; State Key Laboratory of Electroanalytical Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China; email: jin.wang.1@stonybrook.edu",,,19326203,,,"21283516","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251632184

In this paper, data mining techniques are applied to provide a sound estimation for the time required to accomplish a maintenance task. Based on real-world data regarding maintenance requests, some regression models are built to predict the time required for each maintenance. Data on the team skill and the maintenance characteristics are mapped into values that predict better time estimations in comparison to the one predicted by the human expert. A particular finding from this research is that the time prediction provided by a human expert works as an inductive bias that improves the overall prediction accuracy of the models.

In attribute selection it is desirable to reduce the list of those to be presented to panelists to avoid fatigue, minimize costs and save time. In some applications the goal is to keep attributes that are relevant and non-redundant in the sensory characterization of products. In this paper, however, we are interested in keeping attributes that best discriminate between products. For that we present a data mining-based method for attribute selection in descriptive sensory panels, such as those used in the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis. The proposed method is implemented using Principal Component Analysis and the k-Nearest Neighbor classification technique, in conjunction with Pareto Optimal analysis. Objectives are (i) to identity the set of attributes that best discriminate samples analyzed in the panel, and (ii) to indicate the group of panelists that provide consistent evaluations.

While there is a plethora of classification algorithms that can be applied to time series, all of the current empirical evidence suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult to beat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm depends on the invariances required by the domain. For example, motion capture data typically requires invariance to warping. In this work we make a surprising claim. There is an invariance that the community has missed, complexity invariance. Intuitively, the problem is that in many domains the different classes may have different complexities, and pairs of complex objects, even those which subjectively may seem very similar to the human eye, tend to be further apart under current distance measures than pairs of simple objects. This fact introduces errors in nearest neighbor classification, where complex objects are incorrectly assigned to a simpler class. We introduce the first complexity-invariant distance measure for time series, and show that it generally produces significant improvements in classification accuracy. We further show that this improvement does not compromise efficiency, since we can lower bound the measure and use a modification of triangular inequality, thus making use of most existing indexing and data mining algorithms. We evaluate our ideas with the largest and most comprehensive set of time series classification experiments ever attempted, and show that complexity-invariant distance measures can produce improvements in accuracy in the vast majority of cases.

In this paper we analyze how Dengue epidemic is reflected on Twitter and to what extent that information can be used for the sake of surveillance. Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is a leading cause of illness and death in tropical and subtropical regions, including Brazil. We propose an active surveillance methodology that is based on four dimensions: volume, location, time and public perception. First we explore the public perception dimension by performing sentiment analysis. This analysis enables us to filter out content that is not relevant for the sake of Dengue surveillance. Then, we verify the high correlation between the number of cases reported by official statistics and the number of tweets posted during the same time period (i.e., R2 = 0:9578). A clustering approach was used in order to exploit the spatiotemporal dimension, and the quality of the clusters obtained becomes evident when they are compared to official data (i.e., RandIndex = 0:8914). As an application, we propose a Dengue surveillance system that shows the evolution of the dengue situation reported in tweets, which is implemented in www.observatorio.inweb. org.br/dengue/.

Our results show that the LAC algorithm has a good performance in fraud detection, where it was possible to cover 100% of the chargebacks with just 5% of the dataset. This result is promising since it was obtained from a dataset that presents a skewed distribution of the fraud classes. Moreover, we perform an economic efficiency analysis of the results in order to understand the real scenario from the company point of view.","Data mining; E-commerce; Fraud detection; Web application","Data mining; Electronic commerce; Associative classification; Economic efficiency; Electronic payment; Electronic transaction; Fraud detection; Skewed distribution; WEB application; Crime",,"Rodrigues L.White B.Isaias P.Santoro F.M.","IADIS",,9789898533012,,,"English","Proc.

A bicluster reflects a strong association between a subset of objects and a subset of attributes in a numerical object/attribute data-table. So called biclusters of similar values can be thought as maximal sub-tables with close values. Only few methods address a complete, correct and non redundant enumeration of such patterns, which is a well-known intractable problem, while no formal framework exists. In this paper, we introduce important links between biclustering and formal concept analysis. More specifically, we originally show that Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA), provides a nice mathematical framework for biclustering. Interestingly, existing algorithms of TCA, that usually apply on binary data, can be used (directly or with slight modifications) after a preprocessing step for extracting maximal biclusters of similar values.","Numerical biclustering; Scaling; Triadic concept analysis","Data mining; Gene expression; Information analysis; Bi-clustering; Data mining tasks; Formal framework; Gene Expression Data; Mathematical frameworks; Pre-processing step; Scaling; Triadic concept analysis; Formal concept analysis",,"Vychodil V.Napoli A.","CEUR-WS",16130073,9782905267788,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924202145

We study the generalization of association rule mining within arbitrary n-ary relations and thus Boolean tensors instead of Boolean matrices. Indeed, many datasets of interest correspond to relations whose number of dimensions is greater or equal to 3. However, just a few proposals deal with rule discovery when both the head and the body can involve subsets of any dimensions. A challenging problem is to provide a semantics to such generalized rules by means of objective interestingness measures that have to be carefully designed. Therefore, we discuss the need for different generalizations of the classical confidence measure. We also present the first algorithm that computes, in such a general framework, every rule that satisfies both a minimal frequency constraint and minimal confidence constraints. The approach is tested on real datasets (ternary and 4-ary relations). We report on a case study that deals with analyzing a dynamic graph thanks to rules.

The combination of data mining techniques and a pipeline to process data from Web 2.0 applications, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Wordpress, makes it possible to apply natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate partially this task. Therefore, the amount of manual classification is reduced, as the incoming data has already a classification tag that can be easily changed, feeding back the classifier. There is room for improvements and a Brazilian Portuguese Corpus was created to do the initial training of the classifier.

Related research typically addresses the problems of indexing, clustering, classification, summarization, and anomaly detection. There is a wide range of techniques to describe and compare time series, but they focus on series' values. This paper concentrates on a new aspect-that of describing oscillation patterns. It presents a technique for time series similarity search, and multiple temporal scales, defining a descriptor that uses the angular coefficients from a linear segmentation of the curve that represents the evolution of the analyzed series. This technique is generalized to handle co-evolution, in which several phenomena vary at the same time. Preliminary experiments with real datasets showed that our approach correctly characterizes the oscillation of single time series, for multiple time scales, and is able to compute the similarity among sets of co-evolving series. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Oscillation of series; Series co-evolution; Time series descriptor; Time series similarity computation","Angular coefficients; Anomaly detection; Co-evolution; Descriptors; Linear segmentation; Multiple time scale; Oscillation behavior; Oscillation of series; Oscillation patterns; Real data sets; Similarity search; Single time series; Temporal Data; Temporal scale; Time series; data mining; data processing; data set; GIS; segmentation; temporal analysis; time series","Medeiros, C.

Opinion Mining is a subfield of Data Mining which aims at automatically classify opinions with respect to their polarity, i.e., to infer if the author of an opinion has either a positive or negative sentiment about some subject (e.g., a movie, a car model, an appliance, etc). A common approach in the opinion mining task is to preprocess the collection of opinion texts used as training set in order to remove the sentences of an opinion that do not contain subjective content. These so called subjective extracts, one for each opinionated text, are then used in a second step to train a polarity classifier, that is used to predict the orientation of the original opinion (positive or negative). In this paper, we propose a new method for the subjectivity detection step of the opinion mining task. Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging each sentence of an opinionated text, and on the use of lexical resources to better generate the corresponding subjective extract. We take advantage of WordNet and SentiWordNet, two publically available lexical resources, to calculate the association degrees between sentences of an opinionated document in the subjectivity detection step. We use well-known movie review datasets (from the Internet Movie Database) to provide comparative experiments and we show a statistically significant increase in classification accuracy of the resulting opinion mining system that can be up to 9%.","Document classification; Opinion mining; Subjectivity detection","Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Knowledge engineering; Marketing; Model automobiles; Motion pictures; Classification accuracy; Comparative experiments; Document Classification; Feedback mechanisms; Internet movie database; Negative sentiments; Opinion mining; Part of speech tagging; Data mining",,"Rodrigues L.White B.Isaias P.Santoro F.M.","IADIS",,9789898533012,,,"English","Proc.

An essential part of this process is the reconstruction and analysis of the evolutionary histories of these complex, dynamic networks. Unfortunately, the methodologies for representing and exploiting such complex evolutionary histories in large scale studies are currently limited. Here, we propose a new formalism, called EvoluCode (Evolutionary barCode), which allows the integration of different evolutionary parameters (eg, sequence conservation, orthology, synteny.) in a unifying format and facilitates the multilevel analysis and visualization of complex evolutionary histories at the genome scale. The advantages of the approach are demonstrated by constructing barcodes representing the evolution of the complete human proteome. Two large-scale studies are then described: (i) the mapping and visualization of the barcodes on the human chromosomes and (ii) automatic clustering of the barcodes to highlight protein subsets sharing similar evolutionary histories and their functional analysis. The methodologies developed here open the way to the efficient application of other data mining and knowledge extraction techniques in evolutionary systems biology studies.

Experts recognise that some combinations of cropping can produce synergistic effects that can lead to profits or losses, depending on the factors of production involved. However, the analysis of the results of cropping multiple varieties simultaneously involves a space of possibilities whose treatment is not trivial. Among the alternatives available for analysing such a problem, this study explored the Combinatorial Neural Model (CNM) which ensures the generation of hypotheses for all possible combinations, according to the parameters set to the model. The study is based on data collected from farms in Brasília, Brazil. First, a preprocessing on the data is presented in order to provide information on the data nature and distribution, and some univariate and bidimensional analysis is shown. Next, the results generated by CNM are explored and the research limits and future work are discussed.

These references can be represented by several formats and styles. Considerable content variations can occur in some metadata fields such as title, author names and publication venue. Besides, it is quite common to find references that omit same metadata fields such as page numbers. Duplicate entries influence the quality of digital library services once they need to be appropriately identified and treated. This paper presents a comparative analysis among different data classification algorithms used to identify duplicated bibliographic metadata records. We have investigated the discovered patterns by comparing the rules and the decision tree with the heuristics adopted in a previous work. Our experiments show that the combination of specific-purpose similarity functions previously proposed and classification algorithms represent an improvement up to 12% when compared to the experiments using our original approach.","Bibliographic metadata; Classification; Deduplication; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Bibliographic retrieval systems; Bibliographies; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Digital libraries; Learning systems; Metadata; Bibliographic references; Classification algorithm; Comparative analysis; Content variation; Data classification; De duplications; Scientific articles; Similarity functions; Data mining",,"Rodrigues L.White B.Isaias P.Santoro F.M.","IADIS",,9789898533012,,,"English","Proc.

Consequently, the demand for extraction of useful information from heterogeneous sources has led organizations to use data and text mining techniques, among which association rule mining is widely used. However, one of the major problems arising from the use of large data sources is the considerable amount of rules produced, which makes manual analysis of data patterns a highly complex task. Another challenge is the semantic (or concept) extraction of unstructured text data in a way that it may combine with structured data. Therefore, this study proposes a method for mining association rules from structured and unstructured data. During this process, ontology is used for semantic interpretation of unstructured data. To determine its feasibility in real-life situations, the proposed method was applied to a database of police reports of a government institution.","Association rules; Concepts; Data mining; Ontologies; Text mining","Association rules; Extraction; Ontology; Semantics; Concepts; Government institutions; Heterogeneous sources; Internet communication; Mining associations; Semantic interpretation; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Data mining",,"Rodrigues L.White B.Isaias P.Santoro F.M.","IADIS",,9789898533012,,,"English","Proc.

With the 2D CRS method, faster and cheaper determination is possible. The complete set of CRS parameters can be extracted from seismic data by an application of modern local-slope-extraction techniques. The necessary information about the CRS parameters is contained in the slopes of the common-midpoint section at the central point and one or several common-offset sections in its vicinity. We studied two procedures for the CRS parameter extraction technique. Their difference lies in the way the common-offset parameters are determined. One technique requires slope-derivative information (a possible source of instability); the other uses slope information at two different locations and less data redundancy. Testing on a synthetic data example proved that the procedures are sufficiently robust to allow for high-quality extraction of all CRS parameters from the extracted slope fields. In this way, the CRS parameter extraction can be sped up by several orders of magnitude as compared to the conventional procedure based on coherence analysis along trial surfaces. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Data mining; Extraction; Parameter extraction; Seismology; Coherence analysis; Common mid points; Common reflection surfaces; Derivative information; Extraction techniques; Orders of magnitude; Slope information; Source of instability; Seismic prospecting; data quality; estimation method; parameterization; seismic data; seismic reflection; slope; stacking; travel time","Santos, L.; University of Campinas, Department of Applied Mathematics, IMECC, Campinas, Brazil; email: lucio@ime.unicamp.br",,"Society of Exploration Geophysicists",00168033,,GPYSA,,"English","Geophysics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857273077

This process may be costly and may not lead to good clusterings, since important information is likely to be discarded. In this paper we propose constrained clustering as a strategy for integrating data sources without losing any information. It basically consists of adding the complementary data sources as constraints that the algorithm must satisfy. As a concrete application of our approach, we focus on the problem of enzyme function prediction, which is a hard task usually performed by intensive experimental work. We use constrained clustering as a means of integrating information from diverse sources as constraints, and analyze how this additional information impacts clustering quality in an enzyme clustering application scenario. Our results show that constraints generally improve the clustering quality when compared to an unconstrained clustering algorithm.

OntoUML is an example of a conceptual modeling language whose metamodel has been designed to comply with the ontological distinctions and axiomatic theories put forth by a theoretically well-grounded Foundational Ontology. However, despite its growing adoption, OntoUML has been deemed to pose a significant complexity to novice modelers. This paper presents a number of theoretical and methodological contributions aimed at assisting these modelers. Firstly, the paper explores a number of design patterns which are derived from the ontological foundations of this language. Secondly, these patterns are then used to derive a number of model construction rule sets. The chained execution of these rule sets assists the modeler in the instantiation of these patterns, i.e., in the use of OntoUML as pattern-language. Thirdly, the article demonstrates how these rule sets can be materialized as a set of methodological guidelines which can be directly implemented in a tool support in the form of an automated dialogue with the novice modeler. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Data mining; FORTH (programming language); Information systems; Models; Ontology; Systems engineering; Axiomatic theory; Conceptual model; Conceptual modeling languages; Design Patterns; Domain analysis; Foundational ontologies; Inductive modeling; Meta model; Methodological contributions; Methodological guidelines; Model construction; Ontological foundation; Rule set; Tool support; Design","Guizzardi, G.; Ontology and Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO), Computer Science Department, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)Brazil; email: gguizzardi@inf.ufes.br",,"Springer Verlag",18651348,9783642220555,,,"English","Lect.

In recent years, advances in accuracy and velocity have enhanced 3D models, but these stand-alone data do not provide the feature extraction. High density point clouds can be obtained with terrestrial laser scanner and by means of modelling and processing techniques, objects features can be constructed. Generally researchers use the geometric information for extracting object characteristics. This paper describes a methodology to use not only the geometrical information but also the intensity data provided during the scan process. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to extract façades from laser scanner data. The proposed method uses mathematical morphology to classify, segment and extract the borders of principal features of the building ""Quinones de León country mansion"" in the city of Vigo, Galicia, Spain. Furthermore, the final result shows huge potential of the intensity data solution to extract the main features of façades and together with the K-means algorithm for segmentation and mathematical morphology operators.

This issue has been widely studied in recent years, with a prominent approach being based on the application of classification techniques. Basically, messages are classified according to the implicit attitude of the writer with respect to a query term. A major concern, however, is that Twitter (and other media channels) follows the data stream model, and thus the classifier must operate with limited resources, including labeled data for training classification models. This imposes serious challenges for current classification techniques, since they need to be constantly fed with fresh training messages, in order to track sentiment drift and to provide up-to-date sentiment analysis. We propose solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is a training augmentation procedure which takes as input a small training seed, and then it automatically incorporates new relevant messages to the training data. Classification models are produced on-the-fly using association rules, which are kept up-to-date in an incremental fashion, so that at any given time the model properly reflects the sentiments in the event being analyzed. In order to track sentiment drift, training messages are projected on a demand-driven basis, according to the content of the message being classified. Projecting the training data offers a series of advantages, including the ability to quickly detect trending information emerging in the stream. We performed the analysis of major events in 2010, and we show that the prediction performance remains about the same, or even increases, as the stream passes and new training messages are acquired. This result holds for different languages, even in cases where sentiment distribution changes over time, or in cases where the initial training seed is rather small. We derive lower-bounds for prediction performance, and we show that our approach is extremely effective under diverse learning scenarios, providing gains that range from 7% to 58%.","Sentiment analysis; Sentiment drift; Streams; Twitter","Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Classification models; Classification technique; Implicit attitudes; Prediction performance; Sentiment distributions; Sentiment drift; Streams; Twitter; Classification (of information)","Silva, I.S.; Computer Science Department, Federal University of Minas Gerais, 31270-901 Belo Horizonte, Brazil; email: ismael.silva@dcc.ufmg.br",,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450309349,,,"English","SIGIR - Proc.

Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR. © 2011 IEEE.","Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE); Study selection activity; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visual text mining (VTM)","Software engineering; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Research questions; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text mining; Time spent; Visual text minings (VTM); Data mining","Felizardo, K.R.; Depart. of Computer Science, University of São PauloBrazil; email: katiarf@icmc.usp.br",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.
