Therefore, the authors propose an Institutional Teaching Evaluation model that applies, among others, the Sentiment Analysis to identify which teaching practices are positive or negative from the perspective of students from a Higher Education Institution. Differently than the current Institutional Teaching Evaluation models, which are founded on the evaluators' assumptions, this model responds to the need of better pedagogical practices through data mining, finding new categories of analysis in the discourse of a group of students to contribute to the conception of a more effective Teaching Evaluation and to create awareness about teaching practices.","","978-1-5090-4596-9","10.1109/SIIE.2016.7751829","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751829","Sentiment Analysis;Educational Data Mining;Institutional Teaching Evaluation","Education;Data mining;Data models;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Semantics;Standards","data mining;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;further education;sentiment analysis;teaching","education data mining;teaching practices evaluation;institutional teaching evaluation model;sentiment analysis;student perspective;higher education institution;pedagogical practices","","1","","9","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To pursue this goal, DIE regularly has to analyze large volumes of data to search for anomalies that can reveal suspicious activities. With the growing demand from the citizens for transparency and corruption prevention, DIE is constantly looking for new methods to automate these processes. In this work, we investigate IT purchases anomalies in the Federal Government Procurement System by using a deep learning algorithm to generate a predictive model. This model will be used to prioritize actions carried out by the office in its pursuit of problems related to this kind of purchases. The data mining process followed the CRISP-DM methodology and the modeling phase tested the parallel resources of the H2O tool. We evaluated the performance of twelve deep learning with auto-encoder models, each one generated under a different set of parameters, in order to find the best input data reconstruction model. The best model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0012775 and was used to predict the anomalies over the test file samples.","","978-1-5090-6167-9","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0129","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838233","deep learning;auto-encoder;anomaly detection;data mining;machine learning;procurement system;corruption prevention;CRISP-DM;H2O","Government;Machine learning;Data mining;Data models;Water;Procurement;Predictive models","data mining;government data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;procurement;purchasing;resource allocation","MSE;mean squared error;input data reconstruction model;auto-encoder models;H2O tool parallel resources;CRISP-DM methodology;data mining process;Federal Government Procurement System;corruption prevention;CGU;Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General;DIE;Department of Research and Strategic Information;deep learning;Brazilian government procurement system;IT purchase anomaly identification","","3","","40","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, in this presentation we report on the refinement of those adhesive force measurements by gaining and including information on the contact area of those particles with the surface, the specific chemistry of interactive surfaces, and the quantification of the force values using materials standard. We also investigate the adhesive forces holding the soiling particles together and the effects of the critical parameters of surface compositional properties, moisture (humidity), and hydrocarbons. This allows for the comparisons of the inter-particle adhesion to the adhesive force holding the particle to the glass module surface.

Nevertheless, even considering the efforts to reduce the number of women deaths due to problems related to pregnancy, this decrease presented less impact than other areas of human development. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, account for significant proportion of perinatal morbidity and maternal mortality. In this context, this paper proposes an inference model that uses data mining (DM) techniques capable for operating in a data set to extract patterns and assist in knowledge discovery. Identifying hypertensive crises that complicate pregnancy, it can impact in a meaningful reduction the incidence of sequelae and death of pregnant women. Comparison between two Bayesian classifiers is performed in this work to better classify the hypertensive disorders severity. Results showed that Naïve Bayes classifier had an excellent performance, presenting better precision and F-measure, compared to the other experimented classifiers.

An energy market forecast is designed by the utilities and this forecast has to be a 100% covered with contracts agreed from regulated trades. The challenge of utilities is to forecast their own energy market five years in advance, which brings to the process a high level of uncertainty. This paper presents a methodology for planning the purchase of electricity by distribution agents in the Brazilian regulated contracting environment (ACR). The contracting strategy covers a horizon of 5 years, with monthly discretization and the goal is to minimize the total cost of energy procurement strategy. The proposed model considers the current regulatory Brazilian Laws of energy contracting by distribution companies, i.e. energy purchases from auctions in the regulated environment, distributed generation - GD, Compensation Mechanism Surplus and Deficit - MCSD and short-term market. The uncertainties of future electric consumption are modeled following a fuzzy approach. Thus, the formulation if proposed model is a fuzzy non-linear programming problem. Results show the importance of the short-term modeling and the consideration of MCSD and GD in the Energy Purchase Strategy on the Brazilian Regulated Electricity Market.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2016.7437217","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437217","Brazilian Electricity Market;Distribution companies;Energy Purchase Strategy;Fuzzy non-linear programming;Short-Term Market","Electricity supply industry;Companies;Computational modeling;Distributed power generation;Uncertainty;Programming;Contracts","commerce;fuzzy set theory;nonlinear programming;power markets","fuzzy nonlinear programming problem;energy procurement strategy;ACR;Brazilian regulated contracting environment;energy market;distributed generation;regulated auctions;fuzzy model;Brazilian regulated electricity market;energy purchasing strategy","","","","","","21 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Jumping emerging patterns have been used to flat classification and in this work we explore its adoption in a hierarchical classification scenario.

Although these innovations come as a car performance improvement, it can also have adverse effects (some related to safety) in case of malfunction. These undesirable behaviors can be caused by Electromagnetic Interferences (EMI), and the probability increases when a large number of electro-electronic components act together in the same environment, causing failures that may damage part or the whole system. In Brazil, the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) validation of these systems is currently a relative option and the decision of testing or not (and how deep) is up to each car manufacturer. Moreover, most of these validations are still realized out of Brazil, turning developments more expensive, more time-consuming and underusing Brazilian metrology chain.

Knowledge bases (KB) used in most projects are represented in an ontology-based fashion, so the data can be better organized and easily accessible. It is common to map these KBs into a graph when trying to induce inference rules from the KB, thus it is possible to apply graph-mining techniques to extract implicit knowledge. One common graph-based task is link prediction, which can be used to predict edges (new facts for the KB) that will appear in a near future. In this paper, we present Graph Rule Learner (GRL), a method designed to extract inference rules from ontological knowledge bases mapped to graphs. GRL is based on graph-mining techniques, and explores the combination of link prediction metrics. Empirical analysis revealed GRL can successfully be applied to NELL(Never-Ending Language Learner) helping the system to infer new KB beliefs from existing beliefs (a crucial task for a never-ending learning system).","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.070","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839611","Machine Learning;Graph Mining;Ontologies;Ontological Knowledge Bases;Inference Rules","Knowledge based systems;Measurement;Inference algorithms;Urban areas;Data mining;Feature extraction;Electronic mail","data mining;graph theory;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","inference rule extraction;ontological knowledge bases;data availability;Web availability;semantic Web;graph-mining techniques;implicit knowledge extraction;graph-based task;graph rule learner;GRL;link prediction metrics;never-ending language learner;NELL;KB beliefs;never-ending learning system","","1","","15","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this area, we can find solutions using multiple sensors simultaneously supporting the real time data acquisition. In the other hand, there are researchers focusing in an optimized and accurate way to classify the activity based on large amount of data. In this paper the Bayes Network and Neural Network classifiers were used. They were built from a public dataset regarding data acquired from accelerometers worn by a set of people. Considering the Data Mining classification steps, the attributes selection, the building and training, the validation tests were done, resulting in the Confusion Matrix, the accuracy rate and the processing time. The goal is to compare different classification methods using different building and training techniques, matching the dataset specifications and quirks, assessing the performance and accuracy rates impacts. A Java program was implemented using the Data Mining public library called Weka. With smaller processing times than the Bayes Network, the implemented Neural Networks had excellent results. The Bayes Network requires a further investigation on configuration and validation techniques, it had the largest processing times, and reached the best results using the k-fold cross-validation technique.","","978-1-5090-4093-3","10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603339","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7603339","Human Activity Recognition;Data Mining;Classifiers;Bayes Network;Neural Network","Training;Graphical user interfaces;Accelerometers;Java;Libraries;Neural networks;Sensors","accelerometers;belief networks;data mining;Java;neural nets;pattern classification;sensor fusion;ubiquitous computing","classification method;Bayes network classifier;neural network classifier;human activity recognition;context awareness;multiple sensor;accelerometer data;Java program;data mining","","6","","9","","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By reconfiguring the distribution network, it is possible to isolate faults and transfer loads to other healthy feeders. There are different approaches of Advanced Distribution Automation (ADA) that allows a better monitoring and control of the electrical grids, making it able to take automatic decisions. One of these approaches regards on subroutines using conditional logics at the SCADA system level, in order to accomplish fast and automatic load transfer considering remotely controlled reclosers placed along the defective feeder (Normally Closed reclosers) and between neighboring feeders (Normally Opened reclosers). Such ADA approach was evaluated in a Smart Grid laboratory, where the systemic environment of a power distribution company was reproduced.

Methods based on DTW have achieved significant results in time-series data mining. The original DTW method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classification. It disregards the temporal range when finding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a specific phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classifier needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original DTW method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classification using DTW. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2517118","Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster (Germany); Earth System Science Center, National Institute for Space Research (Brazil); CAPES; FAPESP e-science; CNPq; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403907","Dynamic programming;image sequence analysis;monitoring;pattern classification;time series","Time series analysis;Agriculture;Remote sensing;Satellites;Earth;Shape;Data mining","data mining;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;time series","shape matching;forest area;land cover classifier;time series data mining;remote sensing image time series;land cover classification;land use classification;land cover mapping;land use mapping;time-weighted dynamic time warping method","","47","","47","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These inspections are currently done by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or by divers but they are time-consuming, expensive and need to be planned a long time in advance. Therefore a current trend in the offshore industry is to look into sub-sea resident autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as inspection systems. There is a big difference between the currently available survey AUVs and inspection AUVs with respect to their primary mission capabilities. Whereas a survey AUV needs to map a wide area and have a high precision relative position between the scans, an inspection class AUV needs to find the inspection targets repeatedly.

Additionally, none of the studies we have found studied APAs in CALL systems lecturing about the English present perfect tense, which is considered one of the main issues Brazilian students face when learning English as a foreign language. This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of an APA integrated to a CALL system to help Brazilian students of English as a foreign language learn the present perfect tense. Thirty-nine Brazilian undergraduate students were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups, to evaluate whether the addition of an APA with features like talking, moving and pointing helps students improve performance.

In spite of the availability of the sources, the region has been characterized with the lack of electricity and, consequently, has a higher level of poverty in the country. Reasons include very low rural electrification, low electricity demand, topographical difficulties, dispersed communities, and small investments to Amazon region which is not supplied by regular. This paper investigates the possibility of using renewable energy based microgrids as an option to electrify in remote areas, in the state of Amazonas. The load profile is generated based on the local information and the available loads. Renewable energy sources such as solar and hydro are utilized in the design of hybrid off-grid microgrid systems. Then, the system is modeled in HOMER. The simulations are run to obtaion an optimal microgrid configuration for Torre da Lua which is an isolated community in the Brazilian Amazon. It is shown that renewable energy based microgrid concept can be utilized to meet the local demand and electrify these isolated communities in a feasible and clean way.","","978-1-5090-2547-3","10.1109/PECON.2016.7951462","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7951462","Brazilian Amazon;Renewable Energy;Rural Electrification;Microgrid;HOMER;Torre da Lua;Hybrid Scheme;Off-grid","Microgrids;Renewable energy sources;Generators;Solar radiation;Rivers;Urban areas;Companies","distributed power generation;hybrid power systems;hydroelectric power;solar power","microgrids;Brazilian Amazon;rural electrification;electricity demand;Amazonas;renewable energy sources;hybrid off-grid microgrid systems;HOMER;Torre da Lua","","","","24","","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of these tools has been gaining success in the power sector by their ability to observe and model interdependences and feedbacks between the different system variables. This kind of approach was then implemented in many power systems. The work is introducing new features to this approach based on specific characteristics of the Brazilian Power System, namely: the large penetration of hydropower and the possibility of energy storage; seasonality of power generation; existence of electricity submarkets with transmissions constraints between them. The results obtained so far show that the Dynamic System developed can represent in good conditions the main features of the Brazilian system, whereas it identifies and correctly shows patterns of water management and energy prices that comply with the reality.

Therefore, it is important that utilities perform the service for emergency occurrences as quickly as possible, reducing the time of the outage. Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) requires the utilities send every month their average service time, regulating the quality of the service, and determines the maximum length of interruptions for each set of Consumer Units and also their maximum quantity of occurrences. Therefore, reducing measures in service time is a great interest of utilities. The installation of smart meters allows that the distribution company be informed of the interruption at the same time it occurs, also determining the fault location, everything because of two-way flow of information between the meter and the control center. Thus, the time of fault location is reduced, resulting in reducing the time of the occurrence service and total interruption time for those consumers achieved. Thus, there is impact on the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), increasing system reliability. In addition to this gain, there is a reduction of expected energy not supplied (EENS).

The method yields an assessment of the location of the nontechnical losses now and in the future at the city subarea level, even indicating the variables that have greater statistical correlation with the nontechnical losses. We apply the method to a city with approximately 81,000 consumers, and the results are compared with those obtained through inspections carried out by a Brazilian power utility.

However, the simple average of these three aspects and the classification of the cities in four categories, as previously defined, may not actually represent natural groups that these cities are included. Therefore, by means of an unsupervised classification, such as the clustering data analysis, it is proposed to examine whether there are natural groupings of cities the basic aspects mentioned. For this, we used the hierarchical method WARD and the non-hierarchical k-means method, with the criteria of validation width silhouette (SWC) and sum of squared errors (SSE) to find groups of municipalities in three basic aspects of development. For validated statistically were used Monte Carlo analysis width criterion of silhouette, under the null hypothesis that the data were random.

Two hopping conduction mechanisms were observed starting from Mott-VRH and transiting to ES-VRH as temperature drops. The analysis of the hopping conduction allows extracting the values of electrical transport parameters in the NWs. The average doping levels were found to change from nanowire to nanowire. This anomaly was explained in terms of variations of growth rate from wire to wire due to the characteristic growth mechanism of free-standing nanowires, as well as due to the polytypism in the NWs.","","978-1-5090-2788-0","10.1109/SBMicro.2016.7731333","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7731333","GaAs;Nanowires;Polytypism;Molecular Beam Epitaxy","Gallium arsenide;Nanowires;Temperature;Field effect transistors;Doping;Temperature measurement;Temperature dependence","gallium arsenide;hopping conduction;III-V semiconductors;molecular beam epitaxial growth;nanowires;semiconductor doping","electronic transport;p-type doped nanowires;hopping conduction;electrical transport parameters;doping levels;GaAs","","","","27","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was shown in [5] that some by-products of SF6 may interact with the sealing materials of SF6-insulated equipment, leading to gas leaks. A CIGRE study [4] revealed that, between 1991 and 1998, 40% of failures in SF6-insulated high voltage equipment were caused by leaks. IEC 62271-303 [6] stipulates that SF6 gas leakage should not exceed 0.5% of the mass of the gas contained in the relevant equipment.

At faint magnitudes, the separation between pointy and extended sources is fuzzy, which makes SGSP a hard task. This problem is even harder for large surveys like Dark Energy Survey (DES) and, in a near future, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) due to their large data volume. Hence, the search for classification methods that are both accurate and efficient is highly relevant. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of several machine learning methods targeted at solving the SGSP at faint magnitudes. In order to train the classification models, the COSMOS survey was used. We use machine learning methods as distinct as artificial neural networks, k nearest-neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Naive Bayes. The exploratory process was modeled as data centric workflow. The workflow was implemented on top of Hadoop framework and was used to find the best parameter values for each classification method we considered, of which neural networks and random forest present superior performance.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-0620-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727189","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727189","","Neural networks;Learning systems;Support vector machines;Telescopes;Training;Extraterrestrial measurements;Spatial resolution","astronomy computing;Bayes methods;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;parallel processing;support vector machines","machine learning methods;star-galaxy separation problem;SGSP;dark energy survey;DES;large synoptic survey telescope;LSST;classification models;artificial neural networks;ANN;k nearest-neighbor;support vector machines;SVM;random forests;Naive Bayes;data centric workflow;exploratory process;Hadoop framework","","1","","44","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, surprisingly little progress has been made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for two time series data mining problems, including motif discovery and novelty discovery.","2374-8486","978-1-5090-5473-2","10.1109/ICDM.2016.0179","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837992","Time Series;Similarity Joins;Motif Discovery","Time series analysis;Approximation algorithms;Euclidean distance;Data mining;Indexes;Clustering algorithms;Text processing","data mining;matrix algebra;search problems;time series","matrix profile;time series;shapelets;all-pairs-similarity-search;datatypes;time series subsequences;nested-loop algorithm;modest sized datasets;time series discord problem;time series motif;time series data mining problems;motif discovery;novelty discovery;scalable algorithm;exact similarity join algorithm","","77","","24","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying a language variety may positively impact various Natural Language Processing tasks, but accomplishing this task is still regarded as one of the bottlenecks in this area, especially when combined with another bottleneck, language identification applied to short texts.

The actual energy resources management is executed using the SCADA House Intelligent Management (SHIM) system, which schedules the use of the different resources, taking into account the suggested reduction amount. A case study is presented, using data from Brazilian consumers. Several scenarios are considered, representing different combinations concerning the type of house/inhabitants, the season, the type of used energy tariff, the use of Photovoltaic system (PV) generation, and the maximum amount of allowed reduction.

We show that this approach improves the classification accuracy compared to other methods, including those such preprocessing techniques are applied separately to the database.","","978-1-5090-5105-2","10.1109/LA-CCI.2016.7885729","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885729","text mining;sentiment analysis;machine learning;support vector machine;preprocessing techniques;filter;wrapper","Databases;Text mining;Support vector machines;Sentiment analysis;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering","data mining;feature selection;genetic algorithms;information filtering;Internet;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;support vector machines","Web-based review;hybrid filter-wrapper approach;sentiment polarity classification;two-phase feature selection method;data mining filter;genetic algorithm;support vector machine classifier;sentiment analysis;Internet Movie Database;IMDb reviews","","1","","28","","27 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pattern discovery in data produced by Learning Management Systems (LMS) elicits important information about the educational process, especially when considering correlations between stakeholders interacting in different perspectives of the LMS like grades, access, forum or message communications. In this paper, we propose a data and metadata model for Learning Analytics applications using data from LMS. This model is LMS independent and supports Business Intelligence and Data Mining applications for decision-making in the educational context. Our model considers the use of historical data from LMS treated under three perspectives that can be analyzed individually or correlated. The model also allows analysis considering different stakeholders (student, educator, etc.) and levels of granularity (institution, department, course, discipline, etc.). In this sense, the proposed model allows consistent and correlated analysis of data from LMSs. As a result, our model effective collaborates with the educational process through an efficient decision-making.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757743","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757743","","Stakeholders;Analytical models;Context;Metadata;Data mining;Decision making","competitive intelligence;data analysis;data mining;decision making;learning management systems","multidimensional data model;learning management systems;decision-making process;educational context;blended learning;pattern discovery;LMS;educational process;message communications;learning analytics applications;business intelligence;data mining applications;correlated data analysis","","","","26","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 1-NN DTW is typically considered the most accurate model for temporal data. Nevertheless, some authors have recently proposed ingenious alternatives to the 1-NN DTW by using diversity of time series representation or by using DTW for feature extraction. In this paper, we explore diversity of time series representations and distance functions to obtain distance features, which in turn are used to train an SVM model. We argue that the scientific community has largely neglected a vast body of unconventional distance functions, and we present empirical evidence that distance features are better than the 1-NN DTW with respect to classification accuracy.","","978-1-5090-6167-9","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0010","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838114","time series;classification;machine learning;time series representation;time series classification","Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Time-frequency analysis;Data mining;Correlation;Transforms","data mining;feature extraction;pattern classification;support vector machines;time series","time series classification;representation diversity;data mining;similarity-based classifiers;1-NN DTW;temporal data;feature extraction;time series representations;distance functions;distance features;SVM model;scientific community","","3","","27","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing approaches analyse the whole object trajectory rather that the current movement. Besides existing approaches for online pattern discovery are restricted to instantaneous positions. Subsequently, they fail to capture the movement behaviour along time. By continuously tracking moving objects sub-trajectories at each time window, rather than just the last position, it becomes feasible to gain insight on the current behaviour, and potentially detect mobility patterns in real time. This demonstration presents a novel framework for online mobility pattern discovery in sub-trajectory data streams. Key innovations include: (i) Online discovery of mobility patterns and pattern evolution by tracking the sub-trajectories of moving objects, (ii) A novel structure, called micro-group, to represent the relationship among moving objects, and (iii) An incremental algorithm to maintain micro-groups and to capture their evolution on highly dynamic sub-trajectory data.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of some tax incentive and market regulation requirements on Brazilian IT companies, using a data set containing 942 firms. We perform empirical studies concerning the influence of two public policy measures on the labor productivity of such companies, estimated through their annual gross revenue per worker ratio. We show that there has been a positive correlation of electronic tax recognition and bookkeeping regulation measures with the labor productivity growth of locally owned suppliers of enterprise resource planning software. Likewise, we show that, on average, the productivity growth of foreign capital hardware manufacturers, while payroll tax reduction benefits were in force, was higher than in other periods. These studies illustrate the temporal and business segment influence that technology requirements might have on the productivity of IT companies when considered in public policy measures and also suggest a future research agenda.","","978-1-5090-3694-3","10.1109/REW.2016.047","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815630","Tax Incentives;Market Regulation;Public Policy;Legal Requirements;Information Technology","Finance;Companies;Software;Productivity;Economics;Government","bookkeeping;business data processing;DP industry;enterprise resource planning;information systems;taxation","tax incentive;market regulation;IT company;information technology industry;Brazilian industry;public policy measure;labor productivity;electronic tax recognition;bookkeeping regulation measure;enterprise resource planning software;business segment","","","","22","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, a general model is proposed that encompasses an analysis of the speed and driving profiles, herein termed speed profile optimisation. This model is validated by empirical simulations with the aid of MATLAB software and the implementation of a genetic algorithm of artificial intelligence using the Java programming language.

Thus, on one hand, it is preferable to assure the adoption of the minimum transmission power in order to extend the WSN lifetime, as far as possible. On the other hand, it is crucial to guarantee that the nodes receive the transmitted data correctly. Therefore, trading off power optimization and quality of service has become one the most important concerns when dealing with modern systems based on WSNs. This paper proposes a new technique based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) focusing on the minimization of energy consumption. The proposed technique adjusts the monitoring timeslot of the sensors according to the environmental changes. The results obtained throughout a WSN simulator show that the implemented technique provides satisfactory results, when compared with classic TDMA techniques. The analyzed scenarios demonstrated improvements regarding the WSN's energy consumption of 17%, in the worst case, and up to 52%, in the most favorable case. The proposed technique reduces the energy consumption of the network and consequently, increases its lifetime.","","978-1-4673-9975-3","10.1109/ICNSC.2016.7478994","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478994","WSN;Energy consumption;TDMA","Energy consumption;Time division multiple access;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Monitoring;Protocols;Timing","energy consumption;optimisation;quality of service;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks","time division multiple access;TDMA techniques;sleep scheduling;wireless sensor network;WSN energy consumption;power supply;transmission power;WSN lifetime;power optimization;quality of service;WSN simulator","","6","","10","","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it can define a User's Behavioral Pattern (PCU) with a particular focus of study. Therefore, this paper presents the work in progress of a doctoral dissertation that will study the time evolution of the use of AS in the publications of Facebook users' profiles. The case study is related to publications data mining of AS for physical activities (Fitness) to correlate healthy habits and physical activity, in order to predict the user healthy behavior and hence an improvement in their quality life. To do this, we are developing a data extraction tool throught an AS to Facebook, and its attractive point is the generation of competitive rankings customized by users and that can be published to your Facebook profile. Given the human competitive nature, it is expected a good spread of use of this AS, which will allow data mining to define the PCU healthy habits, where this PCU can be used to entice users to have a better quality of life and in this sense, decrease physical inactivity and risk for diseases associated with inactivity.","","978-9-8998-4346-2","10.1109/CISTI.2016.7521484","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521484","data mining;social networks;Facebook;social apps;mobile devices;quality of life;inactivity","Facebook;Global Positioning System;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Data mining;Smart phones","data mining;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;social networking (online)","social applications;fitness social apps;Facebook;biosensors;information sharing;AS mobile devices;user behavioral pattern;publications data mining;healthy habits;physical activity;user healthy behavior;data extraction tool","","1","","","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The agents work together in order to restore costumers load after a fault occurs in the utility power grid. The MARS was developed in JADE (Java Agent Development Framework), which is written in Java. Case studies are supposed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed MARS when applied to a medium-voltage power distribution network and a microgrid. The distribution network and the micro grid are modeled in Matlab-Simulink environment, while the communication tools between JADE and Simulink are also developed. Simulation results demonstrate that MARS presents a suitable performance, providing fast and reliable recovery of the power distribution network.

The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor systems is important to monitor and study these biomes because they can acquire data under cloud coverage. In this paper, an advanced land observing system phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar fine-beam dual (ALOS/PALSAR-FBD) image was evaluated for land use and land cover (LULC) classification of an Amazon test site. The features extracted from this image were also evaluated. To perform this task, a method for feature selection, considering the desired classes, was proposed. In order to better understand the applicability of this type of data in Brazilian Government projects (such as DETER-B and TerraClass), the results obtained with SAR images were compared with those from LANDSAT5/TM. The results show that the PALSAR-FBD image and the features selected are not suitable for the discrimination of densely forested classes. They presented, however, a good discrimination among the group of forested and agropastoral classes, as well as among nondensely forested classes (i.e., pastures, bare soil, and new regeneration). Therefore, these data present good applicability for mapping and monitoring of both deforestation and LULC and they can be used in the above mentioned projects. The classification of selected features, with eight classes of interest, achieved an increase of about 133% and 69% in the Kappa index (0.32) and an Overall Accuracy (0.54) regarding the PALSAR-FBD classification (0.136 and 0.322, respectively). This result shows the applicability of the proposed method.

Then we represented the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario and, in particular, apply community discovery techniques in order to identify clusters in the service supply infrastructure.

In this context, understanding and modeling opinions, as well as opinion-leaders, have implications for several tasks, such as recommendation, advertising, brand evaluation etc. Despite the intrinsic relation between opinions and opinion-leaders, most recent works focus exclusively on either understanding the opinions, by Sentiment Analysis (SA) proposals, or identifying opinion-leaders using Influential Users Detection (IUD). This paper presents a preliminary evaluation about a combined analysis of SA and IUD. In this sense, we propose a methodology to quantify factors in real domains that may affect such analysis, as well as the potential benefits of combining SA Methods with IUD ones. Empirical assessments on a sample of tweets about the Brazilian president reveal that the collective opinion and the set of top opinion-leaders over time are inter-related. Further, we were able to identify distinct characteristics of opinion propagation, and that the collective opinion may be accurately estimated by using a few top-k opinion-leaders. These results point out the combined analysis of SA and IUD as a promising research direction to be further exploited.","","978-1-5090-5206-6","10.1109/DSAA.2016.77","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796959","Sentiment Analysis;Influential Users Detection","Sentiment analysis;Twitter;Context;Analytical models;Principal component analysis;Mood","decision making;politics;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","tweets;SA;sentiment analysis;decision making;opinion leaders;Brazilian president;opinion propagation;collective opinion;Twitter;SA methods;IUD;influential user detection;social media;Brazilian political protests","","1","","46","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was necessary to dispatch thermal plants which were primarily used only to supplement power generation. Meanwhile, this type of generation plant significantly contributes to burning fossil fuels. Gas emission intensifies acid rain, global warming and is responsible for climate change, which ultimately deteriorates human health. There are many studies that correlate pollution escalation with increased hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, raising the costs of public health spending. This study aims to establish a method to estimate economic advantages of solar distributed micro generation for homes concerning to the avoided amount spent by the government to mitigate negative effects, specifically pollution-related health problems, from the use of thermal plants.

Most existing approaches cluster the whole trajectories offline. This allows characterizing the past movements of the objects but not current patterns. Recent approaches for online clustering of moving objects location are restricted to instantaneous positions. Subsequently, they fail to capture moving objects' behavior over time. By continuously tracking moving objects' sub-trajectories at each time window, rather than just the last position, it becomes possible to gain insight on the current behavior, and potentially detect mobility patterns in real time. In this work, we tackle the problem of discovering and maintaining the density based clusters in trajectory data streams, despite the fact that most moving objects change their position over time. We propose CUTiS, an incremental algorithm to solve this problem, while tracking the evolution of the clusters as well as the membership of the moving objects to the clusters.

To attend a particular purpose new functions are added or modified according to the mission phase needs, requiring models re-adaptation in a system evolving concept. The process of verification of satellite simulator software requires high-efficiency in accomplishing realistic functional and behavioral requirements. Based on the complex set of requirements the satellite behavior is represented in the simulator through software models specified by tables of cause-effect rules. Considering that the Satellite Simulator is an evolving systems and it needs to assure that the logic implemented in the simulator conforms to the requirements, the manual verification process becomes impracticable, therefore demanding a compatible verification approach. The approach suggested here unifies two techniques Conformance and Fault Inject (CoFI), constructed on Model-Based Testing and Model Checking added to a method so that it can translate the tables of cause-effect rules into finite state machines.

However, the heterogeneity of technology makes interoperability a great development challenge. Moreover, its evaluation for the context-aware system is also not trivial. Considering the relevance of the topic, we performed a characterization research (secondary study) aiming at revealing evidence on how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems (CASS). Despite the observed conceptual divergence on interoperability, we present a set of evidence-based characteristics that can support decision-making and evaluation of interoperability on such systems.

In QoS routing, multiple conflicting objectives are optimized simultaneously. On the other hand, multicasting (i.e. sending data to multiple destinations) in its simplest form is a computationally difficult problem, which becomes more challenging when QoS requirements are considered. Previous works have investigated the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in the multicast routing with QoS problem under a Pareto-dominance approach. In particular, the so-called SPEA2 algorithm has provided good results in problem formulations involving up to four objectives. However, it has been recognized that for higher-dimension problems the convergence of MOEAs can decline substantially. In this work, we propose a model for routing based on the many-objectives algorithm MEAMT (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with many tables), aiming at better dealing with the difficulty faced by state-of-the-art routing methods when solving for higher-dimensional formulations. We present the new model for multicast routing based on MEAMT, as well as report experiments on a comparison with SPEA2-based routing in formulations involving 4, 5 and 6 objectives over several problem instances with different topologies and sizes. The results indicate that the new routing model overcomes SPEA2 in most cases, specially when solving for higher dimensional problems in routing.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.043","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839584","multiobjetivos genetic algorithms;multicast routing;quality of service;evolutionary algorithms","Routing;Quality of service;Delays;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics;Search problems","computer networks;evolutionary computation;multicast communication;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","many-objective evolutionary algorithms;multicast routing model;quality of service problem;end-to-end communication;computer networks;quality of service requirements;QoS requirements;QoS routing;multicasting;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;MOEA;QoS problem;Pareto dominance approach;SPEA2 algorithm;MEAMT","","5","","15","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed grounding system model was implemented in the EMTP-ATP program. A RLC synthetized network is used instead of a constant lumped resistance. The RLC elements are derived from the rational approximation of the grounding system response obtained using a rigorous model based on the direct solution of Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. An application example is presented, showing that the computed overvoltage is sensitive to the frequency dependence of the soil parameters.

The requirements of thermal energy in the distillation process are enormous. The thermodynamic efficiency of the distillation process is less than 10%. It is estimated that 8% of all energy used by U.S. industries is consumed in the distillation process. Energy is responsible for 50 to 60% of the operating costs of refineries while in chemical that proportion varies from 30 to 40%. These data shows the potential of savings that the distillation process can be achieved when the process is subjected to better control and optimized. The Model Based Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control technique with features that solve operational problems present in distillation columns. The MPC can deal with of multivariable systems with interactions and considerable dead times, nonlinearities and restrictions on the variables. One of the most important steps in the MPC is the minimization of an objective function. Different types of objective functions can be used in the MPC control algorithm with specific parameter settings for each type of objective function. In this work, the Wood-Berry model for distillation columns will be used. One MPC control strategy for column using a objective function with economic cost will be implemented. Finally, they will be made adjustments to the parameters of the objective function in order to see how these settings influence the response of the MPC controller.","","978-1-5090-2583-1","10.1109/EAIS.2016.7502507","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502507","distillation;Predictive Control;Objective Function","5G mobile communication;Conferences;Adaptive systems;Intelligent systems","distillation equipment;predictive control","economic cost;objective function;MPC control strategy;model based predictive control;distillation columns;Wood-Berry model","","","","11","","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These networks are intended to simulate the mechanisms that govern how a set of effort commands changes the car's velocity and the direction it is moving. The first neural network receives as input a temporal sequence of current and previous throttle and brake efforts, along with a temporal sequence of the previous car's velocities (estimated by the network), and outputs the velocity that the real car would reach in the next time interval given these inputs. The second neural network estimates the arctangent of curvature (a variable related to the steering wheel angle) that a real car would reach in the next time interval given a temporal sequence of current and previous steering efforts and previous arctangents of curvatures of the car estimated by the network. We evaluated the performance of our simulator using real-world datasets acquired using an autonomous robotic car. Experimental results showed that our simulator was able to simulate in real time how a set of efforts influences the car's velocity and arctangent of curvature. While navigating in a map of a real-world environment, our car simulator was able to emulate the velocity and arctangent of curvature of the real car with mean squared error of 2.2×10-3 (m/s)2 and 4.0×10-5 rad2, respectively.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-0620-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727342","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727342","Car Simulation;Time-delay Neural Networks;Autonomous Cars","Automobiles;Robot sensing systems;Neural networks;Wheels;Mobile robots","automobiles;delays;mobile robots;neural nets","time-delay neural networks;temporal sequence;autonomous robotic car","","3","","28","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main innovation of the proposed method is the use of a quadrature matched filter bank to cluster the harmonics and separate them from the other signal components without the previously knowledge of the signal content.

The OI model is different from the closed model because it encourages innovation, not just with ideas that come from inside of the organization, but, also, with the ones that are outside. When the subject is R&D, in an OI environment, where there is an intense cooperation, the IP rights division is not an easy work. In such context, it is important to have an effective management of such IP rights. In order to develop this task, an action-research was done in the Technological Licensing Office (TLO) that supports the CCM of ITA, in Brazil. Based on this research, it was possible to suggest to the TLO the development of a process to search and identify technologies created at STI, giving the TLO higher proactivity to design guidelines for to the R&D teams in the referred STI.","","978-1-5090-3595-3","10.1109/PICMET.2016.7806692","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806692","","Technological innovation;Technology management;IP networks","industrial property;innovation management;technology management","intellectual property;technology license office;open innovation;Brazil;research and development;R and D;Technological Institute of Aeronautics;scientific and technological institutions","","","","57","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current state-of-the-art works related to MPSoC debugging suffer from poor integration, scalability in data storage, and simple graphical data representation. This work proposes a modular debugging framework to aid the software development for large-scale MPSoCs. The framework contains two parts: back-end and front-end. The back-end contains a generic model for extraction and storage of communication and computation data. The frontend comprises a graphical debugging toolset, which provides intuitive debugging tools for the communication and computation data events. A key point of the proposal is to be generic and applicable to different MPSoC architectures due to the decoupling of the back-end and the front-end components of the framework. A data extraction layer abstracts the MPSoC architecture by defining a standard structure to database insertion. The framework is validated in an MPSoC platform described in SystemC RTL (clock-cycle accurate), addressing MPSoC sizes of up to 400 processors.","","978-1-5090-6113-6","10.1109/ICECS.2016.7841277","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841277","MPSoC;Many-Core;CAD tools;Debugging Tools;Frameworks","Debugging;Databases;Data mining;Software;Monitoring;Computational modeling;Protocols","computer debugging;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;software engineering;system-on-chip","large-scale MPSoCs;hardware debugging;software debugging;MPSoC debugging;data storage scalability;graphical data representation;modular debugging framework;software development;back-end components;front-end components;generic extraction model;communication data storage;computation data storage;graphical debugging toolset;data events;MPSoC architectures;data extraction layer;SystemC RTL;clock-cycle accuracy","","2","","11","","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides that, algorithms of instance selection can also be applied for removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances, before applying learning algorithms. In the last years, several approaches for instance selection have been proposed. However, most of them have high time complexity and, due to this, they cannot be used for dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we present an algorithm called CDIS that can be viewed as an improvement of a recently proposed density-based approach for instance selection. The main contribution of this paper is a formal characterization of a novel density function that is adopted by the CDIS algorithm. The CDIS algorithm evaluates the instances of each class separately and keeps only the densest instances in a given (arbitrary) neighborhood. This ensures a reasonably low time complexity. Our approach was evaluated on 20 well-known data sets and its performance was compared with the performance of 6 state-of-the-art algorithms, considering three measures: accuracy, reduction and effectiveness. For evaluating the accuracy achieved using the datasets produced by the algorithms, we applied the KNN algorithm. The results show that our approach achieves a performance (in terms of balance of accuracy and reduction) that is better or comparable to the performances of the other algorithms considered in the evaluation.","2375-0197","978-1-5090-4459-7","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0090","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814650","Instance selection;Instance reduction;dataset reduction;Machine learning;Data mining;Instance-based learning","Time complexity;Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Noise measurement;Classification algorithms;Search problems","computational complexity;data reduction;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","novel density-based approach;instance selection;data reduction;computational resource reduction;learning process;time complexity;CDIS;density function;KNN algorithm","","6","","20","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common applications range from product recommendation to social networks and protein interaction. One of the main inferences in this types of networks is the guilty-by-association method, where labeled nodes propagate their information throughout the network, towards unlabeled nodes. While there is a widely used algorithm for this context, called Belief Propagation, it lacks the necessary convergence guarantees for loopy-networks. More recently, a new alternative method was proposed, called LinBP and while it solved the convergence issue, the scalability for large graphs that do not fit memory remains a challenge. Additionally, most works that try to use BP considering large scale graphs rely on specific infrastructure such as supercomputers and computational clusters. Therefore we propose a new algorithm, that leverages state-of-the-art asynchronous vertex-centric parallel processing techniques in conjunction with the state-of-the-art BP alternative LinBP, to provide a scalable framework for large graph inference that runs on a single commodity machine. Our results show that our algorithm is up to 200 times faster than LinBP's SQL implementation on tested networks, while achieving the same accuracy rate. We also show that due to the asynchronous processing, our algorithm actually needs less iterations to converge when compared to LinBP when using the same parameters. Finally, we believe that our methodology highlights the yet not fully explored parallelism available on commodity machines, leaning towards a more cost-efficient computational paradigm.","2375-9259","978-1-5090-5910-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0021","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836652","graphs;belief propagation;parallel processing;data analysis","Belief propagation;Convergence;Parallel processing;Algorithm design and analysis;Couplings;Inference algorithms;Computational modeling","graph theory;inference mechanisms","vertex centric asynchronous belief propagation algorithm;large-scale graphs;inference problems;guilty-by-association method;labeled nodes;unlabeled nodes;loopy-networks;LinBP method;BP algorithm;large scale graph scalability;asynchronous vertex-centric parallel processing techniques;large-graph inference;commodity machine","","1","","22","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we study Twitter follower/followee network and how users centralities evolve over time. Our analysis is founded on temporal graphs theory. First, we model Twitter as a temporal network and revisit the concept of shortest path considering the time dimension. We show how to compute closeness and betweenness centralities using fastest paths. Then, we propose a baseline algorithm for mining streams of temporal networks.

One particular type of representation that is very appropriate for these situations is the NetFeatureMap, which describes by means of features the relevant aspects that are inherent to the environment where the agent actuates. In renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. Thus, investigating adequate approaches that perform automatic selection of these features becomes a crucial task. In this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach that automatically selects appropriate features based on the frequency at which they occur in the states explored by the agent in the course of its acting over the environment. Such an approach is based on Frequent Pattern Mining. It is interesting to point out that there also exist Genetic Algorithms-based approaches that successfully cope with the same task. Unlike Genetic Algorithms that use heuristic functions to select the features, the present proposal uses real data contained in a specialized database for performing this task. Under the intent of investigating the efficacy of such a proposal, the authors utilize the domain of Checkers player agents as their case study, since they operate in a competitive environment with a very wide state space. This investigation is performed by means of tournaments in which agents whose features are selected by the approach proposed herein face others whose features are selected either manually or by Genetic Algorithms. The superior performance of the Frequent-Pattern-based agents in the tournaments proves the efficacy of the present proposal.","2375-0197","978-1-5090-4459-7","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0147","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814707","Machine Learning;State Representation;NetFeatureMap;Automated Selection of Features;Frequent Pattern Mining;Checkers","Games;Data mining;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Proposals;History;Feature extraction","data mining;genetic algorithms;multi-agent systems","NetFeatureMap-based representation;frequent pattern mining;specialized database;intelligent agents;checkers player agents;genetic algorithm","","","","18","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this paper is to produce an algorithm capable of finding an adequate solution to this kind of problem in a viable time frame. The proposed heuristic modifies an initial solution through a series of permutation operations with the objective of finding a better solution. Using data and projects from a real Brazilian mine, the algorithm is compared with the current adopted solutions. The algorithm is also used to solve problems of similar classes and its complexity order is estimated. For a collection of 15 projects applied to a medium port mining station, the algorithm is able to find the optimal solution with 93 evaluations of the objective function (in a 3-hour time frame) for the studied instance of the problem.

In the assessment of the interconnected hydrothermal power systems reliability it is adopted a computational model that takes into account uncertainties on the streamflows into the hydro plants reservoirs, random forced outages of generating units and interconnections among subsystems, system load curve and programmed outage of generating units. The model allows both single area and multi-area analysis. The calculated reliability indices can help the identification of possible power system deficiencies to supply the forecasted maximum peak load as well as the computation of power marginal costs in libelarized electricity markets. In addition, it is discussed an approach to estimate the maximum peak load that a hydrothermal generation system can supply considering a multi-area reliability criterion based on adequacy analysis. The obtained results encourage the continuity of studies seeking the establishment of such criterion for hydrothermal interconnected systems.","","978-88-941051-2-4","10.1109/PSCC.2016.7541015","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7541015","expansion planning adequacy analysis;multi-area reliability;hydrothermal systems;peak load","Reliability;Power system reliability;Load modeling;Planning;Reservoirs;Computational modeling","hydrothermal power systems;power generation economics;power generation reliability;power markets;power system interconnection","multiarea reliability concepts;Brazilian power system capacity evaluation;peak load supply;interconnected hydrothermal power systems reliability assessment;computational model;hydro plants reservoirs;generating unit random forced outages;generating units;system load curve;generating unit programmed outage;calculated reliability indices;power system deficiency identification;power marginal cost computation;libelarized electricity markets;maximum peak load estimation","","1","","17","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adoption of the Smart Grid philosophy are leading to changes in such systems, and one is the capability of monitoring systems outages. In this study, we analyzed the repair data (outage duration and cause) from a single substation of a Brazilian Power Distribution System using Lifetime Data Analysis. We investigated the outages duration, or repair time, related to the following different causes of outages: Atmospheric, Environmental, Urban, Operational Needs, and Equipment Failure. We estimated the Survival function using the nonparametric Kaplan-Meyer estimator and modeled the repair time with a three-parameter Weibull distribution. The results indicate that Atmospheric causes are the factor that leads to larger repair time. A better knowledge of the effects of different causes in the duration of electricity interruption can be useful for maintenance planning since it can assist in the targeting of financial and human resources to reduce the impact of long-term outages, thus improving the power distribution quality indicators.","2164-0610","978-1-5090-3792-6","10.1109/ICHQP.2016.7783446","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783446","","Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric measurements;Reliability;Lead;Maintenance engineering;Corrosion;Oxidation","data analysis;maintenance engineering;nonparametric statistics;power distribution faults;power distribution reliability;power supply quality;statistical analysis;Weibull distribution","power distribution quality indicator improvement;long-term outage impact reduction;maintenance planning;electricity interruption duration;three-parameter Weibull distribution;nonparametric Kaplan-Meyer estimator;equipment failure;lifetime data analysis;Brazilian power distribution system single substation;smart grid;repair data modeling;statistical analysis","","3","","27","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many phantom materials have been proposed; most of them use water as solvent, but these materials have disadvantages such as dehydration and low temporal stability. In order to overcome these difficulties, copolymer-in-oil gel was proposed as an inert and stable material; however, speed of sound for these materials are still lower than what is described for most biological tissues. Here, we propose the use of glycerol as an additive to tune the acoustic properties of copolymer-in-oil materials. We manufactured copolymer-in-oil gels using styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS), in a mass concentration of 10%. Two types of paraffinic mineral oil with different viscosities were used. Glycerol was added in a mass concentration range of 0-30%. We performed measurements of density, speed of sound, and acoustic attenuation of the samples. Density of the samples varied between 0.77 ± 0.11 g/cm3 and 0.93 ± 0.13 g/cm3. The acoustic parameters of the phantom samples were dependent on oil viscosity and glycerol concentration. Speed of sound ranged from 1423 ± 9 m/s to 1502 ± 10 m/s and acoustic attenuation from 0.05 dB/cm at 1 MHz to 28.6 dB/cm at 10 MHz. These results are consistent to those found in fat and breast tissues. We conclude that glycerol can be used to control acoustic parameters of copolymer-in-oil gels.","1948-5727","978-1-4673-9897-8","10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728859","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728859","Tissue-mimicking phantom;copolymer-in-oil;glycerol;ultrasound","Oils;Acoustics;Viscosity;Phantoms;Attenuation;Minerals;Ultrasonic imaging","bioacoustics;biomimetics;gels;oils;phantoms;polymer blends","copolymer-in-oil tissue-mimicking material;tunable acoustic properties;glycerol;styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene;mass concentration;viscosities;density measurements;speed of sound;acoustic attenuation;phantom samples;frequency 1 MHz to 10 MHz","","1","","12","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It uses the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm technique and the Step Method in order to optimize all objectives of a given problem, thus providing a greater number of possible solutions. The goals set to the multi-objective function are the maximization of restored customers, minimization of Joule losses and the number of switching maneuvers in the network for the restoration, which are subject to operational constraints. The software features a set of non-dominated solutions, providing the operator with the option to choose from several effective configurations.

As topology may change overtime, Cooperative Communication (CC) techniques have been explored to improve network connectivity. However, CC links are known to have higher energy demands as compared to traditional links. This paper presents a proposal of a new cooperative communication model capable of increasing energy balance of the CC-links while improving network connectivity.

The next step is to test on a test bench, ie a wind independent controlled test environment. A major challenge in developing the test bench for such application is to control the electric drive system used to emulate the wind turbine (WT) in order to accurately reproduce the variations imposed by wind speed similar to the actual operating conditions. Perhaps for this reason, some studies focus specifically on this machine control, without presenting important details of the emulated WECS. Hence, it is impossible to check if the test bench is actually representing the behavior of a real WECS in all its operating range. In this sense, this work aims to model and control a WECS based on permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and compare the simulation results with those obtained on a test bench.

Hydroelectric power plants (HPP) operators in Brazil usually distribute equally the total power required among the generator units available in the plant. However, studies show that this configuration does not guarantee that each generator unit operate close to its optimal operation point. The energy dispatch optimization problem consists in determining which generation units need to be on or off and what is their respective power-set, so that both the overall HPP costs is minimized and the power required by the plant is met. This paper presents a GPU-based parallel implementation of NSGA-II, to solve the energy dispatch problem of a HPP complaying with the real time restrictions posed by the operation of a real HPP from the reception of the power demand to the energy dispatch. Our implementation obtains better solutions than the sequential implementation currently available.","","978-1-5090-0623-6","10.1109/CEC.2016.7744337","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744337","","Graphics processing units;Sociology;Statistics;Instruction sets;Generators;Mathematical model;Kernel","genetic algorithms;graphics processing units;hydroelectric generators;hydroelectric power stations;parallel processing;power distribution;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch","hydraulic sources;Brazil energy production;hydroelectric power plants;NSGA-II;power generator units;optimal operation point;energy dispatch optimization;power generation units;power-set;HPP cost minimization;GPU-based parallel implementation;power demand","","1","","23","","21 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AAS usually rely on tests results to check the program's functional correctness to provide feedback to students. Novice programmers, however, may find it difficult to map such feedback to the root failures' cause in their programs. It can be even more frustrating when the code is “almost right”. In this paper we investigated the use of a fault localization technique on programs produced by students of introductory programming. Our proposed approach is grounded on spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL). The results of our empirical study showed that this lightweight technique is promising. It can be easily adapted to different AAS to generate useful feedback not only to students but also to instructors. We also delineate the scope where SBFL use is jeopardized. The main contribution of this paper is to present the benefits and drawbacks of applying SBFL, in the context of programming learning, as a novel source of information about students' programming assignments faults.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757727","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757727","programming;automated assessment;software fault diagnosis;novices;experimentation","Programming;Context;Software;Object oriented modeling;Computer bugs;Fault diagnosis;Maintenance engineering","computer science education;educational courses;programming","spectrum-based fault localization;novice programs;introductory programming courses;automated assessment systems;AAS;novice programmers;SBFL;programming learning;student programming assignments faults","","","","15","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the medium and long-term assessment, such short-term concerns should be accounted for the system performance [1,2], assuring that investment options will result in more robust and flexible generating configurations that are consequently more secure.

Here, four methods to estimate variations in PA signal amplitude for thermal PA image formation were investigated: peak-to-peak, integral of the modulus, autocorrelation maximum value, and energy of the signal. Changes in PA signal amplitude were evaluated using a 1D window moving across the entire image. PA images were acquired for temperatures ranging from 36°C to 42°C using a phantom immersed in a temperature controlled thermal bath. In terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR), the performance was similar for all algorithms and using larger windows resulted in a higher SNR. Bias varied from 1.5°C to -1.5°C for temperatures 3°C higher than the baseline. In conclusion, four methods were evaluated to optimize PA thermal images formation.","1948-5727","978-1-4673-9897-8","10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728567","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728567","Photoacoustic imaging;Temperature monitoring;Thermal treatments;Thermal Images","Temperature measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Hyperthermia;Temperature dependence;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical optical imaging;biomedical ultrasonics;hyperthermia;phantoms;photoacoustic effect","photoacoustic-based thermal image formation;Gruenesein parameter;phantom;photoacoustic signal amplitude;hyperthermia","","","","21","","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even when they make a difference regarding metaheuristics under this perspective, proposals in literature commonly expose parameters for controlling their behavior such as metaheuristics does. Several internal mechanisms for automatically adapt those parameters can be implemented, but they require extra design effort and their validation no necessarily is generalizable to multiple domains. Such effort is prohibitive for their practical application on decision-support systems. Rather than implementing internal adapting mechanisms, the exploration of automatic parameter configuration through external tools is performed in this work. A new hyper-heuristic implementation based on a elite set of solutions was implemented and automatically configured with SMAC (Sequential Model-Based Algorithm Configuration), a state-of-art tool for automatic parameter configuration. Experiments with and without automated configuration are performed over the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP). Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool for improving the algorithm performance. Additionally, results provided insights that configurations applied over subsets of instances could provide better improvements in the algorithm performance.","","978-1-5090-1735-5","10.1109/ICCCC.2016.7496763","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7496763","hyper-heuristics;automated algorithm configuration;multidimensional knapsack problem;sequential model-based algorithm configuration","Computers;Search problems;Wheels;Problem-solving;Algorithm design and analysis;Context;Conferences","knapsack problems","hyper-heuristics;multidimensional knapsack problem;sequential model-based algorithm configuration;SMAC;automatic parameter configuration","","1","","25","","27 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers have been mining the history of such lists to study communities' behavior, organization, and evolution. A potential threat of this kind of study is that users often use multiple email addresses to interact in a single mailing list. This can affect the results and tools, when, for example, extracting social networks. This issue is particularly relevant for popular and long-term Open Source Software (OSS) projects, which attract participation of thousands of people. Researchers have proposed heuristics to identify multiple email addresses from the same participant, however there are few studies analyzing the effectiveness of these heuristics. In addition, many studies still do not use any heuristics for authors' disambiguation, which can compromise the results. In this paper, we compare six heuristics from the literature using data from 150 mailing lists from Apache Software Foundation projects. We found that the heuristics proposed by Oliva et al. and a Naïve heuristic outperformed the others in most cases, when considering the F-measure metric. We also found that the time window and the size of the dataset influence the effectiveness of each heuristic. These results may help researchers and tool developers to choose the most appropriate heuristic to use, besides highlighting the necessity of dealing with identity disambiguation, mainly in open source software communities with a large number of participants.","","978-1-5090-3806-0","10.1109/ICSME.2016.13","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816480","Email address disambiguation;mailing lists;Apache Software Foundation;mining software repositories","Electronic mail;Birds;Software;Data mining;History;Social network services;Computer science","electronic mail;project management;public domain software;software engineering;software management","mailing list;open source software project;OSS project;email address;disambiguation heuristics;F-measure metric","","13","","32","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, rank aggregation methods are an interesting solution. They can help finding a consensus on which items should be recommended to the user by taking into account the opinion of all available methods. In this direction, this paper proposes ERA (Evolutionary Rank Aggregation), a genetic programming method that outputs an aggregated ranking function built from information extracted from individual input rankings.

In renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. In this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach, based on Association Rules, that automatically selects these features.

In this paper, we give a first step towards building a large repository that records the academic genealogy of researchers across fields and countries. We crawled data from the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) and develop a framework to extract academic genealogy trees from this data and provide a series of analyses that describe the main properties of the academic genealogy trees.

In Brazil, the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) by Normative Resolution 482/2012, encourages the implementation of energy generation (here called micro and mini generation) from renewable sources for their own consumption. The main objective of this work is to illustrate a possible energy management for the consumer side with photovoltaic generation. Thus, the problem can be mathematically modeled as an optimization problem, which allows consumers to manage their energy consumption, according to their priority of use, meeting part of its consumption by photovoltaic generating and also considering different values of energy tariffs. This optimization problem is a linear programming, implemented by a simulator, which is used to analyze scenarios for the consumer and to assist their energy management.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2016.7530417","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530417","energy management by consumer side;Linear Problem;photovoltaic energy;Renewable sources","Energy management;Mathematical model;Photovoltaic systems;MATLAB;Optimization","energy management systems;optimisation;photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;power markets;power transmission;tariffs","consumer energy management;photovoltaic generation;Brazilian market;small renewable energy;energy matrix;energy transmission;distribution infrastructure expansion;government incentives;National Electric Energy Agency;normative resolution 482/2012;energy generation;microgeneration;minigeneration;renewable sources;consumer side;optimization problem;energy tariffs;linear programming","","1","","","","3 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Brazilian government, however, lacks an accurate early warning system to quickly predict future dengue outbreaks. Such system would help health authorities to plan their actions and to reduce the impact of the disease in the country. However, most attempts to model dengue fever use parametric models which enforce a specific expected behaviour and fail to capture the inherent complexity of dengue dynamics. Therefore, we propose a new Bayesian non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes to design an accurate and flexible model that outperforms previous/standard techniques and can be incorporated into an early warning system, specially at cities from Southeast and Center-West regions. The model also helps understanding dengue dynamics in Brazil through the analysis of the covariance functions generated.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.019","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839560","dengue fever;gaussian process;early warning system","Urban areas;Kernel;Meteorology;Diseases;Data models;Predictive models;Correlation","alarm systems;Bayes methods;diseases;Gaussian processes;nonparametric statistics","accurate Gaussian process-based early warning system;dengue fever;mosquito-borne disease;Brazilian territory;parametric models;dengue dynamics complexity;Bayesian nonparametric model;Center-West regions;Southeast regions;covariance function analysis","","4","","14","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a set of features to classify genres of music. The features proposed were obtained by a methodical selection of important features used in the literature of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Besides, we propose a new music dataset called BMD (Brazilian Music Dataset)1, containing 120 songs labeled in 7 musical genres: FoFFó, Rock, Repente, MPB(Música Popular Brasileira - Brazilian Popular Music), Brega, Sertanejo and Disco. An important characteristic of this new dataset compared with others, is the presence of three popular genres in Brazil Northeast region: Repente, Brega and a characteristic genre similar to MPB, which we also call as MPB. We evaluated our proposed features on both datasets: GTZAN and BMD. The proposed approach achieved average accuracy (after 30 runs of 5-fold-cross-validations) of 79.7% for GTZAN and 86.11% for the BMD. Another important contribution of this work is random repetition of cross-validation executions. Most of the papers performs only a single n-fold cross-validation. We criticize that practice and propose, at least, 30 random executions to compute the average accuracy.","2165-3577","978-1-5090-4165-7","10.1109/ICDSP.2016.7868526","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868526","Music Genre Recognition;Audio Signal Processing;Pattern Recognition, Information Retrieval","Feature extraction;Rocks;Support vector machines;Music information retrieval;Rhythm;Electronic mail","emotion recognition;information retrieval;music;pattern classification","robust music genre classification approach;music datasets evaluation;music features;high genre classification accuracies;regional Brazilian music;music information retrieval;MIR;music emotion recognition;MER;BMD;Brazilian music dataset;FoFFó;rock;Repente;MPB;música popular Brasileira;Brazilian popular music;Brega;Sertanejo;Disco;Brazil Northeast region;GTZAN;cross-validation executions;n-fold cross-validation","","2","","24","","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the well-known advantages of rare earth permanent magnet synchronous generators (REPMSG), the high cost of the rare earth permanent magnets represents an important drawback, particularly in competitive markets like the wind power. To reduce the cost of permanent magnet machines it is possible to replace the expensive rare earth materials by ferrite. Once ferrite has low remanent magnetization, flux concentration techniques are used to design a cheaper generator. The designed FePMSG is compared with a reference rare earth (NdFeB) permanent magnet synchronous generator (REPMSG), both with 3 kW, 220 V and 350 rpm. The results, validated with finite element analysis, show that the FePMSG can replace the REPMSG reducing significantly the active material cost.","","978-1-5090-5127-4","10.1109/INDUSCON.2016.7874480","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874480","","Coils;Magnetic flux;Inductance;Permanent magnets;Ferrites;Generators;Rotors","ferrite devices;permanent magnet generators;remanence;synchronous generators","low remanent magnetization;flux concentration;FePMSG;ferrite permanent magnet synchronous generator;power 3 kW;voltage 220 V","","1","","17","","9 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we report for the first time the impact that adapting both the code rate as well as the modulation format has on the blocking performance. To do so, we present a new RCMLSA algorithm and evaluate it in terms of blocking by means of simulation. We compared the performance of our RCMLSA algorithm to that of RMLSA and RCSA algorithms. Results obtained for the NSFNet topology show that our RCMLSA algorithm performs better than the RCSA and RMLSA proposals, with a decrease in blocking of more than one order of magnitude (for traffic loads lower than 0.7) with respect to the RCSA.","2161-2064","978-1-5090-1467-5","10.1109/ICTON.2016.7550388","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7550388","elastic optical networks;RSA algorithms;routing modulation level and spectrum allocation algorithms;routing code rate modulation level and spectrum allocation algorithms;FEC codes","Modulation;Bit rate;Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Encoding;Integrated optics;Routing","codes;network routing;optical fibre communication;optical modulation","NSFNet topology;RCMLSA algorithm;elastic optical networks;spectrum assignment algorithm;routing modulation level;routing code","","4","","8","","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The subjects had their maximal metabolic equivalents (MET) estimated and 20 min resting ECG recorded. In RR intervals (iRR) series, a 5 min segment with the least variance was selected. iRR sequence was interpolated at 1 Hz (cubic spline) to estimate the PSD by fast Fourier transform. PCA was applied to PSD, and the first three principal components were retained (90% of the total variability). A logistic regression model based on Mahalanobis distance determined the optimal separation threshold. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the proposed method was compared to standard LF and HF parameters (α=0.05). The proposed method allows to correctly separate all subjects (AUC=1.0), while the HRV parameters in the frequency domain LF and HF provided AUC equal to 0.8 and 0.9 (p>0.05), respectively.

The ideal feedback is the result of a human inspection and analysis considering both functional and qualitative aspects of programs produced by students. On the other hand, automated assessment systems can provide rapid, cheap and standardized feedback. In this paper, we focus on measuring aspects of code that instructors usually assess in programming assignments which are deemed unmeasurable: qualitative aspects that go beyond functional correctness. The aim of this work is to produce richer feedback messages that go beyond functional correctness as it involves code quality issues. We found that if an instructor is required to produce a reference solution for a programming assignment, then most of the expectations the instructor has about a student's code quality are concretely present in the reference solution. Based on this idea, we proposed and evaluated a set of candidate quality measures using the assignment's reference solution as a baseline. The results showed that they seem to capture what is usually considered to be the subjective and qualitative aspects of an instructors' assessment. We used these findings to generate feedback and conducted an experiment to evaluate it effectiveness. The results enforce that this kind of feedback stimulates students to improve their quality code in a higher degree than purely functional feedback, yet it still can be fully automated.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757725","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757725","human factors;experimentation;automated assessment;programming;coding standards;software quality","Manuals;Programming profession;Encoding;Standards;Measurement;Context","computer science education;human factors","student program qualitative aspects;characteristic program-submit-refactor cycle;programming exercises;human inspection;human analysis;automated assessment systems;code measuring aspects;code quality issues;programming assignment;feedback generation","","2","","16","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classically, MTWA is assessed by quantification of beat-by-beat T-wave amplitude alternation. This method requires accurate determination of T-wave peaks (discrete method) to create a sequence of T-wave amplitude series, which undergoes spectral analysis using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for analysis. The need of precise measurements of T-wave amplitudes turns this method sensitive to noise. To overcome this limitation, a new method was developed, based on Hilbert Transform of the T-wave morphology series (continuous method). To perform this task, a 300 ms window containing the T-wave of every beat was isolated, and concatenated to form an artificial and continuous signal with T-waves. The Hilbert Transform was then applied to calculate the envelope of this signal. The alter-nans was detected over the envelope FFT, as a peak on the frequency that corresponded to half of the main signal frequency. Both methods were tested in 50 ECG signals of Physionet T-Wave Alternans Database, 31 synthesized and 19 real world signals. The comparisons of the methods were carried out by linear correlation test, Wilcoxon test, and Bland-Altman charts, in channels 1 and 2. There was no significant differences between both methods in all tests, either synthesized or real world signals. The novel continuous method to quantify micro T-wave alternans based on T-wave morphology is feasible, accurate and reproducible, and have potential clinical application.","2325-887X","978-1-5090-0895-7","","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868675","","Electrocardiography;Databases;Transforms;Morphology;Heart rate variability;Pregnancy;Correlation","bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;fast Fourier transforms;Hilbert transforms;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;statistical analysis","microvolt T-wave alternan analysis;discrete T-wave alternan analysis;continuous T-wave alternan analysis;life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia;beat-by-beat T-wave amplitude alternation quantification;spectral analysis;fast Fourier transform;Hilbert transform;ECG signal detection;linear correlation test;Wilcoxon test;Bland-Altman charts;time 300 ms","","","","6","","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dc bus is considered a market environment where a fictitious energy price is defined according to energy scarcity. The converters that connect the PV generator, loads, and energy storages to the dc bus choose their operation modes in response to the price. The proposed approach was applied to a stand-alone PV system with energy storage. Advantages of the proposed technique are scalability and intuitive programming effort due to the market analogy, so it may be helpful to developers of off-grid PV systems.

One challenge in this configuration is to accurately represent the line behavior. The expressions for the evaluation of impedance and admittance matrices in overhead lines are based on the assumption that the total line length must be at least a few order of magnitude higher that the highest conductor average height. However, in case of a wide line span such hypothesis is not strictly valid and the per-unit of length impedance and admittance must consider the finite length of the circuit. The cascading of short line in time-domain is inefficient, however, if a rational approximation of the equivalent admittance is used a more efficient line model is obtained. A test case based on actual line configuration used to cross the Amazon River is considered and the results indicate that a more accurate frequency domain behavior is obtained leading to a more suitable rational approximation, which is not only more accurate but also is less prone to the residue perturbation in the case of passivity enforcement.","","978-88-941051-2-4","10.1109/PSCC.2016.7540957","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7540957","Transmission lines;rational modeling;network synthesis;Time-Domain","Admittance;Rivers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Matrix converters;Conductors;Impedance;Time-domain analysis","approximation theory;electric admittance;impedance matrix;power overhead lines","rational modeling;overhead transmission lines;finite length impedance expression;finite length admittance expression;impedance matrix evaluation;admittance matrix evaluation;rational approximation;Amazon River;residue perturbation;passivity enforcement","","","","24","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reduce the computational complexity of the offline solution in multiple-output systems, this paper shows how the K q-flat data cluster analysis algorithm can be used to establish a smaller number of polyhedral regions which are able to confine the estimation error in a constraints set. Optimization problems are also formulated in order to significantly reduce the number of regions, but resulting in sub-optimal observers.

In a real implementation, these equipments may present failure and the network quality of transmission may not be fully reliable. Using Network Control System theory, it is possible to design a controller that takes into account the probabilities of failure in sensors, actuators or interruptions in signal communications.

This fact has made the research area of developing efficient approaches to extract spatial and contextual information highly active. Among the existing approaches, morphological profile and attribute profile (AP) have gained great attention due to their ability to classify remote sensing data. This paper proposes a novel approach that makes it possible to precisely extract spatial and contextual information from remote sensing images. The proposed approach is based on extinction filters, which are used here for the first time in the remote sensing community. Then, the approach is carried out on two well-known high-resolution panchromatic data sets captured over Rome, Italy, and Reykjavik, Iceland. In order to prove the capabilities of the proposed approach, the obtained results are compared with the results from one of the strongest approaches in the literature, i.e., APs, using different points of view such as classification accuracies, simplification rate, and complexity analysis. Results indicate that the proposed approach can significantly outperform its alternative in terms of classification accuracies. In addition, based on our implementation, profiles can be generated in a very short processing time. It should be noted that the proposed approach is fully automatic.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2561842","Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship for Postdoctoral Researchers; Helmholtz Young Investigators Group “SiPEO”; FAPESP; CNPq; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514921","Attribute profile (AP);extinction profile (EP);image classification;random forest (RF);remote sensing data","Remote sensing;Data mining;Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Spatial resolution;Earth","remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar","extinction profiles;remote sensing data;attribute profile;morphological profile;contextual information;high-resolution panchromatic data sets;simplification rate;complexity analysis;Reykjavik;Iceland;Rome;Italy","","72","","45","","18 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The extraction and understanding of scales are essential in both analysis and composition of music. However, the scale identification is a nontrivial task. Consequently, classic algorithms for identifying scales have been developed based on the most popular scales, such as major and minor scales. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for identifying musical scales, which allows to detect a wide range of scales beyond the traditional ones. Our method uses a deterministic walk through the nodes of a graph, where each node represents a valid interval structure. The transition between nodes is performed following a validation rule that governs the fragmentation of intervals. Moreover, if the scale is incomplete, possible structures can be determined and the scale is estimated according to the harmonic similarity percentage measure. The proposed method has been tested using a database of Finnish folk melodies and a data set of random melodies composed using rarely used scales. Experimental results show good performance of the proposed technique.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.037","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839578","musical knowledge extraction;graphs;musical scales;codification;deterministic walks","Music;Encoding;Algorithm design and analysis;Harmonic analysis;Databases;Electronic mail;Organizations","graph theory;music","musical scales recognition;deterministic walk;musical scales identification;validation rule;interval fragmentation;harmonic similarity percentage measure;Finnish folk melodies","","","","21","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two main requirements directed the design and development of the system: (i) good usability and (ii) good precision in determining the sentiments expressed about the topic of interest. With the first requirement in mind, the system, developed using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, has a clean interface to enter the keywords that describe the topic of interest and to present the results in several levels of detail. To meet the second requirement, the system uses a Naïve Bayes classifier to identify the sentiments of tweets, as the literature shows that this algorithm combines a good classificatory performance and low response time.

Moreover, this optimized SHE-PWM based GA is applied to a proposed modular seven-level multilevel inverter (7-level MLC2), which is based on the modular five-level MLC2 (5-level MLC2) topology.

Most of DG systems are composed by renewable energy sources, such as Photovoltaic (PV), which has an intermittent behavior, resulting in negative impacts on the distribution network, such as voltage fluctuation. In order to mitigate the voltage rise problem, this paper presents an optimal sizing of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with an efficient charge and discharge strategy, as a way to increase PV penetration, without exceed voltage limits. MATLAB / Simulink is used to simulate a typical Brazilian residential secondary distribution system using actual photovoltaic data and residential load profile from Southeastern Brazil. The results show that the photovoltaic system penetration could reach 40% for a transformer operating at nominal load, without BESS. However, if a BESS is used, the PV penetration could be increased up to 80%. Moreover, it is showed that the BESS can provide an efficient peak shaving in the original load curve.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2016.7785934","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785934","BESS;Distributed Power Generation;Photovoltaic Systems;Power System Simulation","Photovoltaic systems;Mathematical model;MATLAB;IEEE transactions;Distributed power generation","battery storage plants;distributed power generation;optimisation;photovoltaic power systems;power distribution planning;power generation planning","photovoltaic system penetration;battery energy storage system optimal sizing;distributed generation;secondary distribution network;voltage constraints;maximum photovoltaic penetration","","5","","","","16 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among DG technologies, solar photovoltaic (PV) plays a major role due to advances in PV technology, combined with decreasing capital costs and subsidies. The intermittent renewable DG integration may cause impact on distribution power system and several studies have been carried out to analyze grid integration issues associated with PVDG penetration. However, in general, these studies consider penetration scenarios randomly generated or based on technical aspects, regardless economic characteristics of customers. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to assess the impact of DG on distribution system considering customer adoption scenarios.

However, there are a small number of methods that consider both objectives at the same time. In this paper, an algorithm for nonstationary and seasonal time series forecasting, with an evolving neuro-fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (NF-TS) structure, is proposed. For this algorithm, the NF-TS inputs are unobservable patterns extracted from the time series by a decomposition technique. As experiment, a real seasonal time series was used to compare the forecasting performance of these proposed algorithm with an other similar NF-TS, whose inputs were formed by autoregressive data from the same time series. When there is available observations from time series, the NF-TS evolves its structure and adapt its parameters. If the data is not available, the proposed methodology needs to forecast the next value.

Our approach is to automatically create a Domain Dictionary that contains terms with sentiment in the IT context, used to filter terms in ticket for sentiment analysis. We experiment and evaluate three approaches for calculating the polarity of terms in tickets. Our study was developed using 34,895 tickets from five organizations, from which we randomly selected 2,333 tickets to compose a Gold Standard.

RDF datasets has proportionally more problems than relational datasets due to the way data are published, usually without formal criteria. Entity Resolution is n important issue which is related to a known task of many research communities and it aims at finding all representations that refer to the same entity in different datasets. Yet, it is still an open problem. Blocking methods are used to avoid the quadratic complexity of the brute force approach by clustering entities into blocks and limiting the evaluation of entity specifications to entity pairs within blocks. In the last years only a few blocking methods were conceived to deal with RDF data and novel blocking techniques are required for dealing with noisy and heterogeneous data in the Web of Data. In this paper we present a blocking scheme, CER-Blocking, which is based on an inverted index structure and that uses different data evidences from a triple, aiming to maximize its effectiveness. To overcome the problems of data quality or even the very absence thereof, we use two blocking key definitions. This scheme is part of an ER approach which is based on a relational learning algorithm that addresses the problem by statistical approximation. It was empirically evaluated on real and synthetic datasets which are part of consolidated benchmarks found on the literature.","1550-445X","978-1-5090-1858-1","10.1109/AINA.2016.23","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474218","Blocking Scheme;Entity Resolution;Semantic Web;Data Integration","Indexes;Resource description framework;Erbium;Data mining;Semantics;Data models","approximation theory;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;relational databases;semantic Web;statistical analysis","blocking scheme;entity resolution;semantic Web;RDF datasets;relational datasets;research communities;blocking methods;quadratic complexity;brute force approach;entity specifications;Web of Data;CER-blocking;inverted index structure;data quality problems;ER approach;relational learning algorithm;statistical approximation;synthetic datasets","","2","","32","","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our motivation for this research is the possibility of future use of resulting image-space straight lines in several applications. For example, straight lines that represent roof boundary sides and precisely extracted from a high-resolution image can be back-projected onto the ALS-derived building polyhedron for refining the accuracy of its boundary. The proposed method is based on two main steps. First, straight lines that are candidates to represent roof ridgelines and roof boundary sides of a building are extracted from the aerial image. The ALS-derived roof boundary sides and roof ridgelines are projected onto the image space, and bolding boxes are constructed around the projected straight lines while considering the projection errors. This allows the extraction of straight lines within the bounding boxes. Second, a group of straight lines that represent roof boundary sides and roof ridgelines of a selected building is obtained through the optimization of a Markov random field-based energy function using the genetic algorithm optimization method. The formulation of this energy function considers several attributes, such as the proximity of the extracted straight lines to the corresponding projected ALS-derived roof polyhedron and the rectangularity (extracted straight lines that intersect at nearly 90o). In order to validate the proposed method, four experiments were accomplished using high-resolution aerial images, along with interior and exterior orientation parameters, and available ALS-derived building roof polyhedrons. The obtained results have shown that the method works properly and this will be qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated in this research.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2601068","FAPESP (São Paulo State Foundation for Scientific Research); CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil); ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562385","Airborne laser scanner (ALS);Markov random field (MRF);straight line","Buildings;Data mining;Image edge detection;Detectors;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Markov processes","geophysical techniques","Markov-random-field approach;high-resolution aerial images;airborne laser scanner roof polyhedrons;ALS-derived roof boundary sides;Markov random field-based energy function","","2","","36","","7 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the full operation of hydroelectric power plants there is a need to create a huge water reservoir, which transforms the ecosystem and local economy, serving multiple uses, such as tourism, fishing, recreation, sailing, among others. The maintenance in this context is dependent of the quality of water in reservoir, which justifies its continuous monitoring. From the monitored data, it is possible to predict or classify the hydrologic cycle for the reservoir, aiming to support the process of decision about the hydric resources and environmental impact.

The checkbox ON algorithm accomplishes this by delaying the Scheduled Times of Arrivals (STAs) of the airborne flights upstream of the TBFM freeze horizons and compressing these flights to their minimum required spacing, thereby creating a full departure slot. Hence, having the checkbox ON can reduce the frequent ground delays of aircraft departing near high volume airports but can increase delays for airborne arrivals. A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation compared arrival and departure delays to Newark Airport (EWR) with the checkbox ON vs. OFF as the default position. Three other conditions in this HITL involved various National Airspace System (NAS)-wide approaches for timely delivery of aircraft to the TBFM region. These conditions were: Baseline, using current Mile-in-Trail (MIT) spacing restrictions; Integrated Demand Management (IDM), where all aircraft were given departure times (Expect Departure Clearance Times, or EDCTs), ultimately based on the EWR Airport Arrival Rate; and IDM plus Required Time of Arrival (RTA), a flight deck tool which allowed some aircraft to meet a controlled time of arrival to the TBFM area more precisely. Results showed that the checkbox tool was powerful: with the checkbox ON, departure delays decreased and airborne delays increased, as predicted. However, assuming that the cost ratio of a minute of airborne delay to a minute of departure delay is in the range of 1.2 to 3, as commonly indicated by the literature, checkbox ON and checkbox OFF conditions showed approximately equal total delay costs, i.e., the cost of delays in the air balanced the cost of the delay on the ground. The three scheduling conditions also had approximately equal total delay costs, although a simulation artifact may have reduced the delays in the Baseline condition. In the debrief following the simulation, the TMCs concluded that the checkbox should be used flexibly depending on the current delay situation, and suggested modifications to the checkbox tool which would help them use it in this way, along with enhanced training. The relatively similar total cost of both checkbox default options in this simulation indicates that this might be a fruitful approach, and replace the necessity to have the checkbox rigidly set to either ON or OFF.","2155-7209","978-1-5090-2523-7","10.1109/DASC.2016.7778096","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778096","Airborne delay;departure delay;ground delay;Time-Based Flow Management;TBFM Checkbox","Delays;Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Airports;Military aircraft;Aerospace control;Schedules","air traffic control;airports","integrated demand management;expect-departure clearance times;EDCT;EWR airport arrival rate;IDM-plus-required time-of-arrival;RTA;flight deck tool;airborne delays;cost ratio;total delay costs;scheduling conditions;MIT spacing restrictions;mile-in-trail spacing restrictions;NAS;National Airspace System;checkbox OFF algorithm;departure delays;airborne arrival delays;HITL simulation;human-in-the-loop simulation;ground delay reduction;departure slot;flight compression;TBFM freeze horizons;airborne flights;STA delay;scheduled time-of-arrival delay;checkbox-ON algorithm;crowded airborne stream;TMC;traffic management coordinator;TBFM scheduling window;time-based flow management scheduler;airports;departure delay reduction","","","","9","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The uncertainties are caused by various factors, such as departure error due to the difference between scheduled departure and the actual take-off time. A simulation study was conducted using the Multi Aircraft Control System (MACS) software, a comprehensive research platform developed in the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at NASA Ames Research Center. The Crossing Time (CT) performance (i.e. the difference between target crossing time and actual crossing time) of the RTA for uncertainty mitigation during cruise phase was evaluated under the influence of varying two main factors: wind severity (heavy wind vs. mild wind), and wind error (1 hour, 2 hours, and 5 hours wind forecast errors). To examine the CT performance improvement made by the RTA, the comparison to the CT of the aircraft that were not assigned with RTA (Non-RTA) under the influence of the selected factors was also made. The Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) was chosen for this study. A total 66 inbound traffic to the EWR (34 of them were airborne when the simulation was initiated, 32 were pre-departures at that time) was simulated, where the pre-scripted departure error was assigned to each pre-departure (61 % conform to their Expected Departure Clearance Time, which is +/-300 seconds of their scheduled departure time). The results of the study show that the delivery accuracy improvement can be achieved by assigning RTA, regardless of the influence of the selected two factors (the wind severity and the wind information inaccuracy). Across all wind variances, 66.9% (265 out of 396) of the CT performance of the RTA assigned aircraft was within +/- 60 seconds (i.e. target tolerance range) and 88.9% (352 out of 396) aircraft met +/-300 seconds marginal tolerance range, while only 33.6% (133 out of 396) of the Non-RTA assigned aircraft's CT performance achieved the target tolerance range and 75.5% (299 out of 396) stayed within the marginal. Examination of the impact of different error sources - i.e. departure error, wind severity, and wind error - suggest that although large departure errors can significantly impact the CT performance, the impacts of wind severity and errors were modest relative the targeted +/- 60 second conformance range.","2155-7209","978-1-5090-2523-7","10.1109/DASC.2016.7778013","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778013","Required Time of Arrival (RTA);Departure Error;Uncertainty Mitigation;Traffic Flow Management;TFMS;Integrated Demand Management (IDM)","Aircraft;Wind forecasting;Air traffic control;Uncertainty;Airports;Atmospheric modeling","aerospace computing;air traffic control;control engineering computing","required time-of-arrival;uncertainty mitigation;arrival traffic demand management;RTA capability;traffic delivery;traffic demand uncertainty;multiaircraft control system;MACS software;Airspace Operations Laboratory;AOL;NASA Ames Research Center;crossing time performance;CT performance;cruise phase","","","","11","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We derive the method from first principles and consider four particular relationships between background and foreground distributions. One of these assumes an affine relationship with two parameters, and we show how this bivariate parameter space naturally interpolates between the above capabilities. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by comparing it experimentally with published special-purpose solutions for outlier detection and confident classification on 41 benchmark datasets.

LBP texture features were used to represent the spectrogram content, and the classification step was supported by SVM. The spectrogram images were zoned taking to account a perceptual scale, and a specific classifier was created for each zone, which has led us to combine classifiers outputs to get the final decision.

An important class of NoCs evaluation tools are the platforms based on FPGAs, which improve the evaluation time and precision when compared to other solutions. There are different architectures of FPGA-based NoC evaluation tools. Details are scattered among several papers, making a comparative analysis hard to accomplish.

Explicit drift detection methods based on monitoring the time series features may provide a better understanding of how concepts evolve over time than methods based on monitoring the forecasting error of a base predictor. In this paper, we propose an online explicit drift detection method that identifies concept drifts in time series by monitoring time series features, called Feature Extraction for Explicit Concept Drift Detection (FEDD).

In the ICN architecture, the content is the major element and the data name is used for routing the content, instead of the address location as in the Internet nowadays. Furthermore, it is desirable to cache as much data as possible near the user, aiming to improve performance and reduce data transfer. However, data confidentiality can be compromised once it is complex to the content publisher control the access to sensitive data. Although many architectures allow the use of encryption, the key management and the user revocation can be challenging. One possible solution is to insert a proxy to intermediate the access to sensitive data, using a technique named proxy re-encryption (PRE), despite the fact that it inputs an additional overhead to the access.

Nowadays, physicians, nurses and hospital staff need fast and secure access to medical records avoiding bureaucracy for patient information retrieval and imprecision in patient's data maintenance. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing can contribute to overcoming such challenges; however the device impersonation problem should be carefully addressed in this scenario. To deal with such problem, this paper presents a secure architecture based on ubiquitous and pervasive computing for medical records retrieval and maintenance. Such architecture relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) for message exchange between smartphones and tags. An authentication mechanism is presented and validated to ensure device authentication. Analytical results reveal that such mechanism is efficient in providing mutual authentication. Additionally, another important security properties are reached, as confidentiality, message anti-replay and device anti-tracking. Finally, as proof of concept, we present a medication delivery study case based on a developed prototype.","","978-1-5090-2436-0","10.1109/EATIS.2016.7520106","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7520106","Architecture;Security;Electronic Health Records Retrieval;Ubiquitous Computing;Near Field Communication","Authentication;Smart phones;Servers;Hospitals;Computer architecture","authorisation;electronic health records;information retrieval;patient care;smart phones;software architecture;ubiquitous computing","secure architecture;ubiquitous computing;medical records retrieval;electronic health record systems;hospitalizations;medical exams;secure access;patient information retrieval;patient data maintenance;pervasive computing;near field communication;NFC;message exchange;smartphones;authentication mechanism","","1","","15","","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study and use of Software Engineering with its disciplined activities and principles to guide developers of such products to the process used for its development has been growing. For this purpose, the “Cyclic process” was drawn up to develop embedded components [8], a process that seeks to ensure the functioning of product with these characteristics, following an approach of using software engineering processes in its development, using defined procedures identifying and assisting in developing embedded components, thus that errors can be eliminated or minimized through the use of software engineering activities. The “Process Loop”, has been prepared following the guidelines of the CMMI-DEV Level 2 and standards of Space Product Assurance / Software Product Assurance - ECSS-Q-80 and Space Software Engineering - ECSS-E-ST-40 ECSS standard ESA - European Space Agency. In several accidents it is found that most of the causes were problems in embedded components, which led the study and proposal of “Cyclic process” [8]. Due to the particularities of each embedded component and consequent peculiarity of its development, a unique process of development is unable to meet the diversity of needs of different components, so it is necessary that the process meets its features.

This paper proposes a fast transcoder based on an extensive data mining process on H.264/AVC decoding attributes. The data mining allowed identifying relevant information from the H.264/AVC decoding process, which was conveyed to the C4.5 machine learning algorithm to build a set of decision trees that simplify the complex Coding Unit (CU) size decision in HEVC.

Once the control systems are not usually interconnected, steam pressure oscillations may occur in the Coke Plant side or in the Utilities Sector resulting in a large amount of wasted steam through independent relief systems. On a steel plant, steam can be used for some specific equipments or processes. In general, steam is considered a power source, applied on heating and power plants for electricity generation.

In recent years, major advances have been reported in the face recognition and, therefore, the methods are becoming more accurate and efficient. Recent research pointed that feature extraction using activity in directed graphs showed excellent results in feature extraction. In this paper, we proposed a face recognition method based on activities of directed graphs in spatial pyramid. First, the image is represented by a graph, where each pixel is mapped into a vertex and then, the activity of each vertex is estimated. Finally, histograms of activities in spatial pyramid are calculated to characterize the face. According to the results, it was confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method in facial recognition using widely used datasets.","","978-1-5090-4847-2","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900121","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7900121","","Face;Histograms;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Mathematical model;Mouth","computer vision;directed graphs;face recognition;image representation;security of data","directed graphs;spatial pyramid;computer vision;security;feature extraction;face recognition method;graph representation","","","","31","","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity of the problem increases proportionally with the number of agents, due to the fact that all robots must act in cooperation to complete the task. The proposed model employs a combination of different natural swarm behavior techniques to control a team of robots. It was named robot probabilistic cellular automata ant memory (RPCAAM). Our inspiration came from the possibility to mimic the cognitive behaviors of foraging ants with those of pedestrians in a building evacuation. The proposed probabilistic homing can avoid inertial behavior near the nests, which improves team performance. Furthermore, some investigations into robot-robot and robot-obstacles conflicts were improved to make the model more adequate to real-world applications. The probabilistic model was contrasted with deterministic homing. Moreover, the proposed method was implemented in a robotics simulation environment called Webots. Simulation results indicate that foraging tasks could be implemented with low complexity in low-cost architectures.","","978-1-5090-3549-6","10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838615","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838615","Cellular automata;Swarm Robotics;Pedestrian Dynamics;Inverted Ants Pheromone;Tabu Search","Collision avoidance;Probabilistic logic;Biological system modeling;Mathematical model;Automata;Green products","cellular automata;multi-robot systems;probabilistic automata","probabilistic cellular automata ant memory model;foraging robots;multirobot systems;natural swarm behavior techniques;robot team control;robot probabilistic cellular automata ant memory;RPCAAM;cognitive behaviors;foraging ants;pedestrians;building evacuation;probabilistic homing;inertial behavior;robot-robot obstacle conflict;robot-obstacle conflict;robotics simulation environment;Webots","","9","","25","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we develop a study related to the use of recommender systems techniques to aid the volunteers allocation in Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). We evaluated two different clustering algorithms by using two measures for evaluation of clusters. We evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms when they are applied to create different groups of volunteers from Brazilian NGOs by considering the volunteering profile. According to our analysis, the non-supervised learning is promising to build a more complete support decision system to aid the management of NGOs related to volunteers allocation.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.049","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839590","Recommender Systems;Clustering Algorithms;Volunteer Work;NGO Effectiveness;NGO Management","Clustering algorithms;Proposals;Resource management;Organizations;Partitioning algorithms;Recommender systems;Algorithm design and analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;pattern clustering;recommender systems","volunteer allocation;nongovernmental organizations;nonsupervised learning;recommender systems;educational field;e-commerce;tourism;online entertainment;NGO;clustering algorithms","","2","","25","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Damage caused by the spread of rumours is difficult to handle without a full understanding of the dynamics behind it. One of the central steps of understanding rumour spread is to analyze who spread rumours online, why, and how. In this research, we focus on the steps who and why by describing, implementing, and evaluating an approach that studies whether or not a group of users is actively involved in rumour discussions, and assesses rumour-spreading personality types in OSNs. We implement this general approach using Reddit data, and demonstrate its use by determining which users engage with a recurring rumour, and analyzing their comments using qualitative methods. We find that we can reliably classify users into one of three categories: (1) “Generally support a false rumour”, (2) “Generally refute a false rumour”, or (3) “Generally joke about a false rumour”. Combining text mining techniques, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis, we aim to identify and classify those rumour-spreading user categories automatically and provide a more holistic view of rumour spread in OSNs.","","978-1-5090-2846-7","10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752326","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7752326","","Twitter;Text mining;Data visualization;Sentiment analysis;Reliability","data mining;social networking (online);text analysis","social media;online social networks;OSN;rumour discussions;rumour-spreading personality type assessment;Reddit data;qualitative methods;false rumour general support;false rumour general refute;false rumour general joke;text mining techniques;rumour-spreading user categories","","8","","31","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the proposed procedure determines the status of the switching devices in order to effectively isolate a faulty zone and minimize the number of de-energized nodes and zones, while ensuring that the operative and electrical constraints of the system are not violated. The proposed method is comprised of two stages. The first stage solves a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem in order to obtain the binary decision variables for the self-healing scheme (i.e., the switching device status and energized zones). In the second stage, a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem is solved in order to adjust the steady-state operating point of the topology found in the first stage (i.e., correction of the continuous electrical variables and load-shedding optimization). Commercial optimization solvers are used in the first stage to solve the MILP problem and in the second stage to solve the NLP problem.

The adopted methodology was the detection of partial discharges (PD) during a special applied voltage test with the monitoring of temperature and capacitance values. To accomplish this test, a virtual instrumentation system was developed that was cap capable of monitoring the waveforms of the applied voltage and the currents in the capacitor units with simultaneous detection of acoustic PD signals.

Mostly, these problems belong to diversified areas of knowledge, not necessarily related to Computer Science, e.g. in agriculture, specifically in precision agriculture, recognition of diseases in plants, among others. Therefore, it is possible to visualize the multidisciplinary feature that ANNs have, motivating the development of tools for simulating more generic ANN, making its use possible by users whose knowledge of this type of methodology isn't deep. Inside this context, the just described work has had the goal of developing a tool that is part of the BRNeural research project, whose main goal was the development of a simulator named BRNeural (Brasil Neural) which is focused on the scientific and professional community since one of its proposals is to offer a generic environment to aid the creation, train and operate with ANNs. This tool consists in a module for training and testing ANNs with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) topology and it was developed using the ENCOG framework. For validating this module and all implemented training algorithms, the simulator was submitted to pattern recognition tests using agrometeorological data such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed and temperature of leaf wetness, comparing the results obtained with another simulator which was developed using the MLP framework (Medeiros, 2003) with the specific purpose of classifying diseases in severity indexes. After validating, the simulator was submitted to other pattern recognition tests whose goal was the classification of diseases in the wheat like Blight, Spot blotch and Mildew in severity indexes through agrometeorological variables, showing its features such as output normalizations and the training algorithms Backpropagation, Resilient propagation and Quick propagation. The best results were obtained with the tests for the classification of diseases using severity indexes, 83.63% correct answers for Blight using the Quick propagation training algorithm and Equilateral normalization, 86.95% of correct answers for Mildew with Resilient Propagation algorithm and OneOf normalization and, for Spot blotch, 91.96% correct answers with Quick and Resilient Propagation algorithms, both using Equilateral normalization.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2016.7430094","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430094","agriculture;agrometeorological data;Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Neural Networks","RNA;Backpropagation;Artificial neural networks;Diseases;Training;Classification algorithms;Multilayer perceptrons","agriculture;backpropagation;digital simulation;multilayer perceptrons;pattern recognition;plant diseases","artificial neural network simulator;topology multilayer perceptron;precision agriculture;plant diseases;BRNeural research project;Brasil Neural;ENCOG framework;pattern recognition tests;agrometeorological data;wheat diseases;backpropagation;resilient propagation;quick propagation;blight;equilateral normalization;mildew;OneOf normalization;spot blotch","","3","","","","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present simulations and experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2539279","The Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; Brazilian Innovation Agency; The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency; Tractebel Energia under the Tractebel Energia’s Research and Development Program; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431976","optical fiber sensor;distributed temperature sensing;DTS system;DTS spatial resolution;deconvolution;Total Variation;Optical fiber sensor;distributed temperature sensing;DTS system;DTS spatial resolution;deconvolution;total variation","Spatial resolution;Temperature measurement;Temperature;Mathematical model;Deconvolution;Temperature sensors","deconvolution;distributed sensors;fibre optic sensors;Raman spectra;temperature sensors","spatial resolution;Raman DTS;total variation deconvolution;Raman distributed optical sensor;low-pass characteristic;temperature profile;impulse response;deconvolution algorithm","","7","","14","","11 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the presence of a strong LoS path, asymptotic results reveal that the easing-off factor log(SNR) can be eliminated and a faster decay rate, 1/SNR, is achieved.

The main challenge was to investigate the impact on the existing storage system of a new sorting system and, simultaneously, to explore if additional management measures are required to satisfy both throughput levels and overall supply chain requirements. To accomplish a solution for such a complex problem simulation models were developed using ARENA software. Results have shown that the use of simulation allows not only the assessment of the impact of the new sorting equipment but also to test different warehouse management strategies that should be adopted concurrently to ensure that desired throughput levels can be achieved in the new scenario. In fact, this research illustrates the flexibility of the simulation tool to address several complex management issues simultaneously such as the introduction of picking sequencing rules, the use of a class-based storage policy, the addition of new picking stations, and an increase of the number of the available boxes used for transportation.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795554","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795554","","Sorting;Atmospheric modeling;Military aircraft;Analytical models;Supply chains;Throughput","intelligent transportation systems;materials handling;warehouse automation","automated warehouse design validation;discrete simulation;ARENA software;automated sorting system","","2","","14","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such challenge is to determine the most efficient operator or combination of operators to be used during the optimization. In order to deal with this challenge, we propose the use of adaptive operator selection mechanisms in many-objective optimization algorithms. Two adaptive operator selection mechanisms, Adaptive Pursuit (AP) and Probability Matching (PM), are incorporated into the NSGA-III framework (a recently proposed, state-of-the-art algorithm to solve many-objective problems) to autonomously select the most suitable operator while solving a many-objective problem, according to the previous performance of each operator. The proposed algorithms, NSGA-IIIAP and NSGA-IIIPM, are tested in four different multi-objective problems from the DTLZ test suite with 3 up to 20 objectives. Statistical tests were performed to infer the significance of the results. The hypothesis that adaptive ways to select the operator to be applied during each stage of the evolutionary process is an effective way to improve the performance of the NSGA-III framework is corroborated by our results.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.042","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839583","Many-objective optimization;Adaptive Operator Selection;NSGA-III","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Sorting;Mathematical model;Convergence;Probability","genetic algorithms;probability;statistical testing","adaptive operator selection mechanisms;many-objective optimization algorithms;adaptive pursuit;probability matching;NSGA-III framework;NSGA-IIIAP algorithms;NSGA-IIIPM algorithms;statistical tests;evolutionary process","","1","","26","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning from imbalanced data sets poses its own challenges, as common classifiers assume a balanced distribution of examples' classes in the data. Sampling techniques overcome the imbalance in the data by modifying the examples' classes distribution. Unfortunately, selecting a sampling technique together with its parameters is still an open problem. Current solutions include the brute-force approach (try as many techniques as possible), and the random search approach (choose the most appropriate from a random subset of techniques). In this work, we propose a new method to select sampling techniques for imbalanced data sets. It uses Meta-Learning and works by recommending a technique for an imbalanced data set based on solutions to previous problems. Our experimentation compared the proposed method against the brute-force approach, all techniques with their default parameters, and the random search approach. The results of our experimentation show that the proposed method is comparable to the brute-force approach, outperforms the techniques with their default parameters most of the time, and always surpasses the random search approach.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.076","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839617","Meta-learning;Algorithm selection;Sampling algorithms","Prediction algorithms;Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Search methods;Optimization;Gold;Software algorithms","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods;search problems","metalearning method;under-sampling algorithm selection;imbalanced pervasive data sets;medical diagnosis;data balanced distribution;sampling techniques;class distribution;brute-force approach;random search approach","","5","","21","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential applications for using force control can be found in the whole industry and academia. Since its proposal, impedance control became one of the most used force control techniques, dealing with the non linear nature of contact and ensuring stability. To take advantage of the technique, one may implement in different ways, although, in the literature it is hard to find explicit algorithms to help the development. This paper presents two different impedance control methods that lead to similar responses to contact. Responses to force step input and contact stabilization with stiff environment tasks are presented using computer simulations as well as experimental tests. Results show that both algorithms accomplish good results for the second order controller in a no-contact situation compared to the simulation. In the meanwhile, for a stiff contact, the algorithms show a stable interaction, but with results different from the simulated, suggesting that the coupled dynamics is subject to many disturbances and uncertainties, which the impedance controller still offer a stable execution.","","978-1-5090-3656-1","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2016.52","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783538","Impedance control;robotics;contact","Impedance;Mathematical model;Force;Service robots;Sensors;Shock absorbers","force control;industrial robots;mechanical contact;robot dynamics;stability","impedance control;force control;nonlinear contact;stability;force step input;contact stabilization;computer simulations;second order controller;no-contact situation;stiff contact;coupled dynamics;industrial robots","","2","","15","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose two variants of the Nearest Neighbor Minimal Learning Machine (NN-MLM) with reject option. The NN-MLM is an computationally efficient version of the recently proposed supervised learning algorithm called Minimal Learning Machine (MLM). The two variants (rejoNN-MLM and rejoNNwMLM) are evaluated on real world datasets and compared to state-of-the-art classifiers with reject option. Result show that both methods are a valid alternative for problems that require a reject option.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.078","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839619","Minimal Learning Machine;Classification with Reject Option;Binary Classification","Training;Reliability;Estimation;Optimization;Supervised learning;Standards;Design methodology","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","reject option;classification algorithms;nearest neighbor minimal learning machine;NN-MLM;supervised learning algorithm;rejoNN-MLM;rejoNNwMLM","","1","","17","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing plan recognition approaches are seldom tested at their limits, and, though they use conceptually similar plan library representations, they rarely use the exact same domain in order to directly compare their performance, leading to the need for a principled approach to evaluating them. Thus, we develop a mechanism to automatically generate arbitrarily complex plan libraries which can be directed through a number of parameters, in order to create plan libraries representing different domains and so allowing systematic experimentation and comparison among the several plan recognition algorithms.

In this paper we fill this void by proposing an analysis of the role of the aforementioned strategies on an extensive set of bi-objective functions. We focus on the class of algorithms that use Gaussian univariate marginal models, and study how typical selection and replacement strategies used together with this probabilistic model impact the behavior of the search. Our analysis is particularized for a set of bi-objective functions that exhibit a representative set of characteristics (e.g. decomposable, ill-conditioned, non-linear, etc.).

To answer these and other questions, we analyzed the memory allocation and deallocation traces from different real applications under their typical workloads, and found consistent allocation patterns. For instance, we observed that small allocations were predominant (in average 85%) in all applications analyzed, as well as short duration allocations that corresponded to 85.06% of all allocated memory.

Though, many times the use of Machine Learning is not enough to make sense of all this data. This makes visualization a very useful tool for Machine Learning practitioners and data analysts alike. Interactive visualization techniques can be very helpful by giving insight on the meaning of the output from classification tasks. This also applies to the data itself, as visualization can make some characteristics of the data become clear. Several bi-dimensional projection methods have been used to visualize data instances based on their attribute values. This visualization is more difficult when the instances have a large number of attributes. One of the visualization techniques that can deal with high dimensional data is Radial Coordinates Visualization (RadViz). RadViz can also be employed to visualize the performance of a probabilistic classifier, helping a user to find problematic instances that might have been misclassified. In this study, a new approach to use RadViz is proposed and investigated. The proposed approach combines the two aforementioned uses of RadViz (attribute-based data exploration and result exploration based on the output of probabilistic classification). For such, it approach provides an easy transition between the two types of visualization. This allows the context to be preserved, since the user can visually track the same data instance from one type of visualization to the other. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a prototype, named DualRadviz, was implemented. On this prototype, in addition to RadViz, visualization by Parallel Coordinates is also provided, so that precise instance inspection can be performed, since, different from RadViz, Parallel coordinates visualization does not suffer from ambiguity. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, a case study is presented.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.052","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839593","RadViz;information visualization;probabilistic classification;machine learning;parallel coordinates","Data visualization;Prototypes;Probabilistic logic;Context;Inspection;Springs;Matrix converters","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","DualRadviz;classification evaluation;machine learning;interactive visualization;bidimensional projection methods;data instance visualization;radial coordinates visualization;probabilistic classifier;attribute-based data exploration;parallel coordinates visualization","","1","","13","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If code smells are not systematically removed from a program, its continuous degradation may lead to either major maintenance effort or the complete redesign of the system. For several reasons, software developers introduce smells in their code as soon as they start to learn programming. If novice developers are ought to become either proficient programmers or skilled code reviewers, they should be early prepared to effectively identify code smells in existing programs. However, effective identification of code smells is often not a non-trivial task in particular to a novice developer working in isolation. Thus, the use of collaborative practices may have the potential to support developers in improving their effectiveness on this task at their early stages of their careers. These practices offer the opportunity for two or more developers analyzing the source code together and collaboratively reason about potential smells prevailing on it. Pair Programming (PP) and Coding Dojo Randori (CDR) are two increasingly adopted practices for improving the effectiveness of developers with limited or no knowledge in software engineering tasks, including code review tasks. However, there is no broad understanding about the impact of these collaborative practices on the effectiveness of code smell identification. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving 28 novice developers, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of collaborative practices in the identification of code smells. We compared PP and CDR with solo programming in order to better distinguish their impact on the effective identification of code smells. Our study is also the first in the literature to observe how novice developers work individually and together to identify smells. Our results suggest that collaborative practices contribute to the effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. Our findings can also be used in practice to guide educators, researchers or teams on improving detection and training on code smell identification.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.18","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789840","Code Smells;Collaborative Practices;Controlled Experiment;Program Comprehension;Software Degradation","Collaboration;Software;Programming profession;Encoding;Degradation;Software engineering","software maintenance;software quality;software reviews;source code (software)","code smell identification;software quality degradation;software maintenance;source code;pair programming;Coding Dojo Randori;CDR;PP;software engineering tasks;code review tasks;solo programming","","8","","23","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present an algorithm to solve deterministic cooperative MOO-MDPs, and prove that it learns optimal policies while reducing the learning space by exploiting state abstractions.

Clearly, the concept is the same whether it is multiple processors on a board or a chip multiprocessor with several cores on a chip. With the advent of HMPs, thread scheduling becomes much more challenging, while having to deal with thread to processor-type mapping. In particular, it is important that the operating system is able to understand the workload behavior when a thread is to be migrated to a core of a different type. In this paper, we describe a thread characterization method that explores machine learning techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of predicting thread execution across different processor types. We use hardware performance counters and use machine learning to predict performance when moving a thread to another core type on heterogeneous processors. We show that our characterization scheme achieves higher structural similarity (SSIM) values when predicting performance indicators, such as instructions per cycle and last-level cache misses, commonly used to determine the mapping of threads to processor types at runtime. We also show that support vector regression achieves higher SSIM values when compared to linear regression, and has very low (1%) overhead.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.017","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828285","","Radiation detectors;Instruction sets;Hardware;Predictive models;Data models;Benchmark testing","cache storage;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling;regression analysis;support vector machines","thread profile prediction;core types;machine learning techniques;heterogeneous multiprocessors;energy consumption;computer systems;HMP;workload processing;chip multiprocessor;thread scheduling;thread-to-processor-type mapping;operating system;workload behavior;thread characterization method;thread execution prediction;structural similarity values;SSIM values;instructions-per-cycle;last-level cache misses;support vector regression","","2","","27","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, combining different clustering algorithms (cluster ensembles) is one of the most used approaches, in an attempt to overcome the limitations of each clustering technique. The main aim is to combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution (consensus partition). To date, several approaches have been proposed in literature in order to provide optimization, or continuously improve the solutions found by the cluster ensembles. Therefore, as a contribution to this important subject, this paper presents a new bio-inspired optimization technique to optimize the cluster ensembles. In this proposed technique, the cluster ensembles are heterogeneously created and the initial partitions are combined through a method which uses the Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm, resulting in a consensus partition. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique, an empirical analysis will be conducted using 15 different problems and applying two different indexes in order to examine its efficiency and feasibility.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.054","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839595","Cluster ensembles;bio-Inspired optimization techniques;Objective Functions","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms;Context;Robustness","optimisation;pattern clustering","bio-inspired optimization technique;cluster ensembles optimization;clustering algorithms;coral reefs optimization algorithm;consensus partition","","1","","14","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When not properly addressed, those problems can hinder the longevity of a software system. Studies have revealed that a range of architectural problems are reflected in source code through two or more code smells. However, a software project often contains thousands of code smells and many of them have no relation to architectural problems. Thus, developers may feel discouraged to identify architectural problems if they are not equiped with means to focus their attention in a reduced set of locations in their system to start with. However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short in assisting developers in the prioritization of code smells that are likely to indicate architectural problems in a program. As a consequence, developers struggle to effectively focus on (groups of) smells that are architecturally relevant, i.e., smells that contribute to a critical design problem. This work presents and evaluates a suite of criteria for prioritizing groups of code smells as indicators of architectural problems in evolving systems. These criteria are supported by a tool called JSpIRIT. We have assessed the prioritization criteria in the context of more than 23 versions of 4 systems, analyzing their effectiveness for spoting locations of architectural problems in the source code. The results provide evidence that one of the proposed criteria helped to correctly prioritize more than 80 (locations of) architectural problems, alleviating tedious manual inspections of the source code vis-a-vis with the architecture. This prioritization criteria would have helped developers to discard at least 500 code smells having no relation to architectural problems in the analyzed systems.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.11","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789838","Code smells;Architectural problems;Agglomerations;Software evolution","Computer architecture;Software;Electronic mail;Fats;Documentation;History;Iron","software architecture;source code (software)","architectural problem identification;code smell prioritization;software projects;software system;source code;critical design problem;JSpIRIT tool","","9","","25","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The significant rise in the number of publications in the last few years shows how much importance and concern academia gives to the subject. However, previous studies have pointed out that when it comes to software architecture concepts and practices, there is a gap between industry and academy. Industry professionals do not know/use what is proposed by academic researchers. From the academic perspective, the theoretical foundations about software architecture, architectural documentation and architectural conformance checking are well developed. Then why industry seems not to follow them? What aspects does the academy miss about the problems in practice? What is the practical/industrial context about software architecture's definition, documentation and verification? Aiming to answer these questions, we performed a 3-step qualitative study. Firstly, we applied an exploratory survey to 58 professionals to better understand the state of the practice on software development and architecture and to give us an initial comprehension of software architecture concepts, practices and problems from the point of view of the industry. Secondly, we interviewed 14 top-professionals chosen among those who participated in the exploratory survey. In this phase we intended to deeply understand the professionals' perceptions on the subject. We used thematic analysis to assess the narratives, to form a base for our understanding and to formulate our comprehension as a series of statements. Finally, in a third phase, we performed a confirmatory survey by means of which we were able to confirm the findings. We sent the survey to GitHub users with public emails and more than 100 followers, getting 7.74% of response rate (337 respondents). From our study, we confirmed that there is not a single and unified definition and understanding of the term ""software architecture"" among software developers. In particular, we observed that the definition depends on several factors, such as the professional's experience and the company in which he/she is currently working. The architecture is sometimes documented but, most of the time, it is incomplete, informal and outdated. Finaly, we observed that while there is a general perception of the relevance of architectural conformity and compliance of software, activities to check architectural conformance and compliance are seldom adopted - not to mention the use of automated tools and procedures.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.14","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789842","Software Architecture;Survey Architecture;Conformance Checking;Industry","Software;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Electronic mail;Industries;Documentation;Visualization","program verification;software architecture;system documentation","software architecture documentation;software architecture conformance checking;software architecture definition;software verification;software development;thematic analysis;GitHub;software compliance","","","","23","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such preferences come from elements that are present or can be more easily obtained in the context of practical multi-agent programming platforms, such as multiple sources from which the information (used to construct the arguments) was acquired, as well as varying degrees of trust on them. Further, we introduce different agent profiles by varying the way certain operators are applied over the various information sources leading to the preferences over competing arguments in our approach. Unlike previous approaches, our approach accounts for multiple sources for a single piece of information and is based on an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism implemented on a multi-agent platform so arguably more computationally grounded than those approaches.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.017","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839558","Argumentation;Trust;Agent-oriented programming language","Cognition;Multi-agent systems;Context;Birds;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Programming","multi-agent systems;object-oriented programming;planning (artificial intelligence);software agents","information sources;argumentation-based reasoning;agent reasoning;argumentation techniques;multiagent platforms;multiagent programming platforms","","4","","24","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many applications, the data labeling process is expensive and can affect the predictive performance of classification models. A current solution has been the use of active learning, which investigates strategies for data labeling. Its main goal is to decide which instances should be labeled and added to the training set, reducing the overall labeling costs. However, the strategy normally depends on a learning algorithm, which should be chosen by a machine learning specialist - usually based on a cross-validation procedure. Consequently, there is a deadlock: without the complete training set, the algorithm that will present the best learning curve cannot be known in advance. Ideally, some type of automatic selection should be employed to solve this deadlock. This study investigates the use of meta-learning for automatic algorithm selection in active learning tasks. Experimental results show that meta-learning is able to find correspondences between algorithms and dataset features in order to help active learning to reduce the risks of incurring in unexpected labeling costs.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.021","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839562","machine learning;active learning;meta-learning;recommendation","Prediction algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Clustering algorithms;Labeling;System recovery;Entropy","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods","learning bias automatic selection;active sampling;machine learning;data labeling process;classification models;active learning;metalearning;automatic algorithm selection","","","","44","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also demonstrate that the Java JIT effectiveness may vary according to the benchmark (1.16 and 23.97 times in performance and 1.19 to 19.85 times in energy consumption compared to the VM without JIT); and when it reaches good optimization levels, it can be up to 23% faster, consuming 42% less energy, and having an EDP 58% lower than C++.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.019","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828287","Programming paradigms;performance and energy evaluation;multithreaded applications","Java;C++ languages;Benchmark testing;Programming;Energy consumption;Virtual machining;Computer architecture","C++ language;energy consumption;multi-threading;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming;power aware computing;program compilers;programming languages;software performance evaluation;virtual machines","Java JIT;energy savings;JIT compiler;just-in-time compiler;VM;virtual machines;Java;C++;object-oriented programming languages;NAS parallel benchmark;EDP;energy-delay product;energy consumption;multithreaded applications;programming paradigms;programming languages","","3","","37","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Behind each interface there is a series of software and hardware operations with different shapes according to the availability of implementations, hardware accelerators, or processor cores, and the environmental conditions faced by the embedded system such as the power consumption or even the chip's temperature. For example, when running out of battery, a mobile device can decide to reconfigure the implementation of critical components for one that consumes less energy by delivering a functionality with a lower quality-of-service without depleting the battery. To cope with such adaptive systems without breaking the interface each component provide to the application, we propose a framework for mutant components whose implementation can be reconfigured during runtime. The system synthesis delivers a tailored wrapper for each component according to the number of implementations it has. We evaluate our proposal by profiling the execution time of methods from three components (AES, ADPCM, and DTMF) with a hardware and a software implementation to evaluate the overhead incurred to the resulting architecture regarding its the execution time.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.023","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828291","System-level design;HW/SW co-design;High-level synthesis","Hardware;Runtime;Embedded systems;Substrates;IP networks","embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;user interfaces","mutant components;embedded system;programming language;hardware accelerators;processor cores;mobile device;quality-of-service;system synthesis;AES;ADPCM;DTMF;hardware-software codesign","","","","23","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers consult them whenever they need to know already reported problems or have to investigate previous bug solutions. This activity, however, consumes a substantial amount of time once bug reports content might achieve dozens of comments and thousands of sentences. One recommended and massively applied solution to prevent developers to read the entire bug report is to summarize the whole conversation in a few sentences. Summaries ideally give to developers an overview of the current status of the bug and the reasons, highlighting the result of each proposed solution, for which environments, which solutions are most appropriated, and the necessary information to reproduce the bug. This strategy intends to minimize the time a developer would spend in maintenance tasks. However, investigations demonstrate that summaries do not meet the expectations of developers and, in practice, they still read the entry line of discussion. To circumvent this drawback, we propose a summary based on comments, instead of the ones based on isolated sentences, as proposed by previous works. We argue that a ranking of the most relevant comments would enable developers to find more appropriate information. Empirical results corroborate with our arguments and show that summaries generated by traditional ranking algorithms are accurate with respect to developers expected information when compared to reference summaries created manually.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.17","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789844","text summarization;bug;bug reports;ranking;bug reports summarization","Computer bugs;Software;Euclidean distance;Computer architecture;Electronic mail;Face;Context","management of change;program debugging;software maintenance","bug report summarization;ranking techniques;software artifacts;change management tasks;maintenance tasks","","4","","20","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the CA-based task scheduling domain, a partial answer is given by recent works that investigate two approaches named μ and ρ to evolve CA rules through a standard genetic algorithm, avoiding an undesirable dynamical behavior denoted by long-cycle and chaotic rules. Both approaches have been shown able to find CA rules with adequate dynamical behavior. However, each one presented its particularities: μ was stronger to avoid long-cycle rules and ρ obtains more refined rules (fixed-point behavior). In the present work, we investigate a new mixed approach named μρ in which the good characteristics of μ and ρ are preserved.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.094","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839635","Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithm;Scheduling Problem","Lattices;Program processors;Dynamic scheduling;Schedules;Processor scheduling;Computer architecture;Genetic algorithms","cellular automata;scheduling;task analysis","cellular automata rules;task scheduling;discrete dynamical systems;chaotic dynamics","","4","","19","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Topic modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, were designed for this purpose. However, discovering high quality topics in short text collections is a challenging task. This is because most topic modeling methods rely on information coming from the word co-occurrence distribution in the collection to extract topics. As in short text this information is scarce, topic modeling methods have difficulties in this scenario, and different strategies to tackle this problem have been proposed in the literature. In this direction, this paper introduces a method for topic modeling of short texts that creates pseudo-documents representations from the original documents. The method is simple, effective, and considers word co-occurrence to expand documents, which can be given as input to any topic modeling algorithm. Experiments were run in four datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods for extracting topics from short text. Results of coherence, NPMI and clustering metrics showed to be statistically significantly better than the baselines in the majority of cases.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.058","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839599","Topic modeling;short text;text expansion","Twitter;Measurement;Vocabulary;Tagging;Resource management;Context;Probabilistic logic","data structures;Internet;pattern clustering;social networking (online);statistics;text analysis","topic modeling;short texts;cooccurrence frequency-based expansion;World Wide Web;social media;status messages;latent Dirichlet allocation;pseudo-documents representations;NPMI;clustering metrics;statistics","","2","","15","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, its performance depends on different aspects of design (e.g., inertia factor, velocity equation, topology). The task of deciding which is the best algorithm design to solve a particular problem is challenging due to the great number of possible variations and parameters to take into account. This work proposes a novel context-free grammar for Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) algorithms to guide the construction of Particle Swarm Optimizers. The proposed grammar addresses four aspects of the PSO algorithm that may strongly influence on its convergence: swarm initialization, neighborhood topology, velocity update equation and mutation operator. To evaluate this approach, a GGGP algorithm was set with the proposed grammar and applied to optimize the PSO algorithm in 32 unconstrained continuous optimization problems. In the experiments, we compared the designs generated considering the proposed grammar with the designs produced by other grammars proposed in the literature to automate PSO designs. The results obtained by the proposed grammar were better than the counterparts. Besides, we also compared the generated algorithms to state-of-art algorithms. The results have shown that the algorithms produced from the grammar achieved competitive results.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.061","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839602","Particle Swarm Optimization;Genetic Programming;Algorithm Generation","Grammar;Algorithm design and analysis;Topology;Optimization;Mathematical model;Convergence;Standards","context-free grammars;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation","context-free grammar;particle swarm optimization algorithms;grammar-guided genetic programming algorithms;GGGP algorithms;PSO algorithm;swarm initialization;neighborhood topology;velocity update equation;mutation operator;unconstrained continuous optimization problems","","1","","20","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many heuristic strategies for MAPPs were proposed in the literature using different techniques. In the k-range strategies, autonomous agents communicate indirectly by reading and writing information in the surrounding nodes that are located up to k edges away from the agent. From these, the 0-range strategies (where agents can only sense its current node) are especially suitable for the design of robust autonomous robots with simple hardware. In this work, we propose a new method to convert 1-range strategies (the most common case) into 0-range strategies.

However, the power wall is still a barrier to improving the processor design process due to the power consumption of components. Hard real-time systems are part of life critical environments and reducing the energy consumption on such systems is an onerous and complex process. This paper assesses the problem of finding optimum allocations and frequency assignments of hard real-time tasks among heterogeneous processors targeting low power consumption but taking into account timing constraints. We also propose models based on a well-established formulation in the operational research literature of the Multilevel Generalized Assignment Problem (MGAP). We tackle the problem from the perspective of different integer programming mathematical formulations and their interplay on the search for optimal solutions for RM and EDF. Computational experiments show that providing upper bounds determined by a meta-heuristic based on genetic algorithm reduces the time to finding optimal solution from hours to milliseconds, enabling us to still pursue optimum in larger instances.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.027","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828295","Hard Real-time;MGAP;Schedulability;DVFS","Program processors;Real-time systems;Energy consumption;Power demand;Genetic algorithms;Resource management;Linear programming","frequency allocation;genetic algorithms;integer programming;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;power consumption;real-time systems","low power hard real-time task allocation;multiple heterogeneous processors problem;heterogeneous multicore platforms;hard real-time systems;potential reduced energy consumption;processor design process;power consumption;optimum allocations;frequency assignments;timing constraints;multilevel generalized assignment problem;MGAP;integer programming mathematical formulations;genetic algorithm","","1","","27","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A commonly reported issue about the existing AORE approaches is the lack of appropriate resources (guidelines, processes, catalogs, among others) to support software engineers during the concern identification and classification. This work aims to mitigate this issue by proposing: (i) a reference ontology for the software concerns domain, called O4C (Ontology for Concerns), and (ii) an ontologically-based approach for AORE, called ObasCId (Ontologically-based Concern Identification and Classification), that suggests the usage of catalogs of software concerns and a well-defined process for supporting software engineers to perform these activities in a more systematic way. An experimental study was performed on ObasCId and its results indicated that this approach may positively contribute for the concern identification and classification effectiveness without harming its execution time.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.10","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789848","Crosscutting Concerns;Early-Aspects;AspectOriented Requirements Engineering;Concern Identification and Classification","Software;Ontologies;Requirements engineering;Guidelines;Systematics;Context;Security","aspect-oriented programming;formal specification;formal verification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software engineering;systems analysis","ObasCId;ontologically-based approach for concern identification and classification;aspect-oriented requirements engineering;software concern identification;software development cycle;AORE approach;reference ontology;O4C","","","","33","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technology is termed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and combines the classic field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the representational power of modern Deep Learning approaches. DRL enables solutions for difficult and high dimensional tasks, such as Atari game playing, for which previously proposed RL methods were inadequate. However, these new solution approaches still take a long time to learn how to actuate in such domains and so far are mainly researched for single task scenarios. The ability to generalize gathered knowledge and transfer it to another task has been researched for classical RL, but remains an open problem for the DRL domain. Consequently, in this article we evaluate under which conditions the application of Transfer Learning (TL) to the DRL domain improves the learning of a new task. Our results indicate that TL can greatly accelerate DRL when transferring knowledge from similar tasks, and that the similarity between tasks plays a key role in the success or failure of knowledge transfer.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.027","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839568","Reinforcement Learning;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning","Learning (artificial intelligence);Games;Space exploration;Approximation algorithms;Training;Knowledge transfer;Artificial neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge transfer;deep reinforcement learning;artificial intelligence research;building intelligent agents;representational power;modern deep learning;Atari game playing;classical RL;DRL domain;transfer learning;TL","","8","","27","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The final multiclass prediction is obtained by a proper combination of the outputs of the binary classifiers induced in their solution. Decision directed acyclic graphs (DDAG) can be used to organize and to aggregate the outputs of the pairwise classifiers from the one-versus-one (OVO) decomposition. Nonetheless, there are various possible DDAG structures for problems with many classes. In this paper evolutionary algorithms are employed to heuristically find the positions of the OVO binary classifiers in a DDAG. The objective is to place easier sub-problems at higher levels of the DDAG hierarchical structure, in order to minimize the occurrence of cumulative errors. For estimating the complexity of the binary sub-problems, we employ two indexes which measure the separability of the classes. The proposed approach presented sound results in a set of experiments on benchmark datasets, although random DDAGs also performed quite well.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.031","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839572","Machine learning;Genetic Algorithms;Multiclass Problem","Genetic algorithms;Complexity theory;Indexes;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics;Support vector machines","computational complexity;directed graphs;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","decision directed acyclic graphs;multiclass classification problems;machine learning;multiple binary subproblems;DDAG;one-versus-one decomposition;OVO;evolutionary algorithms;binary subproblem complexity","","2","","28","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the lack of low-cost solutions or negligence, roadways pavement quality inspections are usually set aside or hardly performed at some places. This fact leads to higher casualties rates, driving discomfort, vehicle damage, and money prejudice. A cheap and accurate way to solve this problem is the use of typical smartphones with accelerometers and GPS sensors to measure the impact inflicted on the car when driving over a poor quality road surface. This scrutiny helps to raise data that can be used by road maintenance staff. Most current systems tend to translate its output to an international standard called IRI (International Roughness Index) but, this practice demands high computer processing. Here is presented ""RoadScan"", a crowdsourcing Android application that determines pavements quality in a simple and lightweight way.

The first process enables the recognition of physical structures such as stairs, elevators and corridors, based on images obtained from an on-board camera. The second process identifies the proximity to obstacles (based on the information from an on-board laser sensor) in order to determine the direction and moving speed of the robot for navigating an indoor space.

In this aspect, the High Level Architecture (HLA) establishes specific policies for data exchanging and time management of communication in the integration of the simulation components. Thus, this paper aims to explain and analyse the feasibility to integrate devices based on heterogeneous architectures using distributed and parallel computing, multi-core CPU and GPU, with OpenCL technology. For that, the use of the IEEE 1516 standard, called High Level Architecture, is proposed targeting this integration and allowing the use of all computing power from available devices in a distributed system.

Together, transcription and translation are known as gene expression. Transcriptograms are basically defined as ""images"" of gene expression data of genomes, by generating expression profiles for transcriptomes. They allow to assess cell metabolism, being capable of discriminating the stage the cell is going through at a given instant, as well as pointing metabolic changes in altered cellular states as compared to a control state, independently of the transcriptome profilling protocol. Though, they cannot highlight differential expression profiles. We present a new possibility of RNA-Seq data analysis using Transcriptograms for discovering module-based differential expression profiles.

Software layers implementing this API can be built over existing libraries, allowing embedded software to access cryptographic functions in a consistent way that does not depend on the underlying library. The API complies to good practices for API design and good practices for embedded software development and took its inspiration from other cryptographic libraries and standards. The main inspiration for creating GEmSysC was the CMSIS-RTOS standard, which defines an unified API for embedded software in a implementation-independent way, but targets operating systems instead of cryptographic functions. GEmSysC is made of a generic core and attachable modules, one for each cryptographic algorithm. Until now, three modules were been fully specified: AES, RSA, and SHA-256. As a proof of concept, two implementations of GEmSysC were made. One of them was built over wolfSSL, which is an open source library for embedded systems. The other was built over OpenSSL, which is open source and a de facto standard. Unlike wolfSSL, OpenSSL does not specifically target embedded systems. This paper displays test results showing GEmSysC to be simpler than other libraries in some aspects. These results have shown that both implementations incur in little overhead in computation time compared to the cryptographic libraries themselves. The overhead of the implementation has been measured for each cryptographic algorithm and is between around 0% and 0.17% for the implementation over wolfSSL and between 0.03% and 1.40% for the one over OpenSSL. This document also presents the memory costs for each implementation.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.034","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828302","API;cryptography;embedded systems;open standard;open source","Cryptography;Libraries;Engines;Embedded systems;Data structures;Standards","application program interfaces;cryptography;embedded systems","cryptographic API;GEmSysC;unified cryptographic API;embedded systems;CMSIS-RTOS standard;AES;RSA;SHA-256;open source library","","","","36","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples of natural language processing (NLP) tasks studied via topological analysis of networks are keyword identification, automatic extractive summarization and authorship attribution. Even though a myriad of network measurements have been applied to study the authorship attribution problem, the use of motifs for text analysis has been restricted to a few works. The goal of this paper is to apply the concept of motifs, recurrent interconnection patterns, in the authorship attribution task. The absolute frequencies of all thirteen directed motifs with three nodes were extracted from the co-occurrence networks and used as classification features. The effectiveness of these features was verified with four machine learning methods. The results show that motifs are able to distinguish the writing style of different authors. In our best scenario, 57.5% of the books were correctly classified. The chance baseline for this problem is 12.5%. In addition, we have found that function words play an important role in these recurrent patterns. Taken together, our findings suggest that motifs should be further explored in other related linguistic tasks.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.071","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839612","Natural language processing;complex networks;authorship attribution;network motifs","Writing;Complex networks;Syntactics;Topology;Text analysis;Feature extraction","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","authorship attribution;network motifs identification;complex networks;text analysis;natural language processing;NLP tasks;keyword identification;automatic extractive summarization;recurrent interconnection patterns;pattern classification;feature extraction;machine learning methods","","7","","42","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is detrimental to the autonomy and the reactivity of the agent under unknown or changing scenarios. Ego-centric localization has been less explored, and the works considering on-board acquisitions have mostly dealt with tasks under controlled scenarios where the path to the object is cleared from obstacles. In this work a behavior-based control scheme is proposed, so the robot Nao can approach and position in relation to a given face of an object, while avoiding obstacles. For this, the solution relies on top-down (color-based) and bottom-up (optic-flow-based) visual features, and proprioceptive information registered on-board. The model is decentralized and exploits the emergent aspect of behavior from the independent contribution of a walk and a look-at task. An embodied visual encoding approach is proposed to support the arbitration between competing behavioral modes.","","978-1-5090-3656-1","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783497","Behavior Architecture;Visual Attention;Ego-localization;Humanoid Robot;Visual Servoing","Robot sensing systems;Visualization;Encoding;Legged locomotion;Image segmentation","collision avoidance;feature extraction;humanoid robots;image colour analysis;image sensors;image sequences;mobile robots;robot vision","top-down-bottom-up visual attention model;humanoid object approaching;obstacle avoidance;humanoid walk tasks;sensors;ego-centric localization;on-board acquisitions;behavior-based control;robot Nao;optic-flow-based visual features;color-based visual features;proprioceptive information;visual encoding","","1","","16","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, this new proposal is applied in the Fuzzy Reasoning Method (FRM) of Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems (FRBCSs). Finally, we compare the results provided by our new approach against the best solution proposed by Lucca et al. (that uses an fixed value for the variable alpha ).

Machine learning algorithms are useful tools to perform this task, but usually it is necessary to reduce complexity of data using feature selection algorithms. As usual, many algorithms were proposed to reduce dimension of data, each one with its own advantages and drawbacks. The variety of algorithms leads to either choose one algorithm or to combine several methods. The last option usually brings better performance. Based on this, this paper proposes an analysis of two distinct approaches of combining feature selection algorithms (decision and data fusion). This analysis was made in supervised classification context using real and synthetic datasets.

This paper proposes an unsupervised concept-based approach for single-document summarization using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Such an approach maximizes the coverage of the important concepts in the summary, avoiding redundancy, and taking into consideration some readability aspects of the generated summary as well. A new weighting method that combines both coverage and position of the sentences is proposed to estimate the importance of a concept. Moreover, a weighted distribution strategy that prioritizes sentences at the beginning of the document if they have relevant concepts is investigated. The readability of the generated summaries is improved by the inclusion of constraints into the ILP model to avoid dangling coreferences and breaks in the normal discourse flow of the document. Experimental results on the DUC 2001-2002 and the CNN corpora demonstrated that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art summarizers evaluated regarding the traditional ROUGE scores.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.079","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839620","Automatic Text Summarization;Single-document summarization;Concept-based approach;Integer Linear Programming","Mathematical model;Coherence;Optimization;Integer linear programming;Computational modeling;Natural language processing;Analytical models","document handling;integer programming;linear programming;unsupervised learning","concept-based integer linear programming;automatic single-document summarization;unsupervised concept-based approach;weighted distribution strategy;document sentences;document flow","","1","","20","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, in this work, we propose a new method to compute these maps based on salient points extracted through local descriptors. After, a nonparametric kernel density estimation method is employed to estimate the final saliency map. In order to assess the performance, we carry out experiments on two large benchmark databases to demonstrate the proposed method performance against the state-of-the-art methods using different scoring metrics.

In a distributed multi-agent setting, this would constrain the autonomy of the agents, and violate their privacy. Thus, by using task allocation protocols, the agents themselves can compete to decide who will take each goal, then later plan individually provided coordination mechanisms are in place, giving a higher degree of autonomy and privacy during the planning process. In this paper, we propose the use of a contract net protocol mechanism to allocate social goals in multi-agent planning. Our contributions are an algorithm for determining a bid, and several bid evaluation criteria. We also define some heuristics that can be used as bids. In our algorithm, agents expand social goals using their plan library in order to collect information and formulate their bid.

This is because it is able to improve the teleoperator's view with less bandwidth consumption than traditional teleoperation architectures. In this paper a new approach for teleoperating a manipulator is presented. The virtual representation of the manipulator is made by using encoder sensors, and also, a camera image is displayed through an Android interface to complement the teleoperator's view.

However, in the past couple of years the machine learning community has seen the rise of deep learning methods that significantly improve the accuracy of several computer vision applications, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this paper, we explore the suitability of ConvNets for the movie trailers genre classification problem. Assigning genres to movies is particularly challenging because genre is an immaterial feature that is not physically present in a movie frame, so off-the-shelf image detection models cannot be directly applied to this context. Hence, we propose a novel classification method that encapsulates multiple distinct ConvNets to perform genre classification, namely CoNNECT, where each ConvNet learns features that capture distinct aspects from the movie frames. We compare our novel approach with the current state-of-the-art techniques for movie classification, which make use of well-known image descriptors and low-level handcrafted features. Results show that CoNNECT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in this task, moving towards effectively solving the genre classification problem.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.012","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839553","Movie Genre Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning;Computer Vision;Video Classification","Motion pictures;Feature extraction;Videos;Image color analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Sensitivity;Computer vision","computer vision;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;video signal processing","deep learning;videos;machine learning approaches;computer vision;ConvNets;convolutional neural networks;movie trailers genre classification problem;immaterial feature;off-the-shelf image detection models;CoNNECT;image descriptors;low-level handcrafted features","","8","","27","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper presents a system that allows a parallel approach for optimizing keyframe movements for the Robocup 3D Soccer Simulation League. Moreover, optimization results obtained using this system are shown to validate it.","","978-1-5090-3656-1","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2016.20","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783506","","Interpolation;Cost function;Humanoid robots;Servers;Three-dimensional displays","digital simulation;mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;path planning;robot dynamics;robot kinematics","keyframe movement optimization;simulated humanoid robot;parallel optimization;motion control;mobile robotics;walking motions;reduced order mathematical models;ZMP approach;dynamic motions;Robocup 3D Soccer Simulation League","","1","","10","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, predicting failures in HDDs became a topic that attracted much attention in recent years. Monitoring a HDD status can provide information about its degradation, so as to let the user or a system manager know about a failure before it happens, preventing loss of information. In this paper, we propose a failure prediction method using a Bayesian Network. Our method uses the deterioration over time of a HDD, calculated via SMART (SelfMonitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) attributes, for predicting eventual failures. To demonstrate practical usefulness, this method was applied to a dataset consisting of 49,056 hard drives from Backblaze's data centers. The proposed method has improved the mean and median quadratic errors in 28.3% and 17.6% respectively in comparison with a baseline model.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.083","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839624","hdd failure prediction;hard disk drives;bayesian networks","Bayes methods;Predictive models;Data models;Estimation;Fault detection;Random variables;Smoothing methods","belief networks;disc drives;hard discs;system monitoring;system recovery","Bayesian network based failure prediction approach;hard disk drives;BaNHFaP;HDD;SMART;self-monitoring analysis and reporting technology;Backblaze data centers;median quadratic errors;mean errors","","7","","26","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even if a virtual machine is allocated with adequate CPU resources, the quality of service of those running both CPU and I/O intensive tasks (heterogeneous workload), may be seriously affected if they are not provided in a timely manner. As server consolidation grows, CPU sharing among multiple virtual machines leads to negative impact on I/O intensive tasks running within the guest OS, due to incurred scheduling latency and lack of prioritization by hypervisor's scheduler. Although a fair amount of researches have dedicated to improve I/O performance on a multi-core platform through the implementation of coexisting schedulers, heterogeneous workloads still lacks of in-depth exploration. In this paper, we systematically evaluate scheduler's interference on I/O responsiveness of heterogeneous workloads domains under server consolidation. The performance study aims to create a synthetic heterogeneous workload based on media streaming applications by varying packet sizes. Furthermore, we apply the coexisting schedulers approach in order to analyze the linearity of quality of service metrics such as throughput, jitter and packet loss over this specific scenario.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.014","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828282","I/O virtualization;coexisting schedulers;performance study","Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Streaming media;Quality of service;Servers;Scheduling;Hardware","multiprocessing systems;virtual machines","quality of service metrics;media streaming;heterogeneous workloads;multicore platform;multiple virtual machines;CPU;workload profile clustering;virtual machines;network I/O performance","","","","19","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we restrict the search space for partnerships to the social neighborhoods of agents so that the social capital is used to reach a near-optimal solution by identifying how reputation can be used to better adapt the network, with the objective of bringing together agents who are more likely to cooperate in successful coalitions. In addition, our model allows a more precise quantifying of the relevance of the agents over time in social coalition formation. Experiments with different initial network topologies show that our approach is significantly better than static networks or structure-based adaptations whenever the initial network does not fit a high degree of interconnectedness, such as in a small-world model. In all the cases, the results are statistically better than current adaptation strategies.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.047","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839588","Coalition Formation;Reputation;Social Network","Adaptation models;Social network services;Network topology;Collaborative work;Topology;Games;Computational modeling","game theory;multi-agent systems;network theory (graphs);search problems;social sciences","reputation-based agent impact evaluation;social coalition formation;dynamic model;decentralized model;coalitional skill games;CSG approach;reward analysis;optimal coalition structure;total reward maximization;search space;social capital;near-optimal solution;agent relevance;network topologies","","","","17","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of its transductive setting is to label all unlabeled data at once. In this paper, we developed a technique to grade positive-class pertinence levels of each sample, and we interpret the grades to classify the unlabeled ones. In our method, a sparse binary matrix represents the input data, which determines the feature-sample network whose vertices represent samples and attributes. The limiting probabilities of a random walk in the network estimate the pertinence levels. The results are evaluated regarding both class discrimination and classification accuracy. Computer simulations reveal that our model performs well in positive-unlabeled learning, especially with few labeled samples. Notably, the outcomes compare to the results from supervised methods, which profit from most data labeled. Additionally, the technique has linear time and space complexity if the input dataset is already in a sparse representation. The low computational cost of the construction and update of the feature-sample network allows for extensions of the technique to several learning problems, including online learning and dimensionality reduction.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.051","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839592","Semi-supervised classification;complex networks;positive-unlabeled learning;random walk","Iris;Markov processes;Limiting;Sparse matrices;Computational modeling;Complex networks;Computers","computational complexity;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;random processes;sparse matrices","random walk;feature-sample networks;semisupervised classification;positive-class pertinence levels;sparse binary matrix;probabilities;class discrimination;classification accuracy;computer simulations;positive-unlabeled learning;linear time complexity;space complexity;sparse representation;dimensionality reduction;online learning","","2","","14","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many situations, it is desirable to provide some assurance that we can safely change a SPL in the sense that the behaviour of existing products is preserved. Developers can rely on previously proposed safe evolution notions, by means of transformation templates to ensure safe evolution. However, the existing templates were only applied in scenarios where a product line expands, and have not been evaluated in the context of extracting features from existing code. Therefore, we conducted a study using an industrial system developed in Java with 400 KLOC. This study revealed the need for new templates to address feature extraction scenarios, as well as improving the existing templates notation to address more expressive mappings between features and code assets. As a result of this study, we successfully extracted a product line from this existing system using the proposed templates, and also found evidence that the new templates can help to prevent defects during product line evolution.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.21","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789835","Software Product Lines;Product Line Evolution;Safe Evolution;Refinement","Software;Feature extraction;Manuals;Frequency modulation;Computer architecture;Java;Software product lines","feature extraction;Java;software product lines","software product line safe evolution;feature extraction;product quality;product line maintenance;SPL;transformation templates;industrial system;Java;KLOC;code assets","","2","","17","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle that, we propose JustModeling, an MDE approach formed by JBModel, a graphical modeling tool with which the user models the application business classes using the UML class diagram and that provides a set of model transformations to generate code for the JustBusiness framework, which automatically generates all necessary resources of the mobile application.

Among such techniques, we can note the DCL language (Dependency Constraint Language), which is a domain-specific language that has interesting results in architectural conformance contexts. However, the current version of DCL has some limitations, such as lack of modularity and low degree of reuse, which may prevent its adoption in real software development scenarios.

Some approaches aim at detecting and fixing code anomalies, but they miss a deeper discussion about the introduction patterns and life cycle of such code anomalies. In this paper we analyze several projects to understand the incidence of code anomalies and their life cycle.

Nonetheless, the PSO performance depends on the fine tuning of different parameters. To make the algorithm design process more independent from human intervention, some researchers have treated this task as an optimization problem. Grammar-guided Genetic Programming algorithms (GGGP), in special, have been widely studied and applied in the context of algorithm optimization. GGGP algorithms produce customized designs based on a set of production rules defined in the grammar, differently from methods that simply select designs in a pre-defined limited search space. In this work, we proposed a tree-based GGGP technique for the generation of PSO algorithms. This paper intends to investigate whether this approach can improve the production of PSO algorithms when compared to other GGGP techniques already used to solve the current problem. In the experiments, a comparison between the tree-based and the commonly used linearized GGGP approach for the generation of PSO algorithms was performed. The results showed that the tree-based GGGP produced better algorithms than the counterparts. We also compared the algorithms generated by the tree-based technique to state-of-art optimization algorithms, and the results showed that the algorithms produced by the tree-based GGGP achieved competitive results.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.016","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839557","Particle Swarm Optimization;Genetic Programming;Algorithm Generation","Algorithm design and analysis;Grammar;Optimization;Search problems;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Standards","genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;trees (mathematics)","tree-based grammar genetic programming;particle swarm optimization;PSO;human intervention;grammar-guided genetic programming algorithms;GGGP","","2","","16","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An efficient strategy is the adoption of an ensemble of classifiers to divide the classification problem. In ensembles with classifier selection, there is no fusion of the classifiers decisions. A particular classifier is selected according to the input data instead. In this paper, well-known clustering methods based on self-organizing structures are used to implement ensembles with classifier selection. The self-organizing structures are used to detect the topological structure of data and help to divide the problem into smaller and easier sub-problems to solve. Experiments with different datasets show that the use of clustering methods to perform the classifier selection can contribute to split the problem and improve the classification accuracy compared to some traditional strategies. Additionally, the results encourage the development of more research to find out other ways to split problems using data clustering techniques.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.087","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839628","Ensemble of classifiers;Self-Organizing Maps;Artificial Neural Networks","Training;Next generation networking;Clustering methods;Self-organizing feature maps;Testing;MATLAB","pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","classifier selection;self-organizing maps;supervised classification methods;data topological structure;data clustering techniques","","","","35","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitors are essential in AS, being responsible for collecting and processing data from environment. There exist different kinds of monitors with distinct characteristics. Based on a literature review, we have noticed that Monitors are usually designed and implemented in an inadequate way: i) making them obscure in the source-code, ii) compelling all of them to have the same polling rate and also iii) predetermining the execution order among them. This leads to maintenance, evolution and performance problems. Besides, based on our observations, this erroneous way monitors are implemented follows a pattern and it is a recurrent practice. Therefore, we believe it can be classified as Monitor Smells of Adaptive Systems. In this paper we present two architectural smells we have identified: the Obscure Monitor and the Oppressed Monitors. The first smell occurs when the monitors are not evident in the source-code. The second smell occurs when monitors are compelled to have the same poling rate and an immutable execution order at runtime. The presence of these smells compromises the reusability, evolvability and maintainability. We have also conducted an exploratory study by comparing the impact of maintenance tasks in the original version of an AS called PhoneAdapter with a refactored version, in which the smells were removed. The results indicate the maintenance is facilitated in the version without the smells.","","978-1-5090-5086-4","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.19","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789839","Adaptive System;Architectural Smells;Monitoring","Monitoring;Sensors;Global Positioning System;Bluetooth;Adaptive systems;Maintenance engineering;Broadcasting","software maintenance;software reusability;source code (software)","data processing;data collection;source-code;polling rate;monitor smells of adaptive system characterization;architectural smells;obscure monitor;oppressed monitors;software reusability;software evolvability;software maintenance;PhoneAdapter","","2","","25","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basically, truck factor (aka bus factor) designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. Although being a key measure of the concentration of information among team members, we still have few algorithms proposed to estimate truck factors. More importantly, we lack rigorous comparisons of the existing algorithms. Therefore, in this paper we provide a comparative study of the two main algorithms proposed in the literature to estimate truck factors.

Moreover, they have the advantage of producing comprehensible models and satisfactory accuracy levels in several application domains. Like most of the Machine Leaning methods, these algorithms have some hyper-parameters whose values directly affect the performance of the induced models. Due to the high number of possibilities for these hyper-parameter values, several studies use optimization techniques to find a good set of solutions in order to produce classifiers with good predictive performance. This study investigates how sensitive decision trees are to a hyper-parameter optimization process. Four different tuning techniques were explored to adjust J48 Decision Tree algorithm hyper-parameters.

A pattern database (PDB) stores solutions to an abstract version of a state space problem. An admissible lower bound for a given state is obtained by decomposing it into abstract states and combining their pre-computed solutions.

In many routing algorithms, sensor nodes forward data in a multicast fashion and a specific routing metric defines which of the receiving nodes is the next forwarder. If this metric is static, optimal routes tend to be overused and nodes in that route die quickly. The Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP) is a cross-layer protocol designed to deliver authenticated, encrypted, timed, and georeferenced messages containing SI-compliant data in a resource-efficient way. It defines a novel, data-centric paradigm for programming WSNs and the IoT. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate dynamic routing in TSTP, which can explore routing metrics naturally given by the protocol's cross-layer, geo-oriented design, such as distance to the destination and message TTL (Time-to-Live). We introduce the idea of spatial distortion to map virtually any metric into a time-to-transmit offset, and evaluate the impact of different combinations of metrics. We assess the spatial distortion metrics on a TSTP implementation over IEEE 802.15.4 on the OMNET++ simulator, comparing their impact on the network in terms of end-to-end delay, fairness index, and delivery ratio.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.024","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828292","Wireless Sensor Networks;Geographic Routing;Cross-Layer Protocol","Measurement;Distortion;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Routing protocols;Cryptography","cryptography;message authentication;multicast communication;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","dynamic routing metrics;geographic protocol;message routing;wireless sensor networks;routing algorithms;sensor nodes;multicast routing;receiving nodes;optimal routes;trustful space-time protocol;cross-layer protocol;authenticated messages;encrypted messages;timed messages;georeferenced messages;SI-compliant data;WSN programming;IoT;dynamic routing evaluation;geo-oriented design;spatial distortion;time-to-transmit offset;spatial distortion metrics;TSTP implementation;IEEE 802.15.4 networks;OMNET++ simulator;end-to-end delay;fairness index;delivery ratio","","4","","12","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most remodularization approaches are heavyweight and lack tool support. This paper, therefore, proposes a lightweight and tool supported remodularization process based on structural similarity. The process is centered on the observation that the remodularization of a software system can be achieved by successive applications of Move Class, Move Method, and Extract Method refactorings. We evaluate the process in a modified version of an open-source software achieving a recall of 100% and a precision of 50%.

This paper presents a comparison between the following two kind of approaches to terrain coverage applied to an abstract model of generation and propagation of random events: the geometric ones, very commonly applied in autonomous offline designed missions, and real-time search approaches, original proposed to be used by mobile robots in terrestrial online navigation, which never was, to the best of our knowledge, experimented in this kind of application. For this comparison, simulations with one, three and five UAVs were conducted. We evaluated all approaches according the total number of detected events (NE), the response time to detect each event, the time interval between visits, and the number of visits in each location. The circular movements approach presented the best result in the total number of detected events. All approaches are equivalent regarding the response time. The interval between visits of achieved by each approach is strongly related to the number of vehicles and there is no outstanding approach.

This approach exploits the observation that certain functions are executed several times with the same inputs, producing the same output. Therefore, by saving its results once in a reuse table, it is possible to skip subsequent calls when the same set of inputs is found. However, the table tends to get very large, and functions with multiple input arguments make the fetching process extremely costly because all input values must be compared to the saved ones. In this work, we combine function reuse with approximation, exploiting the characteristic that some applications are naturally error-tolerant, to quickly access the table using a single key and reduce its size. By using two image-processing benchmarks from the AxBench suite, we show that traditional function reuse achieves a reuse rate close to 0% due to the diversity of inputs. However, by applying approximation, it is possible to trade quality for reuse rate and achieve almost 50% reuse rate with less than 6% quality degradation.","2324-7894","978-1-5090-2653-1","10.1109/SBESC.2016.026","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828294","reuse;approximate computing;performance","Context;Hardware;Approximate computing;Parallel processing;Software;Transforms;Acceleration","approximation theory;image processing","image-processing applications;approximate function reuse;single-threaded applications;instruction-level parallelism;reuse table;AxBench suite","","","","14","","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Techniques for exception detection and handling are not an optional add-on but a fundamental part of such apps. Yet, no study has investigated the main characteristics of the EH code of mobile apps nor the developers perspective about the good and bad practices of EH in such context. This paper reports two complementary studies: one that inspected the EH code of 15 popular Android apps (which overall comprises of 3490 try-catch-finally blocks); and other study which surveyed 47 Android experts to get their opinion about the good and bad practices of EH development in Android environment.

In order to overcome this problem, many methods have been proposed in the literature. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has become a very popular research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence areas due to its characteristics such as fast training procedure, good generalization and universal approximation capability. Although ELM has been successfully applied in different domains, its basic formulation cannot handle datasets with missing values properly. This paper presents a variant of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for datasets with missing values. In the proposed method, probability distributions for the missing values are estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, assuming that data is normally distributed. The Unscented Transform (UT) is used to estimate the values of the hidden layer outputs, and the weights of the output layer are assigned using the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse. Numerical experiments are carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in four real world and two synthetic regression datasets. The results show that the proposed method presented a good performance in terms of Average Root-Mean-Squared Error (ARMSE).","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.026","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839567","Extreme Learning Machines;Unscented Transform;Missing Values","Transforms;Random variables;Training;Covariance matrices;Computational modeling;Neurons;Two dimensional displays","approximation theory;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;regression analysis;statistical distributions;transforms","extreme learning machines;ELM;unscented transform;UT;missing data;data analysis;machine learning;artificial intelligence;training procedure;generalization;universal approximation capability;probability distributions;expectation maximization algorithm;EM algorithm;distributed data;Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse;synthetic regression datasets;average root-mean-squared error;ARMSE","","1","","24","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However it is also possible to face a multiclass problem with an ad hoc approach, i.e., a classifier able to handle all classes at once. In this work a method able to handle several classes is proposed. This new method is based on the Voronoi diagram. We try to dynamically divide the feature space into several regions, each one assigned to a different class. It is expected for the method to be able to construct a complex classification model. However, as it is in its beginning, some tests need to be performed in order to evaluate its feasibility.

The main idea is based on the clustering of the pixels in order to mitigate the multicollinearity issue and a new feature is extracted for each cluster of similar pixels. This allows to define feature extraction techniques by setting just three parts: (1) defining pixel vectors in the training set, each pixel vector is a representative for a pixel on every training image, (2) a clustering algorithm for the pixels vectors, (3) finally it is performed a linear combination of the pixel into a cluster, in order to create a single feature per cluster. The framework also makes it possible to create simpler, computationally cheaper and more general new implementations of well known feature extraction methods such as Waveletfaces. Two extraction methods are implemented and tested in three face datasets. Test results are compared to the traditional Eigenfaces and others state-of-art feature extraction methods for face recognition.

The small spaces between joints is a critical design constrain for including actuators during the design tasks, and therefore transmission mechanisms are often implemented on these robots. In this paper the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) bioinspired algorithms have been applied to a transmission mechanism of a robotic finger. In this case the goal is to achieve a previously modeled finger movement in order to make possible gripping tasks. Two cost functions have been explored, the first one for evaluating the fingertip trajectory and the second one for evaluating the joint's angles work. Tatistical results and test hypothesis are used for comparing the achieved results with the Genetic Algorithm (GA). For this approach the results show that the DE algorithm for both cost functions are not statistically different. Finally, it's proposed the use of the mean of the results of the DE implementations for the two cost functions, providing a better result than the separate ones.","","978-1-5090-3656-1","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2016.40","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783526","Robotic hand;swarm intelligence;particle swarm optimization;differential evolution","Robots;Trajectory;Bars;Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Genetic algorithms","actuators;genetic algorithms;manipulators;particle swarm optimisation","bioinspired optimization;robotic finger mechanism;biomimetic multifingered manipulators;robotic hands;actuators;design tasks;transmission mechanisms;particle swarm optimization;differential evolution;linger movement;gripping tasks;cost functions;lingertip trajectory;genetic algorithm;GA;DE algorithm;PSO algorithm","","","","12","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-determinism introduced by cache, multi-core and operating systems, for example, makes timing analysis highly complex or even impossible. We address this problem by presenting a RISC-V Instruction Set Simulation platform equipped with a task profiling mechanism for cache aware execution time measurements. The generated SystemC processor simulation model is integrated within a high abstraction level simulation platform with main memory and cache.

In an optimization context, symbiotic relationships can be used to perform information exchange between populations of candidate solutions to a given problem. This paper presents an information exchange model inspired by symbiotic relationships and applies the model to unconstrained single-objective continuous optimization problems. The symbiotic relationships are modelled using the Pareto dominance criteria inside a computational ecosystem for optimization. The Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is used to compound the populations of the ecosystem. Four models of relationships are analyzed: slavery, competition, altruism and mutualism. Thirty unconstrained single-objective continuous benchmark functions with high number of dimensions (d = 200) are tested and obtained results compared. Results suggest that the proposed model for information exchange favors the balance between exploration and exploitation leading to better results.","","978-1-5090-3566-3","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.066","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839607","Symbiotic Relationships;Continuous Optimization;Bio-inspired algorithm;Computational Ecosystem;Biological Plausibility;Natural Computing","Sociology;Statistics;Symbiosis;Optimization;Biological system modeling;Topology;Computational modeling","Pareto optimisation","Pareto-based symbiotic relationships model;information exchange model;unconstrained single-objective continuous optimization problems;Pareto dominance criteria;artificial bee colony algorithm;exploration;exploitation","","","","15","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, generalized mutual subspace method (gMSM) has attracted attention for image-set matching due to its advantages in accuracy and robustness. However, gMSM employs PCA, which has high computational cost contrasting to state-of-art appearance-based methods. To create a faster method, we replace the traditional PCA by 2D-PCA and variants on gMSM framework. In general, 2D-PCA and variants require less memory resource than conventional PCA since its covariance matrix is calculated directly from two-dimensional matrices. The introduced method has the advantage of representing the subspaces in a more compact manner, providing reasonably competitive recognition rate comparing to the traditional MSM, confirming the suitability of employing 2D-PCA and variants on gMSM framework.

In order to accomplish this, an initial path is geometrically defined and an optimization is done over this path, using genetic algorithm. Basically, our path planning method uses the distance ranges available (longitudinal and lateral) for the maneuvering and the sailboat desired heading to generate points in-between, which are reachable given the wind restriction. The proposed method uses these path planning parameters to come up with an optimized path.

But inferring a full network is sometimes non-trivial if the raw data is in the form of many small patches or subgraphs, of the true network, and if there are ambiguities in the identities of nodes or edges in these patches. This may happen because of noise or because of the nature of data; for instance, in social networks, names are typically not unique. Graph assembly refers to the problem of reconstructing a graph from these many, possibly noisy, partial observations. Prior work suggests that graph assembly is essentially impossible in regimes of interest when the true graph is Erdös-Rényi. The purpose of the present paper is to show that a modest amount of clustering is sufficient to assemble even very large graphs. We introduce the G(n, p; q) random graph model, which is the random closure over all open triangles of a G(n, p) Erdos-Renyi, and show that this model exhibits higher clustering than an equivalent Erdos-Renyi. We focus on an extreme case of graph assembly: the patches are small (1-hop egonets) and are unlabeled. We show that in realistic regimes, graph assembly is fundamentally feasible, because we can identify, for every edge e, a subgraph induced by its neighbors that is unique and present in every patch containing e. Using this result, we build a practical algorithm that uses canonical labeling to reconstruct the original graph from noiseless patches. We also provide an achievability result for noisy patches, which are obtained by edge-sampling the original egonets.","","978-1-5090-4550-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2016.7852327","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7852327","","Social network services;Generators;Mathematical model;Labeling;Data mining;Noise measurement;Computer network reliability","graph theory;social networking (online)","network assembly;ambiguous patches;graph mining;network analysis problems;small subgraphs;true network;social networks;graph assembly;graph reconstruction;Erdos-Renyi graph;random graph model;canonical labeling;noiseless patches;noisy patches;edge-sampling;original egonets","","","","18","","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These analyses recover high-level array length information that is missing from C's type system. We emit annotations in the style of GObject-Introspection, which produces bindings from annotations on function signatures. We annotate each array argument as terminated by a special sentinel value, fixed-length, or of length determined by another argument. These properties help produce more idiomatic, efficient bindings.

Little however has been done to characterize/profile online users' behaviors as football supporters and use them as an aggregate measure to club characterization. Today, the availability of data enable us to understand at a much greater scale if rivalries exist and if there are signatures that can be used to characterize supporting behavior. In this paper we use techniques from Data Science to characterize football supporters according to their activity on Twitter and to characterize clubs according to the behavior of their supporters. We show that it is possible to: (i) rank football clubs by their popularity and fans' dislike, (ii) identify the rivalries that exist between clubs and their supporters, and (iii) find specific signatures that repeat themselves across different clubs and in different countries.

Data were collected within the Heart Caravan Initiative (Paraíba, Brasil). Patients were divided into two study groups: Group 1 evaluated by a third year medical student (User 1), and an experienced nurse (User 2); Group 2 evaluated by User 2 and an Information Technology professional (User 3). Patients were auscultated sequentially by the two users, according to the randomization. Features extracted from each data set included the length (HR) of the audio files, the number of repetitions per auscultation area, heart rate, first (S1) and second (S2) heart sound amplitudes, S2/S1, and aortic (A2) and pulmonary (P2) components of the second heart sound and relative amplitudes (P2/A2). Features extracted were compared between users using paired-sample test Wilcoxon test, and Spearman correlations (P<;0.05 considered significant). Twenty-seven patients were included in the study (13 Group 1, and 14 Group 2). No statistical significant differences were found between groups, except in the time of auscultation (User 2 consistently presented longer auscultation time).

We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian PUC-PR.

High-frequency isolation is ensured by using three single-phase transformers connected in open delta-wye configuration. The variation of both phase-shift angles between the H-bridge legs and/or primary and secondary sides allows controlling the power flow, while reduced reactive power flow is possible. The variable duty cycle is used to ensure a constant voltage bus and/or zero voltage switching operation. A detailed analysis is presented considering a model based on the fundamental components for the voltages and currents in the transformer.

The paper addresses circuit design for effective interface between the high power inverter system and the embedded microcontroller as well as how to utilize built-in interrupts to achieve efficient digital control implementation, with user specified sampling time, and generation of high-quality pulse-width modulated driving pulses. Moreover, an embedded software design was developed to implement the neural network vector control for the single-phase inverter.

In this framework, independent component analysis (ICA) was recently proposed as an alternative method to eigenvector decomposition to better interpret non-Gaussian heterogeneous clutter (inherent to high-resolution synthetic aperture radar systems). Until now, the two main drawbacks reported of the aforementioned method are the greater number of samples required for an unbiased estimation, when compared to the classical eigenvector decomposition, and the inability to be employed in scenarios under the Gaussian clutter assumption. In this paper, both drawbacks are analyzed. First, a Monte Carlo approach is performed in order to investigate the bias in estimating Touzi's target-scattering-vector-model parameters when ICA is employed. Simulated data and a RAMSES X-band image acquired over Brétigny, France, are taken into consideration to investigate the bias estimation under different scenarios.

For measurements to be reproducible, the same methods must be available across different laboratories. In this paper, we present a tool that allows users to perform quantitative analyses over the web, thus providing an efficient environment not only for individual cases to be evaluated, but also for users to share a common ground when making measurements. The classification method used by the tool to segment stained pixels is performed by a similarity function based on the polynomial version of the Mahalanobis distance, which is nonlinear and provides very robust classification for m-dimensional feature spaces. Furthermore, the similarity function can be generalized in the tool, so that images can be classified by reusing parameters of previous cases.

Generally, the texture is assumed polarization independent, which causes PolSAR data to present a spherical symmetry property, allowing for the usage of most of the algorithms present in the literature. Nevertheless, the existence of polarization-dependent clutter has also been reported, for which specific algorithms need to be derived. Therefore, it becomes clear that the first step in SAR data analysis should be the validation of the model employed. Within this context, this paper presents a new methodological framework to assess the conformity of multivariate high-resolution SAR data with respect to the product model in terms of asymptotic statistics. More precisely, spherical symmetry is investigated by applying statistical hypothesis testing on the structure of the quadricovariance matrix. Simulated data, data from the P-band airborne data set acquired by the Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) over the French Guiana in 2009 in the frame of the European Space Agency campaign TropiSAR and a RAMSES X-band image acquired over Brétigny, France, are taken into consideration to investigate the performance of the derived test.

Even though CCN design includes a set of security mechanisms in order to to ensure authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of contents, some security threats still exists. One of these threats is content pollution, where malicious users cause legitimate users to retrieve incorrect contents, what, in the worst scenario, can lead to a denial of service attack. To mitigate this problem it was proposed CCNCheck, a mechanism that makes all routers in the network to check the signature of contents according to the same probability, which makes the mechanism's efficiency very topology-dependent. In this paper we propose two different deployment approaches to CCNCheck. The first one splits the network routers into two groups: border router and core routers. These two groups were associated with two different verification probabilities. In the second approach, we let the verification probability in the border routers to vary dynamically, according to the pollution level perceived by the router. We have shown through simulation experiments that these approaches reduce topology dependency, allow users to retrieve the majority of requested contents and reduces the number of polluted messages forwarded in the network core.","","978-1-5090-4671-3","10.1109/NOF.2016.7810123","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7810123","","Pollution;Network topology;Proposals;Computer crime;Topology;Internet","computer network security;data integrity;digital signatures;information retrieval;Internet;probability","content pollution mitigation;content-centric networking;Internet;CCN design;security mechanisms;content confidentiality;content integrity;content authenticity;security threats;malicious users;denial of service attack;CCNCheck;topology-dependent mechanism efficiency;network routers;border router;core routers;verification probability","","3","","10","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on analyzing this type of denial of service (DoS) attack. It proposes an analytical model that helps to understand the conditions that make the architecture more or less susceptible to this threat. Evaluation shows that the model is useful to analyze the circumstances in which the PIT is more vulnerable to flooding attack.

In this context, software quality is important in order to prevent risks for the patient. Studies show that many LISs have a low quality degree, and although the ISO/IEC 25010 standard defines software quality in general, so far there is no specific customization for a quality evaluation model tailored for such systems. This paper presents a case study applying a customized evaluation model - the AdEQUATE model - in order to evaluate the software quality of a LIS widely used in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil - the LACEN system - from the perspective of its end users. Analyzing the characteristics of the LACEN system, we customized the AdEQUATE model - a model for quality evaluation of telemedicine systems based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard through the use of a questionnaire. The questionnaire has been answered by 69 users (including physicians and biochemists), and its answers were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In general, the quality of the LACEN system has been considered as good, specifically for characteristics like effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom from risk, functional suitability, and security. On the other hand, few characteristics have been considered of low quality, including performance efficiency and compatibility. Also, the collected data shows that it is feasible to use AdEQUATE's systematically derived questionnaire for detailed observations of quality degrees of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard characteristics and subcharacteristics.","2372-9198","978-1-4673-9036-1","10.1109/CBMS.2016.51","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545961","software quality evaluation;laboratory information systems;case study","Telemedicine;Software quality;IEC Standards;ISO Standards;Information systems;Medical services","IEC standards;ISO standards;medical information systems;quality control;software performance evaluation;software quality;telemedicine","software quality evaluation;laboratory information system;Santa Catarina State integrated telemedicine and telehealth system;LIS;information management;patients information;examination information;quality control;ISO/IEC 25010 standard;quality evaluation model;customized evaluation model;AdEQUATE model;Brazil;LACEN system","","4","","34","","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonlinear expressions such as thermal generation costs and hydro production are usually represented by convex piecewise linear approximations. Even though dynamic piecewise linear (DPWL) models - which evolve as the problem is being solved - are advantageous as compared to static PWL models (which are computed a priori), its applicability to SDDP-based approaches is hampered by the fact that it is not possible to build a model for all nodes that may be visited during its iterative procedure. As a consequence, we lose the advantage of such DPWL models, which is to approximate the nonlinear expressions only around the regions of optimal operation, which are scenario-dependent. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new state-dependent dynamic piecewise linear model for thermal generation costs, where we build a DPWL for each system state, which are defined as the combination of system energy storage level at a given time step and the inflow scenario of the SDDP solving strategy. We assess the performance of this model for small / medium scale hydrothermal problems.","1944-9933","978-1-5090-4168-8","10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741799","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741799","Generation planning;stochastic programming;piecewise linear models;Benders decomposition","Stochastic processes;Computational modeling;Energy storage;Reservoirs;Cost function;Upper bound;Dynamic programming","dynamic programming;energy storage;hydrothermal power systems;iterative methods;piecewise linear techniques;power generation planning;stochastic processes;stochastic programming;thermal power stations","thermal generation costs;hydrothermal coordination;stochastic nonlinear optimization problems;stochastic dual dynamic programming;SDDP;nonlinear expressions;hydroproduction;convex piecewise linear approximations;dynamic piecewise linear models;DPWL models;iterative procedure;state-dependent dynamic piecewise linear model;system energy storage","","","","22","","14 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In turn, AD is a set of techniques based on the mechanical application of the chain rule to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. The AD method has a fundamental role in this work since it calculates the exact values of the derivatives of a function for a given set of input values while numerical differentiation methods introduce unacceptable round-off errors in the discretization process. With this purpose, and using the Matlab programming environment, we developed several algorithms (namely GPAD) and addressed problems of different kinds of differential equations. The results are promising, with exact solutions obtained for most of the addressed problems, which include equations where not even commercial systems could find a symbolic solution. These results empirically indicate that GPAD can be an efficient and robust methodology to find analytic solutions for ODE and PDE.","","978-1-5090-0623-6","10.1109/CEC.2016.7748362","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748362","","Mathematical model;Sociology;Statistics;Genetic programming;Computers;Partial differential equations","differentiation;genetic algorithms;mathematics computing;partial differential equations","genetic programming;automatic differentiation algorithms;ordinary differential equations;partial differential equations;evolutionary algorithms;ODE;PDE;chain rule;numerical differentiation methods;discretization process;Matlab programming environment;GPAD","","1","","11","","21 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Factors such as the increasing energy demand, the transfer of large amounts of power to meet the consumption, combined with the economic and environmental requirements has led the systems operate in stressful conditions (close to their limits), i.e., with small margins of security that is a threat to its stable operating condition. The combination of these factors can be disastrous, enabling the vulnerability of electrical power systems, i.e., exposed to risk of a situation of instability. In the literature, a study to analyze stability and voltage instability is related to the P-V curve (power versus voltage magnitude) and the maximum loading point (MLP) (point on the curve that separates the stable operation of the unstable). The maximum loading point may be consequent to a saddle node bifurcation (SNB) related to transmission capacity limit in an electrical system where the Jacobian matrix is singular, or limit induced bifurcation (LIB), related the reactive power limit of the generator, where the matrix is not singular.

First, there is the energy challenge: because the nodes are embedded in some kind of medium, such as soil, concrete, or debris of a disaster event, many of the traditional energy solutions for communication devices are ruled out. Second, typical radio-wave-based solutions are significantly impacted in underground settings due to the high signal attenuation in lossy medium, such as wet soil. To address such challenges, wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) have been proposed. However, the lack of real-world deployments is an indication that some WUSN aspects still need to be addressed. In this paper, a soil path attenuation model for a magnetic induction (MI)-based WUSN is developed and the best operating frequency range is identified. Next, a strategic frequency and coil adaptation scheme is added to the design resulting in an efficient system in terms of energy and application bandwidth (BW), which can operate under typical variations of the electrical properties of soils, for example, due to a rain or dryout event. The model and design guidelines are validated by preliminary experiments in outdoors, and more recently, an indoor MI-based testbed is carefully developed. We concluded that this submegahertz MI-based communication testbed can also be perceived as an accurate noncontact sensor for dielectric spectroscopy. Such findings have the potential of not only helping in the proliferation of WUSNs but also providing the foundation for novel instrumentation possibilities in many fields of science.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2015.2498918","Brazilian National Research Council Scholarship under the Brazilian Programme Science without borders; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332936","Dielectric measurement;electrochemical impedance;electromagnetic induction;impedance measurement;mutual coupling;soil measurements;spectroscopy;wireless sensor networks.;Dielectric measurement;electrochemical impedance;electromagnetic induction;impedance measurement;mutual coupling;soil measurements;spectroscopy;wireless sensor networks","Soil;Attenuation;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Relays;Sensors","coils;dielectric devices;electric sensing devices;electromagnetic induction;soil;underground communication;wireless sensor networks","dielectric spectroscopy;noncontact sensor;indoor MI-based testbed;electrical property;coil adaptation scheme;soil path attenuation model;WUSN;signal attenuation;radiowave-based solution;low-power wireless communication;midrange magnetic-induction-based wireless underground sensor network","","14","","33","","20 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These problems may greatly reduce reliability and ultimately lead to increased maintenance cost. This paper shows the method to overcome this problem by carrying out the dynamic strain measurement analysis in a TIM running at no-load condition, using an optical fiber sensor. The dynamic strain induced by mechanical and electrical forces was measured by using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), installed inside the motor, in between two stator teeth. The electromagnetic immunity and reduced size of the FBGs render them suitable for this application. The frequency components of the strain in TIM were predicted using a model of the forces present in the air gap, considering static and dynamic rotor eccentricities. Two TIM motors, one of 2-poles and the other of 4-poles, and each equipped with two FBGs strain sensors, were used. The sensors were positioned between two stator teeth, separated by 120° from each other in the 2-pole motor and 90° in the 4-pole motor. The experimental analysis shows that the frequency components of the dynamic force spectrum presented by the two motors are the same as those predicted theoretically. Rotor eccentricity was achieved by attaching an unbalanced load to the rotor shaft. The amplitude of vibration at rotor rotational frequency increased when the unbalanced load on the rotor shaft increased. The measurement presented in this paper can be used to determine some TIM parameters, such as the effect of the motor power supply on its vibration signal. It can also be used as a potential maintenance tool for the continuous monitoring of the TIM with high sensitivity.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2554885","Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos; Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute; Fundação Araucária; Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica; Tractebel Energia Research and Development Program for Scholarships and Research Funding; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453134","Induction motors;Fiber Bragg gratings;motor eccentricity;optical strain sensor;rotor eccentricity;vibration measurement;Induction motors;fiber Bragg gratings;motor eccentricity;optical strain sensor;rotor eccentricity;vibration measurement","Stators;Rotors;Strain;Sensors;Induction motors;Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings;fibre optic sensors;force measurement;force sensors;induction motors;machine insulation;reliability;rotors;shafts;stators;strain measurement;strain sensors","optical fiber Bragg grating strain sensor;mechanical force measurement;electrical force measurement;three-phase induction motor;TIM;vibration problem;reliability;maintenance cost;dynamic strain measurement analysis;FBG;stator teeth;air gap;rotor shaft eccentricity","","19","","18","","15 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we describe in this paper a sidewalk-based model for wheelchair route planning. The model is a graph in which vertices are corners that makeup city blocks and edges are sidewalks or pedestrian crossings. Namely, we automatically build a coarse graph from geographic information system maps (endorsed by discrete features, such as points, lines, polygons). Then, based on user feedback, the graph model is refined so as to indicate the wheelchair-accessible sidewalks and crosswalks. To evaluate our model we considered a neighborhood in a Brazilian city. However, the user feedback have shown severe issues to the city connectivity, mainly due to the lack of curb ramps. We show that such issues can be reduced by adding k shortcut edges, suggested by a greedy algorithm, in a refined graph, so as to minimize the weighted average shortest path distance over all pairs of vertices.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795938","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795938","","Urban areas;Wheelchairs;Collaboration;Planning;Maintenance engineering;Google;Geometry","geographic information systems;graph theory;greedy algorithms;handicapped aids;optimisation;path planning;traffic information systems;wheelchairs","shortcut suggestion;collaborative user feedback;wheelchair route planning;wheelchair users;sidewalk-based model;city blocks;pedestrian crossings;geographic information system map;wheelchair-accessible sidewalks;wheelchair-accessible crosswalks;Brazilian city;city connectivity;curb ramp;greedy algorithm;graph refinement;weighted average shortest path distance minimization","","2","","16","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hardware and software development for the consumer electronics and telecommunication sectors are the most challenging areas, due to the amount of open positions contrasting with the quality of local educational Institutions. To address this issue a local higher education organization (Institute of Computing of the Federal University of Amazonas) started, in partnership with Samsung da Amazonia Ltd. (the local subsidiary of the Korean conglomerate), a large scale program based on the so called multiple vortices, and comprising of set of involving activities, including training in classroom, and enrolling students in initiation or graduate projects. After three year of running program, the authors proposed a survey to verify the results achieved so far, more specifically on those two mentioned activities. The survey is designed to answer two questions: A) How mature is the participant in understanding his career; B) How is the participant's perception of the program efficiency in meeting his expectations. The survey is composed by 41 yes/no questions covering five different topics: 1) Perception about career and marked demands; 2) Information about the program purpose and objectives; 3) Changes in the career plan and expectations of the future; 4) Perceived relevance of the program; 5) Strength and weaknesses of the running program. Anti-redundant questions (i.e. two answers leads the same conclusion when one is yes and the other is no) were used to reduce bias and to assign a confidence level to the respondent, afterwards used to weight the student's contribution to the final statistics. The survey was applied to current and former program participants. The paper will detail the results, and the corrective actions suggested by the students' answers. Furthermore, the survey itself, the design and application methodology, which was based on a pilot group of students, will be part of the results presented in this paper.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757392","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757392","formatting;style;styling;insert","Context;Engineering profession","educational institutions;further education;STEM","STEM education program evaluation survey;capital of Brazilian Amazon state;consumer electronics;software development;hardware development;telecommunication sector;local educational institution quality;local higher education organization;partnership;Samsung da Amazonia Ltd;classroom training;graduate project;participant perception;program efficiency;marked demand;career plan;future expectation;antiredundant question","","1","","9","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the large amount of information available is not sufficient to ensure the development of future learners in technical disciplines, such as Computer Science and Engineering disciplines. High dropout rates and failure in this type of course are common in Brazilian Universities and few initiatives are taken to improve the situation. Nevertheless, the labor market demands of its workers technological training, especially in informatics. By coordinating a work group to develop the project “Integrated Student” for two consecutive years at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), we proposed innovative teaching strategies used both for the development of the course participants and for the tutor's academic lives. Under a constructivist look on Piaget's view it was found that we need to enhance one main ability of students, teachers and tutors of technological courses: mediation. The methodology used was the basis for the creation of a model of distance learning courses in technical areas, to be started in the coming years. We approach, particularly, in the progress made in the preparation of tutors, students of Computer Science and Engineering, which, in most cases, decided to continue their academic lives with the completion of a Master in Information Technology area or even start his career as teachers.","","978-1-5090-6149-5","10.1109/LACLO.2016.7751745","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751745","e-Learning;mediation;design education","Computers;Electronic learning;Operating systems;Mentoring;Computer aided instruction;Computer science","distance learning;educational courses;educational institutions;learning management systems;teaching","technological distance learning;integrated student project;scientific knowledge;distance education;learning management systems;LMS;Internet;Brazilian Universities;computer science;engineering disciplines;labor market;technological training;Federal University of Espirito Santo;UFES;innovative teaching strategy;course participant development;Piaget view;mediation;distance learning courses;information technology","","","","17","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This hybrid method handles the different levels of the proposed multi-level framework. The two-stage multi-dimensional MSA is a recently developed optimisation algorithm, which is derived from the harmony search algorithm (HSA). Unlike the HSA, the MSA uses different player memories and a group improvisation procedure for finding the best substitution of pitches within a melody. These two features can enhance the performance of the MSA in comparison with the HSA. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the proposed MSA, an innovative improvisation scheme based on the AIP is used for generating new melodies. The proposed methodology has been applied on the 46-bus south Brazilian electric power grid and the IEEE 118-bus test system under two different scenarios in order to demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of the newly developed framework.

The main dynamic capabilities identified were: ability to manage uncertainties; ability to create and participate in networks, ability to attract external resources; attract and retain innovative people; adaptability and strategic flexibility. These are the dynamic capabilities that had different grades of influences in innovation of both companies.

Location of distributed generation is also evaluated. The most suitable locations to connect distributed generation sources are identified by modal analysis through participation factors. These participation factors indicate sensitive areas of the system associated with active and reactive power.

The factors that affect the decisions of the software project managers (SPMs) and their potential consequences require attention because project delays and failures are usually related to a series of poor decisions. Objective: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace, and also to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large private organization. The data was analyzed using techniques from grounded theory approach. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator before making decisions. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, communication, negotiation, self-control and systemic view of the project and by contextual factors such as the autonomy of the SPM and team members' technical competence. Also, these factors are mediated by cognitive biases.

The OPF is formulated for predominantly hydro systems, in which power dispatch is carried out taking into consideration target values of active power generation available from long and medium term operational plans. To solve the bilevel OPF, the objective functions of the upper and lower problems approximated by smooth functions. The bilevel OPF is transformed into a single level OPF by substituting the optimality conditions of the lower level problem into the upper level one. The solutions of the resulting problem are expressed via Fritz-John (FJ) optimality conditions and obtained using the primal-dual interior point method. Results obtained for the IEEE 14-bus test system and a 352-bus equivalent of the Brazilian system indicate that the optimization model can be a useful tool to establish how generators participate in the provision of reactive support.","","978-88-941051-2-4","10.1109/PSCC.2016.7540827","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7540827","Bilevel Optimal Power Flow;Reactive Power Supply;Fritz-John Optimality Conditions","Reactive power;Generators;Power generation;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Electronic mail;Load flow","load dispatching;load flow","bilevel optimal power flow;Fritz-John normalized optimality conditions;OPF model;power dispatch;interior point method;Brazilian system","","1","","20","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is usually calculated by the regulator and sets a cap to the amount a plant can trade in capacity markets (or auctions), in order to avoid free-riding behaviors. Firm energy is a systemic property and, in case of hydro plants, a synergy is observed whenever a cooperative operation occurs, i.e., the firm energy of a system is greater than the sum of the individual plants. In this case an interesting problem is how to allocate the synergic benefits in a fair way. It is shown in this work that this criterion is equivalent to the calculation of the core of a cooperative game. The objective of this work is to investigate the application of different allocation methods of firm energy rights among hydro plants using a game-theoretic framework. However, calculating the core constraints for realistic systems is a large scale linear-programming problem. This work discusses alternatives to the calculating the core constraints, presenting a MIP model, discussing its limitations and future approaches. These methods are based on the constraints relaxation to handle the difficulty caused by its exponential growth with the number of constraints in the problem with the increase in the agent's number.

Therefore, it was adopted a single case study as research strategy, applied in a Brazilian industry of consumption goods, on the market for over 85 years. The results obtained in the documentary analysis, questionnaires, interviews and literature show that the Accounting Management Information System (AMIS) contributes to the management of Intellectual Capital. In the investigated organization, AMIS is widely used and shows similarities with the specifications found in the literature, possessing the ability of adaptation to receive indicators or variables that enable the management of Intellectual Capital. It was found that the incorporation of the variables of Intellectual Capital in AMIS could be accomplished by adopting the method proposed by López-Ruiz and Nevado-Pena, that uses both traditional financial indicators and indicators of Intellectual Capital, not conflicting with the traditional AMIS, but complementing it.

In practice, most of these indicators are evaluated graphically and their direct impact on the quality of stock price forecasting has not been appraised so far. Therefore, the impact of different technical indicators on the prediction of stock closing prices was evaluated in this paper. Under the machine learning perspective, each technical indicator was used as input for artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptrons) trained to forecast the daily stock closing prices of five companies with high representation in the Brazilian IBovespa index. The results have led to two main conclusions: (i) lagging technical indicators such as the Exponential Moving Average and Weighted Moving Average, when used as isolated inputs of the neural networks, can improve the accuracy of the stock forecast when compared to forecasts made with the original series of closing prices; and (ii) the combination of different indicators as inputs to the same neural network can improve even more the forecasting performance.

Previous results showed that L-band is more appropriate for such applications. However, SAR images have limited discriminability for mapping large sets of classes compared with optical imagery. The objective of this study was to carry out an analysis about the discriminative capability of an L-band fully polarimetric SAR complex image, compared to the possible subsets of polarizations in amplitude/intensity, for mapping land cover classes in Amazon regions. Two case studies using ALOS PALSAR L-band fully polarimetric images over Brazilian Amazon regions were considered. Several thematic classes, organized into scenarios, were considered for each case study. These scenarios represent distinct classification tasks with variated complexities. Performing a simultaneous analysis of different scenarios is a distinct way to assess the discriminative capability offered by a particular image. A methodology to organize thematic classes into scenarios is proposed in this study. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), with specific distributions for SAR data, and support vector machine were considered in this study. The iterated conditional modes algorithm was adopted to incorporate the contextual information in both methods. Considering a kappa coefficient equal to 0.8 as an acceptable minimum, the experiments show that none subset of polarization or fully polarimetric image allows performing discrimination between forest and regeneration types; single-polarized HV data provide acceptable results when the classification problem deals with the discrimination of a few classes; depending on the classification scenario, the dual-polarized HH+HV image produces similar results when compared to multipolarized (i.e., HH+HV+VV) data; in turn, if the MLC method is adopted, multipolarized data may produce close or statistically indifferent classification results compared to those produced with the use of fully polarimetric data.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2594133","FAPESP; UNESP/PROPe; CNPq; NSF; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551247","Amazon;assessment;image classification;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR);scenarios;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;L-band;Sensors;Covariance matrices;Earth;Remote sensing;Support vector machines","land cover","PALSAR L-band fully polarimetric data;land cover classification;tropical environments;synthetic aperture radar data;rain forest areas;optical imagery;Brazilian Amazon regions;maximum likelihood classifier;polarimetric image;single-polarized HV data","","2","","38","","24 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DitacTronic is a portable and low-cost platform whose goal is to include students from electrical engineering courses and high school students in the innovative world of technology and motivate them to learn by doing design work. A device like this allows them to see concepts presented in theoretical classes, such as physics and electronic, put in action. DitacTronic permits that because it's a portable lab. Oscilloscope, measurement equipment, and basic components are included in this platform. The DitacTronic connects with tablets and smartphones, through Arduino's Bluetooth module, so that the students may use them as a visor to monitor signals, inputs and outputs from DitacTronic or other circuits. Students and professors worked together to overcome one of biggest challenges in the Brazilian Universities: the gap between theory and practice. Therefore, the solution needs to be simple, cheap and replicable. There are many expensive solutions available, but they are not affordable to everyone, everywhere. The research team hopes to disseminate DitacTronic and its principles. The IEEE SIGHT PUC Minas supports this project and is sharing with many engineering students.","","978-1-5090-2432-2","10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857296","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857296","portable lab;education;electronic;Arduino;mobile devices;prototyping","Resistors;Voltage measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Light emitting diodes;Microprogramming;Bluetooth;Voltmeters","analogue circuits;Bluetooth;digital circuits;educational courses;electronic engineering education;smart phones","DidacTronic;portable didactic lab;analog electronic circuits;digital electronic circuits;electrical engineering courses;high school students;physics;oscilloscope;measurement equipment;tablets;smartphones;Arduino;Bluetooth module;Brazilian universities;IEEE SIGHT PUC Minas","","2","","27","","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An event with strong winds gust and a large number atmospheric discharge can increase the outages' quantity in a hard to predictable form and, consequently, impact in the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI). A modelling of such weather impact in failure rate is useful for a better understand of it, allowing utilities to take actions to understatement it or, even, mitigate its consequences in real time. Based on it, this paper analyses the response of Negative Binomial Regression in comparison with the Poisson Regression, using outages data (quantity) from a Brazilian distribution utility and meteorological information as wind gust speed and number of thunders, to estimate the number of expected outages and, consequently, the failure rate per kilometer. The focus is to provide a model that emulates the behaviour of system components and parts during a climatic event of any intensity and has more resilient against the outliers normally presented in this type of data set. The results indicate a significant influence of the wind gust speed, and, based on goodness-of-fit index as Akaike Information Criterion and the analysis of the outliers, the Negative Binomial Regression as the best response.

Besides the Black and Scholes closed-form formula simplicity and good results for pricing European options, several of the assumptions used in the method may be unrealistic and influence the results significantly. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper suggests an evolving possibilistic fuzzy modeling (ePFM) approach for European equity options pricing. The approach is based on an extension of the possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering and functional fuzzy rule-based modeling. ePFM employs memberships and typicalities to recursively cluster data, and uses participatory learning to adapt the model structure as a stream data is input. The model does not require any assumptions about data distribution, it is an effective robust method to handle noisy data and outliers in option price dynamics modeling, and it is also capable to access volatility clustering due to its clustering-based nature. Computational experiments consider the pricing of European equity options (calls and puts) on preference shares of Petrobras (PETR4), one of the most liquidity options traded in the Brazilian derivatives market. The results show that ePFM is a potential candidate for equity options pricing, with comparable or better performance than the Black and Scholes method and alternative evolving fuzzy approaches.","","978-1-5090-2583-1","10.1109/EAIS.2016.7502372","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502372","","Adaptation models;Pricing;Data models;Europe;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Noise measurement","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;pricing","financial derivatives;risk management;hedge operations;Black and Scholes closed-form formula simplicity;evolving possibilistic fuzzy modeling approach;ePFM approach;European equity options pricing;c-means clustering;functional fuzzy rule-based modeling;participatory learning;model structure;volatility clustering;Petrobras;PETR4;Brazilian derivatives market","","","","30","","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the brazilian railways, due to the limited duplication of railways, trains that travel in single sections should make mandatory stops to wait for other trains to use a loop crossing safely. Technological developments resulted in the emergence of new rail traffic control systems. However, rail drive systems that make use of software agents are still poorly explored. In this study we designed a Multi-Agent System capable of simulating the railway environment using conducting agents on trains and also agents at a higher level of control with the process of management skills. The behaviour of the agents was based on specialized driving rules and coordination between them through the exchange of messages, always with the objective of avoiding stops during the trip. Results showed an average reduction of 22.5% in travel time and 25.5% in fuel consumption compared to trips using the traditional method of driving. The reduction in travel and time consumption also results in reducing CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels.","","978-1-5090-3474-1","10.1109/IECON.2016.7792964","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792964","","Rail transportation;Security;Licenses;Software agents;Rails;Intelligent systems;Acceleration","control engineering computing;fossil fuels;fuel economy;multi-agent systems;rail traffic control;railway safety;software agents","autonomous driving freight trains;bidirectional crossing loop;software agents;railroad stretch;environmental impacts;Brazilian railways;railway safety;rail traffic control systems;multi-agent system;fuel consumption;fossil fuels","","","","27","","22 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

General purpose modeling languages and current tool support to model security concerns exist. However, they lack a comprehensive solution that includes tool support for verification of security goal completeness and risk analysis in specific domains. Also, communication between stakeholders in large-scale systems is difficult, specially because security is not the core skill of many requirements engineers. To overcome these challenges in the electronic voting domain, we developed EVSec, a domain-specific visual modeling language. EVSec is process-centric language and allows modelers expressing activities and social interactions, while identifying security concerns with associated risks. Comprehensive tool support provides security goals completeness and assists users on the identification of critical parts of the model with higher security risks.

Based on data from its operation within the real ENAP distance learning environment, the proposed plugin is particularly successful to tackle the enrollment locking cases that compose the student dropout rate and also to motivate course enrolled students to access the virtual learning system more frequently.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757608","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757608","Automatic messaging;Moodle plugin;Distance learning motivating tool","Computer aided instruction;Electronic mail;Databases;Communication systems;Electronic learning;Learning systems","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses","attendee participation;automatic messaging plugin;Moodle platform;information and communications systems;geographical location;distance learning schools;course management systems;CMS;e-learning platform;e-mail messages;distance learning courses;dropout rates;general coordination of distance education;CGEAD;Brazilian National School of Public Administration;ENAP distance learning environment;virtual learning system","","","","10","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Unsupervised Quaternion Feature Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification","V. Risojević; Z.

However, in order to achieve state-of-the-art results, complex hand-crafted feature filters and/or support vector classifiers with nonlinear kernels are needed. Compared with hand-crafted features, unsupervised feature learning is a popular alternative, which results in feature filters adapted to the problem domain at hand. Although both color and intensity are important cues for remote sensing image classification and color images are commonly used for unsupervised feature learning, most of the existing algorithms do not take into account interrelationships between intensity and color information. We address this problem using quaternion representation for color images and propose unsupervised learning of quaternion feature filters, as well as feature encoding using quaternion orthogonal matching pursuit (Q-OMP). By using quaternion representation, we are able to jointly encode intensity and color information in an image. We obtain local descriptors by soft thresholding and computing absolute values of scalar and three vector parts of the quaternion-valued sparse code. Local descriptors are pooled, power-law transformed, and normalized, yielding the resulting image representation. The experimental results on UC Merced Land Use and Brazilian Coffee Scenes datasets are comparable or better than the state of the art, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed method for quaternion feature learning is able to adapt to the characteristics of the available data, and being fully unsupervised, it emerges as a viable alternative to both hand-crafted representations and convolutional neural networks, especially in application scenarios with scarce-labeled training data.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2513898","Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Srpska; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387668","Quaternion image processing;remote sensing image classification;sparse image representations;unsupervised feature learning;Quaternion image processing;remote sensing image classification;sparse image representations;unsupervised feature learning","Quaternions;Image color analysis;Remote sensing;Image representation;Image coding;Color;Matching pursuit algorithms","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;terrain mapping","hand-crafted representation;convolutional neural network;scarce-labeled training data;quaternion feature learning;Brazilian coffee scene;UC Merced land use;power-law transformed;quaternion-absolute value;quaternion representation;Q-OMP;quaternion orthogonal matching pursuit;color information;color image;unsupervised feature learning;problem domain;hand-crafted feature;support vector classifier;hand-crafted feature filter;state-of-the-art results;retrieval task;image classification;bag-of-words image representation;unsupervised quaternion feature learning;remote sensing image classification","","15","","42","","20 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these strategies is the outsourcing of activities. Researches over the years have addressed the process of production outsourcing, but the outsourcing of New Product Development (NPD) activities is a relatively new phenomenon. This paper aims at analyzing this phenomenon in the Brazilian Volkswagen subsidiary in order to know the reasons why the company performs the outsourcing of activities regarding new product development. It also addresses the factors that affect the decisions of outsourcing. The analyses were conducted in the light of the Resource-based view and Transaction Costs. The results reveal two ways of outsourcing: engineering services and product development. The former occurs when the automaker is in charge of the equipment, risk and rework. The latter occurs when a set of tasks is subcontracted. Thus, the supplier is in charge of the equipment, financial and rework risks. The reasons for subcontracting are the lack of an important resource that the company does not have to complete the development internally and the lack of capability to perform certain activities, reduce costs and limit headcount.","","978-1-5090-3595-3","10.1109/PICMET.2016.7806818","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806818","","Technology management;Technological innovation;Outsourcing;History","automobile industry;outsourcing;product development","outsourcing;new product development activities;automaker;Brazilian Volkswagen subsidiary;cost reduction","","","","22","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method yields an assessment of the location of the nontechnical losses now and in the future at the city subarea level, even indicating the variables that have greater statistical correlation with the nontechnical losses. We apply the method to a city with approximately 81 000 consumers, and the results are compared with those obtained through inspections carried out by a Brazilian power utility.

In this paper, we cope with the early detection of the first signs of deforestation, which is the gateway for illegal activities, such as unauthorized urban sprawl and grazing use. In recent years, object-based approaches have emerged as a more suitable alternative than pixel-based methods for change detection in remote sensing images. Even though several classifiers have been tested, there was little effort in selecting appropriated features for the classification of detected changes. After a deep analysis of the existing segmentation, feature extraction, and classification approaches, we propose an object-based methodology that consists of: 1) segmenting multitemporal Xband high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images into superpixels employing the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm; 2) extracting features using the object correlation images framework and with the gray-level cooccurrence matrix; and 3) classifying areas into unchanged, deforestation, and other changes by means of a multilayer perceptron supervised learning technique. Experiments were performed using high-resolution SAR images obtained by the airborne sensor OrbiSAR-2 from BRADAR in challenging scenarios of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, including a wide variety of vegetation, rivers, sea coasts, urban, harvest and open areas, and humidity changes.

The practices and trends of incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into education, published in the past five years, points to a trend of simply transposing everyday ICT into school processes, without taking into account the necessary pedagogical, technical and conceptual adjustments, nor other factors of the educational complexity. This paper presents an alternative application of an extension to TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge) framework model with CCI (integrated cognitive skills) application for incorporation of technology in the educational process as a way of overcoming these difficulties. The combined application of technological and pedagogical skills in this hybridized model allows the enhancement of learning processes by thinking of education and technology as integrated tools, becoming absolutely vital for better understanding, rethinking and reformulating syllabi, educational policies and practices so as to improve teaching processes.","","978-9-8998-4346-2","10.1109/CISTI.2016.7521433","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521433","competences;technology;education;pedagogy;learning","Education;Internet;Information and communication technology;Instruments;Information management;Market research;Bills of materials","cognition;computer aided instruction;teaching;technology management","technology pedagogy and content knowledge framework;TPACK framework;integrated cognitive competency;information and communication technology;ICT;learning process enhancement;teaching process improvement","","","","","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this aim, several monitors are employed to capture wireless exchanges in a target area. Monitors potentially generate large traces that are all merged together to have a more complete, global view of the network behavior. Traces are often more equal than complementary, leading to the underutilization of monitors and to a higher system complexity. In this paper, we propose a methodology to make an efficient use of monitors in order to increase scalability. Such a methodology, based on trace similarity and community detection in graphs, ranks traces to reveal how many and which ones must be merged. Traces at the bottom of the rank, which belong to under-used monitors, are candidates to be relocated somewhere else to extend the target area. We evaluate the proposed methodology in two real-case scenarios. Results show that we can remove up to half of the monitors in our scenarios and still keep the same level of coverage.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2015.2477809","French National Research Agency (ANR); ANR VERSO RESCUE; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254177","Wireless networks;IEEE 802.11;measurement;monitoring;scalability;Wireless networks;IEEE 802.11;measurement;monitoring;scalability","Monitoring;Merging;Wireless communication;Scalability;Mobile computing;Measurement;Sensors","graph theory;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","community detection;trace similarity;WLAN monitoring systems;wireless exchanges;scalable wireless traffic capture","","2","","27","","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The intelligent system is composed of a genetic algorithm (GA) that seeks the best parameters (the number of nodes in the input and hidden layers, and the training algorithm) of an artificial neural network (ANN) of type multiLayer perceptron (MLP). The proposed method called Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) is a data-driven approach, that performs a pos-processing, where the objective is to reduce the difference between the forecasting and the actual series.

The platinum screen-printed electrodes were chemically modified by dipping in 1HF(49%):10H2O solution (d-HF) for times ranging from 10 to 120 min to obtain a three-electrodes potentiostatic cell for acetylene detection. Cyclic voltammetry indicated voltage-separation decreasing of the redox peaks and peak-current increasing when time in d-HF was increased. Surface morphology has changed after dipping in d-HF.

Since then, diverse models that use as parameter the time of execution of software or the time between failures have been considered. Another approach indicates that the use of code coverage, instead of execution time, yields better estimates of the reliability of the software. This paper presents the results observed in an experiment carried out to compare the software reliability models Binomial Model based on Coverage (BMBC) and Infinite Failure Software Reliability Model Based on Code Coverage (IFMBC) with the following models based on time domain: Geometric (GEO), Littlewood-Linear Verral (LAV-L), Littlewood-Quadratic Verral (LAVQ), Musa Basic (MS-B), Musa Logarithmic (MS-L) and Non-Homogeneous Poisson Model (NHP). These models, in addition to being much quoted in the literature, are implemented by SMERFS^3, used to calculate its parameters and to estimate reliability. As a result, it has been observed that traditional models do not provide robustness when the profile was changed. On the other hand, code coverage-based models have produced good results for all operational profiles.

Specifically, we consider the problem of resource allocation, particularly when user demands are uncertain. We formulate several two-stage sequential stochastic allocation schemes that provide tradeoffs between cost and user satisfaction. These allocation schemes are studied under different resource provider pricing models. Our simulations demonstrate that: First, while reducing cost significantly, virtualization considerably improves user satisfaction, and virtualization gains increase with the number of operators that share resources. Second, the improvements in cost, user satisfaction, and resource usage increase substantially with the level of user clustering.","2331-9860","978-1-4673-9292-1","10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444934","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444934","Virtualized wireless networks;resource allocation;capacitated set cover problem;multi-stage sequential optimization","Resource management;Wireless networks;Mobile communication;Stochastic processes;Mobile computing;Virtualization;Optimization","mobile radio;radio access networks;resource allocation;virtualisation","virtualized wireless access networks;common resource pool;resource sharing;mobile wireless networks;virtualization-based paradigm;resource allocation problem;two-stage sequential stochastic allocation;user satisfaction","","8","","10","","31 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application scenario considers two commercial aircraft in cruise flight in which the wingman aircraft is flying in tight formation with a leader aircraft. The design problem consists in describing the wake vortex influence on the wingman as norm-bounded parametric uncertainties that will be incorporated as perturbations to normalized coprime factors of the shaped plant. As a consequence, a novel robust control method for the fuel saving formation flight problem is presented. A set of sufficient conditions for the existence of such controller is given in an LMI framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is illustrated considering an example with three phases of formation flight: forming up, maintaining formation and leaving formation.","","978-1-4673-8345-5","10.1109/MED.2016.7535906","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535906","H∞ loop shaping control;Formation flight;Vortex effects;Fuel saving;LMI","Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Uncertainty;Fuels;Aerodynamics;Robust control;Linear matrix inequalities","aerospace control;control system synthesis;H∞ control;linear matrix inequalities;robust control","norm-bounded parametric uncertainties;normalized coprime factors;robust control method;fuel saving formation flight problem;LMI framework;wake vortex;wingman aircraft;cruise flight;commercial aircraft;fuel saving formation flight;adverse vortex effects;H∞ loop shaping control design;H∞ approach;tight formation flight control","","1","","30","","8 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wave polarimetry concepts are used to define HP features that are used to observe targets at sea. The sensitivity of HP features to both targets and the surrounding environment is analyzed through a novel objective norm, namely the Relative Sensitivity for Polarimetric Features (RSPolF) index. Detection performance is evaluated by the novel Dependency of Sea state and Target (DoST) surface characteristics metric, and by the well-known Figure of Merit (FoM). Experiments undertaken on HP measurements emulated from Radarsat-2 and ALOS-PALSAR full-polarimetric actual SAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HP approach and the different sensitivity of HP features to targets and background sea characteristics. Following those results, a ranking of the HP features performance is proposed which mainly highlights that HP features complement each other in the detection process. Finally, a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approach is proposed to exploit two HP features for target detection in an unsupervised way.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2015.2424751","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112185","Hybrid polarization;performance metrics;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing;wave polarimetry;sea surface;target detection","Synthetic aperture radar;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Feature extraction;Polarization","object detection;oceanographic techniques;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar","hybrid-polarity features;metallic targets;sea detection;hybrid-polarity synthetic aperture radar architecture;wave polarimetry;relative sensitivity for polarimetric features index;Dependency of Sea state and Target surface characteristics;Radarsat-2;ALOS-PALSAR full-polarimetric ac- tual SAR data;constant false alarm rate","","12","","34","","22 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It seems a reasonable and feasible model for Brazilian biopharmaceutical companies, as most of them do not have research and activity-development background, nor cross-disciplinary teams or even equipment that are crucial for the development stages of innovative pharmaceutical products. In contrast, some Brazilian public institutions, such as research institutions, have some worldwide known researchers in different fields of knowledge, and also a lot of world-class equipment.

Hence, even small improvements in the B50 and W10/400 parameters are considered to be great achievements. In order to verify if such improvements really translate into real gains in electrical motors, a series of prototypes was constructed with newly developed electrical steels. The core losses of these prototypes were determined by the loss segregation method. Test results support the conclusion that the standard steel characterization parameters do not carry enough information for steel and motor manufacturers to conclude on the performance of an electrical steel grade.

The motivation of this study is on estimating the position of the throttle device when measurements of the position are inaccessible, e.g., due to failures in the sensor of position. In this case, an external wattmeter is connected in the circuitry to measure the power consumed by the throttle, and this information feeds UKFs to produce the estimation for the position. Experimental data support the findings of this paper. Almost all of the brand-new vehicles based on spark-ignition combustion engines have an electronic throttle valve to control the power produced by the engine. The electronic throttle has a unique sensor for measuring the position of the throttle valve, and this feature can represent a serious problem when the sensor of position fails. As an attempt to prevent the effects of a failure from such a sensor, we present an algorithm (UKF) combined with the use of an additional sensor, i.e., a wattmeter. The wattmeter is detached from the throttle's structure but is arranged to measure the electric power consumed by the throttle. Measurements of the power consumption then feed the UKF. This filter then produces an estimation of the position of the throttle valve.

Contaminated beverages, resulting not only from an uncontrolled production process but also from deliberate adulteration, may contain nonsafe amounts of methanol leading to risks for consumers. Ethanol and methanol share similar physical-chemical properties. Both are colorless, soluble in water, and they have very close values of density. Although analytical laboratorial methods can precisely determine the alcoholic composition, rapid distinction between them is a conundrum. This paper proposes and compares two methods that can be used to fast detect the contamination of alcoholic beverages with methanol. Despite the proximity between densities of methanol and ethanol, as well as the close refractive indexes of methanol and water, it is shown that these macroscopic parameters can be used together to analyze the beverage composition. Additionally, using the fingerprinting molecular analysis provided by Raman spectroscopy and a statistical procedure based on principal component analysis, it is shown a rapid method for the detection of methanol presence in beverages above a pre-established level, without the need for addition of any standard to the sample. The performances of both methods were tested and validated with samples containing different amounts of water, ethanol, and methanol and beverages deliberately contaminated with methanol.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2016.2522656","CNPq; CAPES; FINEP; Fundação Araucária Brazilian Agencies; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393659","Contaminated beverages;methanol contamination;Raman spectroscopy;refracto-densitometry","Methanol;Temperature measurement;Alcoholic beverages;Pollution measurement;Sea measurements;Raman scattering","beverages;chemical sensors;contamination;fibre optic sensors;food safety;organic compounds;principal component analysis;Raman spectroscopy;refractive index;water","light-assisted detection;contaminated spirits;artisanal alcoholic beverages;contaminated beverages;physical-chemical properties;analytical laboratorial method;alcoholic composition;conundrum;alcoholic beverage contamination;refractive index;beverage composition;fingerprinting molecular analysis;Raman spectroscopy;statistical procedure;principal component analysis;methanol presence detection;preestablished level","","4","","24","","27 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The shared information in the network can prevent significant degradation or the interruption of the estimation process when a particular network node fails. However, the estimation accuracy can be severely degraded if delayed information is navely fused. The classical algorithm to fuse delayed measurements in a distributed network is the reiterated Kalman filter (RKF), which provides the optimal estimate in linear and Gaussian systems. Nevertheless, this algorithm imposes a huge computational burden and requires considerable memory when the delay is large, thus precluding the use of RKF in embedded systems that lack the needed computational resources. Previously, we proposed a suboptimal algorithm called measurement transportation (MT) that greatly reduces both the memory requirement and computational burden and delivers accuracy comparable to that of the RKF in a simulated UAV network. However, MT was only tested with numerical simulations. Here, we extend the previous investigation with the detailed analysis of MT regarding its accuracy, memory necessity, and computational burden. Cases are shown when the analysis predicts that the accuracy delivered by MT is comparable to that of the RKF and the theoretical results are then validated with a simulated distributed sensor network.","2373-776X","","10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2580461","Brazilian project FINEP/CTA/INPE; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490385","Measurement transportation (MT);delayed measurements;distributed estimation;sensor network;Kalman filtering","Delays;Estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Fuses;Heuristic algorithms;Covariance matrices;Information processing","distributed sensors;embedded systems;Kalman filters;numerical analysis;sensor fusion","measurement transportation algorithm;fuse delayed data;distributed sensor networks;robust dynamic system estimation;network node;reiterated Kalman filter;RKF;Gaussian systems;linear systems;embedded systems;suboptimal algorithm;simulated UAV network;numerical simulations","","","","31","","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to this fact and in order to reduce such requirement, herein we analyze the outage performance of two distributed TAS (DAS) schemes. One scheme employs maximal-ratio combining (DAS/MRC) at the destination, whereas the other employs selection combining (DAS/SC). We consider a dual-hop fixed-gain amplify-and-forward relaying network, equipped with multi-antenna source/relay nodes and a single-antenna destination. A lower bound expression is derived for the outage probability of each investigated scheme. Importantly, the derived bounds prove to be very tight approximations to the exact outage performance. Also, capitalizing on a strikingly interesting property of Stirling numbers of the second kind, we provide closed-form asymptotic expressions for the obtained bounds. Our results show that the diversity order of the proposed distributed schemes is identical to that of their optimal centralized counterparts, namely Nt + min(Nrr, Nrt), with Nt, Nrr, and Nrt denoting the number of transmit antennas at the source, the number of receive antennas at the relay, and the number of transmit antennas at the relay, respectively.

A noise-free ground-truth image may not be available, and different SNRs are simulated by injecting extra noise into an already noisy image. However, noise in real-world systems is typically signal dependent, with variance determined by the noise-free image. Thus, the noise to be injected shall also depend on the unknown ground-truth image. To circumvent this issue, we consider the additive injection of noise in variance-stabilized range, where no previous knowledge of the ground-truth signal is necessary. Specifically, we design a special noise-injection operator that prevents the errors on expectation and variance that would otherwise arise when standard variance-stabilizing transformations are used for this task.

Air traffic control (ATC) services and airlines have been involved in the current CDM, but airport management service, an important stakeholder, has not been involved yet, generally. This paper proposes a new CDM model, which is named satisficing CDM, that is based on the satisficing game theory. This model includes three main entities (ATC, airlines, and airport management) in ATFM. The complete set of functions (preference, rejectability, and selectability) is established for each of the entities. Because the delay due to ground or air holding potentially alters the takeoff or the landing order of a flight, the sequence of takeoff and landing is determined through the satisficing negotiation process.

SDN enables the networks to be programmed according to the user requirements; furthermore, it allows the network to be easily modified to suit transient demands. However, how do we program the network? SDN-compliant switches offer a low-level interface that makes programming error-prone. The controllers provide application programming interfaces, but still low-level, limited, and inflexible. High-level languages have the potential to be a better alternative to program the network. There exist several SDN programming languages implementing different sets of functionalities, and focusing on solving various issues. In face of all this diversity, no published paper outlines a pragmatic view allowing to compare the SDN languages. This paper presents a systematic survey of up-to-date OpenFlow-based SDN programming languages. Our approach relies on a taxonomy comprising all prominent features found in those languages. A detailed review of the existing works is carried out investigating the foundational parts of the languages with their contributions. Examples are discussed to illustrate the fundamental abstractions. Last, all gathered information is summarized, discussing the main ongoing research efforts and challenges.

In addition, Cross Power Spectral Densities (CPSD) were acquired for different types of detectors and the correlation among those detectors was confirmed. It was also observed that there was no loss of correlation among the neutron pulses, and therefore, the CPSD curves demonstrated the presence of correlated events. The α parameter was used as an indicator for the comparison of the results and for the quality of the experimental data.

A solution for this problem is devised in this paper based on a set of Pareto-efficient encoding configurations, identified through rate-distortion-complexity analysis. The proposed method combines a medium-granularity encoding time control with a fine-granularity encoding time control to accurately limit the HEVC encoding time below a predefined target for each GOP. It is shown that the encoding time can be kept below a desired target for a wide range of encoding time reductions, e.g., up to 90% in comparison with the original encoder.

As an alternative to the widely used nonlinear compensation based on total-field DBP, we demonstrate that a coupled-equations DBP (CE-DBP) approach can be more computationally efficient and also more robust to a nonideal equalization of the receiver front-end in scenarios with limited sampling rate and electrical bandwidth. Employing a triple-carrier PM-16QAM superchannel placed in a 75-GHz slot of a WDM system, we demonstrate an ultralong-haul signal reach of 6600 km using CE-DBP, corresponding to 32% increase relatively to chromatic dispersion equalization (CDE). Targeting an highly spectral-efficient solution for 400G transmission in metro optical networks, these results are extended to a triple-carrier PM-64QAM superchannel placed in a 50-GHz slot, yielding a maximum signal reach of 1750 km through the use of CE-DBP in single-superchannel propagation, corresponding to approximately 60% increase over CDE.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2512661","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Brazilian Ministry of Communications and FUNTTEL/FINEP; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366538","Optical communication systems;superchannels;DSP;nonlinear compensatio;coupled equations;400G;WDM;Coupled equations;DSP;nonlinear compensation;optical communication systems;superchannels;WDM;400G","Modulation;Nonlinear optics;Optical polarization;Mathematical model;Wavelength division multiplexing;Complexity theory;Optical receivers","backpropagation;data communication;optical communication;phase modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;wavelength division multiplexing","multicarrier digital backpropagation;400G optical superchannels;digital nonlinear mitigation;next-generation optical 400G transmission systems;polarization-multiplexed modulation;coupled-equations DBP;receiver front-end;electrical bandwidth;triple-carrier PM-16QAM superchannel;ultralong-haul signal reach;chromatic dispersion equalization;spectral-efficient solution;distance 6600 km;distance 1750 km","","11","","42","","25 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One drawback of this measurement is the low sensitivity of the signal against changes in strain. This problem can be solved using inverse filter signal processing. This technique increases the sensitivity but also reduces the energy of the signal and, consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, a physical solution is presented to improve the sensitivity of the system. Additionally, the one-bit time reversal is introduced to simplify the hardware used in this technique. The strain sensing system is composed of a pair of piezocomposite transducers bonded to the surface of the tested plate and used to generate and sense the ultrasonic waves guided through the specimen. The use of time reversal provides phase compensation for dispersion and edge reflections in the propagation of the guided waves in the plate, allowing time recompression of the waves. The measurement principle is based on the detection of changes in the amplitude and time-of-flight of the focused signal when the plate is subjected to longitudinal strains. System sensitivity is improved using 2-2 piezocomposite transducers designed to operate between 0.2 and 3.0 MHz. In the signal processing, the one-bit time reversal is compared with the conventional time reversal in 12-bit resolution. A figure of merit is introduced to evaluate the influence of the transfer function on strain sensitivity. This figure of merit relates the energy concentrated at the time-reversal focus with the total energy of the signal. This value represents the ability of the time-reversal process to recompress the signal at the focus. The experiments were conducted by applying strains up to 150 μm/m. The results show a linear response in the change of the focus amplitude. The sensitivity depends on the transducers and it can be related to the proposed figure of merit. The focus quality is kept when one-bit time reversal is used, showing to be also feasible for the measuring technique.

The problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem considering the total load restored and the time required for restoration. A new encoding scheme is proposed, in which the variables that encode the switch operation are separated into six groups, according to their roles in the faulty system configuration. Employing the idea of defining subspaces of a combinatorial space, those groups are used in order to define subpermutations within which the crossover and mutation operations are performed. In this way, the dimensionality of the search space becomes reduced, allowing a much more efficient search. The proposed encoding scheme also makes a single individual to encode several different solutions, leading to a further reduction of the search space dimensionality. Due to this peculiar feature of the encoding scheme, it becomes convenient to use an adaptation of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, in which the raw fitness is modified in order to allow the assignment of fitness to individuals that simultaneously encode several different solutions. The proposed algorithm was implemented such that good solutions are delivered within low processing times, of the order of some minutes for large real systems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2015.2497361","Brazilian institutions Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais; Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL); ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317537","Electricity distribution networks;genetic algorithms;load restoration;multiobjective optimization","Yttrium;Switches;Optimization;Encoding;Power distribution;Decoding;Linear programming","combinatorial mathematics;distribution networks;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;power system restoration","power distribution networks;subpermutation-based evolutionary multiobjective algorithm;load restoration;distribution network restoration;biobjective optimization problem;encoding scheme;faulty system configuration;combinatorial space;search space dimensionality;strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm","","10","","34","","3 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These effects are investigated considering a switched capacitor filter prototyped in a Field Programmable Analog Array. Eight samples of such device were exposed to gamma radiation while the devices were alternately biased, by repeatedly turning the power on and off, corresponding to different equivalent total biasing times and duty-cycles. Results show increase in radiation tolerance to the alternate biased devices, which is dependent also on the biasing duty-cycle.

In this context, this paper presents the following contributions: 1) The use of a cognitive cooperative framework based on measurement-capable devices (MCDs) in order to provide valuable information both to generate and to update radio-environment maps for LSA repositories, thus enabling more dynamic spectrum-access opportunities. 2) A new distributed and cooperative scheme among cognitive MCDs to detect and classify incumbents and LSA licensees in the LSA network. The proposal suggests a clustering strategy for cooperative spectrum sensing when neighboring MCDs observe different licensed users-whether incumbents or LSA licensees. The clustering considers the differences in underlying hidden Markov models associated with the detection of distinct licensed users. 3) Theoretical expressions for the overall probability of detection and false alarm are derived for hard cooperation strategies that may include failed MCDs in the clustering process.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2500559","Brazilian research councils FAPERJ, CAPES, and CNPq; UPV/EHU (UFI 11/30); POSDOC program and the project IT-683-13 of the Basque Government; HEDYT-GBB project (TEC2012-33302) of the Spanish MINECO; RETEVISION I S.A.

To learn such models, the data samples are often clustered using the K-means algorithm with the Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity metric. However, the Euclidean distance may not always be a good dissimilarity measure for comparing data samples lying on a manifold. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for determining a local subset of training samples from which a good local model can be computed for reconstructing a given input test sample, where we consider the underlying geometry of the data. The first algorithm, called adaptive geometry-driven nearest neighbor search (AGNN), is an adaptive scheme, which can be seen as an out-of-sample extension of the replicator graph clustering method for local model learning. The second method, called geometry-driven overlapping clusters (GOCs), is a less complex nonadaptive alternative for training subset selection. The proposed AGNN and GOC methods are evaluated in image superresolution and shown to outperform spectral clustering, soft clustering, and geodesic distance-based subset selection in most settings.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2522303","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel Brazilian Agency for the Doctoral Sandwich Program Abroad Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393577","Clustering;patch manifolds;nearest neighbor search;Clustering;patch manifolds;nearest neighbor search;image super-resolution;image restoration","Manifolds;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Image resolution;Data models;Training;Adaptation models","computer vision;differential geometry;graph theory;image reconstruction;image resolution;inverse problems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","geodesic distance-based subset selection;soft clustering;spectral clustering;geometry-driven overlapping cluster;replicator graph clustering method out-of-sample extension;AGNN search adaptive scheme;adaptive geometry-driven nearest neighbor search;input test sample reconstruction;dissimilarity metric;Euclidean distance;K-means algorithm;computer vision applications;inverse problem;sparse image model;image superresolution;learning local model;geometry-aware neighborhood search","","3","","42","","26 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Services and applications over the IoT architecture can take benefit of the long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), cellular networks to support machine-type communication (MTC). Moreover, it is paramount that MTC do not affect the services provided for traditional human-type communication (HTC). Although previous studies have evaluated the impact of the number of MTC devices on the quality of service (QoS) provided to HTC users, none have considered the joint effect of allocation of control resources and the LTE random-access (RA) procedure. In this paper, a novel scheme for resource allocation on the packet downlink (DL) control channel (PDCCH) is introduced. This scheme allows PDCCH scheduling algorithms to consider the resources consumed by the random-access procedure on both control and data channels when prioritizing control messages. Three PDCCH scheduling algorithms considering RA-related control messages are proposed. Moreover, the impact of MTC devices on QoS provisioning to HTC traffic is evaluated. Results derived via simulation show that the proposed PDCCH scheduling algorithms can improve the QoS provisioning and that MTC can strongly impact on QoS provisioning for real-time traffic.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2557240","Brazilian Research Agencies CAPES and CNPq; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457594","LTE;Machine-Type Communications;PDCCH scheduling algorithm;Random-access procedure;LTE-A;Long-term evolution (LTE);LTE-Advanced (LTE-A);machine-type communications (MTCs);packet downlink control channel (PDCCH) scheduling algorithm;random-access (RA) procedure","Quality of service;Resource management;Uplink;Internet of things;Long Term Evolution;Downlink;Scheduling algorithms","cellular radio;Long Term Evolution;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","control resource allocation;machine-to-machine communication;human-to-human communication;LTE-LTE-A network;Internet of Things;IoT;virtually interconnected object;Long-Term Evolution Advanced;cellular network;machine-type communication;MTC;human-type communication;HTC;quality of service;QoS;random-access procedure;RA procedure;packet downlink control channel;PDCCH scheduling algorithm","","28","","31","","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method identified decisions that were shown to improve the future hypervolume of tradeoff investment portfolio sets for out-of-sample stock data, when compared to a myopic strategy. Anticipating flexible portfolios was a superior strategy for smoother changing artificial and real-world scenarios, when compared to always implementing the decision of median risk and to randomly selecting a portfolio from the evolved anticipatory stochastic Pareto frontier, whereas the median choice strategy performed better for abruptly changing markets.

The following key issues, relevant to underlay spectrum sharing and cooperative relaying, are considered: 1) the overall transmit power at the secondary network is constrained by both the maximum tolerable interference at the primary receiver and the maximum transmit power available at the secondary nodes; 2) under FD operation, the secondary relay is subject to residual self-interference, which is modeled as a fading channel; and 3) the signals coming from the secondary source and relay are handled at the secondary destination via maximal-ratio combining, in the HD relaying mode, and via a joint-decoding technique, in the FD relaying mode. We derive an exact analytical expression for the outage probability of the proposed scheme.

The additional superficial pinning centers were introduced at the YBa2Cu3O7-δ [YBCO(Ga)] single crystal surface by Ga ion beam bombardment. The field-cooled warming (MFCW(T)), field-cooled cooling (MFCC(T)), and zero-field-cooled (MZFC(T)) dc magnetizations were recorded, while magnetic fields H up to 50 kOe were applied parallel to the single crystal c-axis. MFCW(T) and MFCC(T) data show the usual superconductor diamagnetic response to H <;5 kOe. In contrast, when 5 kOe ≤ H ≤ 50 kOe was applied, MFCW(T) and MFCC(T), particularly for T≪Tirr (H) (magnetic irreversibility temperature), become paramagnetic. The magnetic-field-dependent paramagnetic behavior of MFCW(T) and MFCC(T) is the physical signature of HFPME in superconductor materials. We contrast the HFPME observed to the YBCO(Ga) sample with that observed to a not irradiated YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) single crystal.

The bit error rate (BER) and packet correct probability expressions are derived, considering the multiple-access interference as binomially distributed. Packet throughput expressions, on the other hand, are derived considering Poisson, binomial, and Markov chain approaches for the composite packet arrivals distributions, with the latter defined as benchmark. A throughput performance evaluation is carried out for two distinct user code sequences separately, namely, 1-D and 2-D multiweight multilength optical orthogonal code (MWML-OOC). Numerical results show that the Poisson approach underestimates the throughput performance in unacceptable levels and incorrectly predicts the number of successfully received packets for most offered load values even in favorable conditions, such as for the 2-D MWML-OOC OCDMA network with a considerably large number of simultaneous users.

Here, we consider coherent radio reflections routinely observed in ground-based global positioning system (GPS) reflectometry. Their footprint is often conceptualized in terms of the specular point (SP) and the first Fresnel zone (FFZ). Such infinitesimal point and finite zone can be generalized into a spatially continuous sensitivity kernel (SK). The SK represents a diffraction pattern, as the importance of each surface portion depends on its scattered field contribution in power and phase. We measured the SK of a GPS radio reflection under bipath reception conditions. The SK exhibited oscillations along the plane of incidence. The envelope of oscillations peaked near the SP and persisted in its decay well beyond the FFZ. Within the FFZ, sensitivity was skewed toward the antenna. This experiment suggests the feasibility of overcoming the diffraction limit and resolving features smaller than the FFZ with the exploitation of GPS diffraction patterns.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2579599","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; U.S. National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517333","Coherent;global navigation satellite system (GNSS);global positioning system (GPS);multipath;reflection;reflectometry","Global Positioning System;Antennas;Scattering;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Diffraction;Antenna measurements","diffraction;Global Positioning System;reflectometry;remote sensing","GPS diffractive reflectometry;coherent radio reflection;sensitivity kernel;multipath SNR;remote sensing environmental estimates;ground-based GPS reflectometry;Global Positioning System;specular point;first Fresnel zone;infinitesimal point;finite zone;surface portion;scattered field contribution;GPS radio reflection;bipath reception condition;GPS diffraction pattern","","8","","52","","20 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their first installations from 1940 s and their advantages make them an attractive and standard solution up to nowadays. However, passive filters have their filtering characteristics deteriorated due to parameter variation caused by aging or temperature. In addition, a capacitor bank for power factor correction is designed for specific loads and may not supply the right amount of reactive power when loads keep being added or changed. When these issues make the passive filter and the capacitor bank incapable to keep the system operating within acceptable level of power quality, an inconvenience arises and a solution must be provided. A common one is to replace both of them either by new elements or by active power compensators. However, replacing the passive filter and the capacitor bank may not be economically feasible, because they belong to a past investment. This paper presents a solution to overcome such inconvenience keeping the passive filter and the capacitor bank installed and unchanged. It consists of installing two shunt compensators specially designed for performing what the passive filter and the capacitor bank are incapable to do. The result is a reduced processed power in the compensators. The generation of the references is based on conservative power theory (CPT). A case study is presented to prove the compensators' efficacy and the power quality improvement.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2016.2544829","São Paulo Research Foundation; CNPq—Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438850","Active filters;power distribution;power filters;power quality","Power harmonic filters;Harmonic analysis;Capacitors;Passive filters;Power quality;Aging;Reactive power","ageing;passive filters;power capacitors;power factor correction;power filters;power supply quality;reactive power","passive filter;shunt compensators;conservative power theory;CPT;electrical system;power quality;capacitor bank;power factor correction;reactive power;active power compensators","","16","","23","","22 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SPA equations are derived in closed form for this model in terms of its parameters. It is then numerically observed that potentially large coding gains can be realized with respect to the Shannon limit by exploiting channel memory as opposed to ignoring it via interleaving.

We evaluated variations over time (2000-2015) in total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Passo Real reservoir, located in south Brazil. For this purpose, we tested two MODIS composite products: MOD09A1 and MCD43A4. Regression relationships of the red (TSS) and green (chlorophyll-a) reflectance of these products with limnological data of 12 field campaigns were obtained and compared to estimate these constituents on a per-pixel basis. Three major sections of the reservoir (upper, middle, and lower sections) were selected in the analysis. The results showed that the MODIS MCD43A4 (corrected for bidirectional effects) produced better estimates of TSS and chlorophyll-a than the MOD09A1 product. The highest concentrations of TSS were observed from September to October with the concomitant increase in precipitation and the predominance of exposed soils. The peak of TSS concentration between these two months was closely followed by another peak of chlorophyll-a content. It occurs probably because of the higher nutrient availability with sediment loading, the intensive land use with crop development, and the increase in water temperatures. Differences over time between the peaks of TSS and chlorophyll-a varied from the upper (two-month shift) to the lower (one-month shift) sections of the reservoir. They were associated with the different stream inflows and the residence time of the waters.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2589820","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico); ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7527640","Dynamics;modeling;remote sensing;time series;water resources","Reservoirs;MODIS;Remote sensing;Temperature measurement;Meteorology;Soil","hydrocarbon reservoirs;land cover;land use;regression analysis;remote sensing by radar;soil","TSS;subtropical reservoir;long-term chlorophyll variability;MODIS data;remote sensing assessment;total suspended solid;MODIS MCD43A4 data;MOD09A1 product;soil;precipitation;TSS concentration;chlorophyll-a content;nutrient availability;crop development;land use;water temperature;residence time","","4","","57","","1 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The three-node FD mode can increase spectral efficiency, especially in the low transmit power regime, without requiring FD capability at user devices. However, when a large set of users are scheduled in this mode, self-interference at the base station and user-to-user interference can substantially hinder the potential gains of FD communications. This paper investigates the problem of grouping users to pairs and assigning frequency channels to each pair in a spectral efficient and fair manner. Specifically, the joint problem of user uplink/downlink frequency channel pairing and power allocation is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear problem that is solved by a novel joint fairness assignment maximization algorithm. Realistic system-level simulations indicate that the spectral efficiency of the users having the lowest spectral efficiency is increased by the proposed algorithm, while a high ratio of connected users in different loads and self-interference levels is maintained.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2604802","CNPq, a Brazilian Research Support Agency; The Lars Hierta Memorial Foundation; Wireless@KTH Project BUSE; ","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557082","Full-duplex;user pairing;frequency assignment;power control;cellular networks","Resource management;Interference cancellation;Wireless communication;Interference;Power control;Gain;Base stations","cellular radio;frequency division multiplexing;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation","cellular networks;full-duplex communication;fair user pairing;spectral efficiency;transmission mode;base station;half-duplex user transmissions;self-interference;user-to-user interference;user uplink-downlink frequency channel pairing;power allocation;mixed integer nonlinear problem;fairness assignment maximization","","18","","31","","31 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Observation of 125 public administration websites reveals that the more limited the sphere of government, the lower the level of transparency is. In other words, Brazilian central government is more transparent than the state ones, and these, in turn, are more transparent than the municipal governments.

This article is an application of the methodology adopted in EN15232 for a case study in an educational institution. It deals with the energy saving estimation of an educational institution classroom through the use of automation based on the EN15232. To that, it was make use of projects factors, calculated the loads and determined the energy demand. With the knowledge gained from the equations of BAC efficiency factors, is possible to assess the energy savings that leads to a 16 % reduction.

Created over Arduino development board and mounted on a custom circuit board, designed on an open source tool, and embedded on a laser cut box, this tool, called LabDuino, works like an experiment repository, where the student can choose the subject to be explored, then an experiment and run it following instructions, (sensors setup, initial data and so on), presented on the tool's display. The LabDuino is capable to gathering, process, show and optionally store on SD card, up to eight sensors data, promoting a hands-on experience from setting up to experiment execution in a seamless way. It was tested on a Brazilian seventh grade class, where was taught gravity force and it's effects by doing a dropping test, inspired on egg drop experiment. Was observed an increase of 14% on the experiment class grades and a more engaged students by running the experiments.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757360","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757360","LabDuino;Arduino;Embedded Software;Educational Technology;Scientific Education;STEM;Constructionism","Sensors;STEM;Hardware;Programming profession;Laser beam cutting","computer aided instruction;natural sciences computing;public domain software","open source tool;science education;embedded tool;Arduino development board;circuit board;LabDuino;SD card","","1","","19","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main parameters present or not in all standards were listed, and the simulations were conducted in order to highlight how each one differs or resembles from one another. The default method of voltage regulation is by altering the inverter power factor, and most standards follow the same behavior curve, only differing by the value of some of the parameters, which causes most of them to behave similarly. The IEEE standard is the only one to diverge, having no power factor delimitation. The Brazilian standard proves to be the strictest one.","2164-0610","978-1-5090-3792-6","10.1109/ICHQP.2016.7783387","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783387","Low voltage;Photovoltaic systems;Standards;Voltage regulation","Reactive power;Voltage control;Inverters;Low voltage;IEC Standards;Photovoltaic systems","IEEE standards;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;power factor;power generation control;power grids;voltage control","photovoltaic generator;low-voltage residential voltage regulation;PV power injection;inverter power factor;IEEE standard;PV inverter;power grid","","","","20","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Brazilian territory sits on one of the most affected areas of the globe, where the ionosphere behaves very unpredictably, with strong scintillation frequently occurring in the local postsunset hours. The correlation between scintillation occurrence and sharp variations in the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) in Brazil is demonstrated in Spogli et al. (2013). The compounded effect of these associated ionospheric disturbances on long baseline GNSS kinematic positioning is studied in this paper, in particular when ionospheric maps are used to aid the positioning solution. The experiments have been conducted using data from GNSS reference stations in Brazil. The use of a regional TEC map generated under the CALIBRA (Countering GNSS high-Accuracy applications Limitations due to Ionospheric disturbances in BRAzil) project, referred to as CALIBRA TEC map (CTM), was compared to the use of the Global Ionosphere Map (GIM), provided by the International GNSS Service (IGS). Results show that the use of the CTM greatly improves the kinematic positioning solution as compared with that using the GIM, especially under disturbed ionospheric conditions. Additionally, different hypotheses were tested regarding the precision of the TEC values obtained from ionospheric maps, and its effect on the long baseline kinematic solution evaluated. Finally, this study compares two interpolation methods for ionospheric maps, namely, the Inverse Distance Weight and the Natural Neighbor.","1944-799X","","10.1002/2015RS005933","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7773894","","Delays;Kinematics;Mathematical model;Receivers;Ionosphere;Standards;Atmospheric modeling","","","","","","","","9 Dec 2016","","","AGU","AGU Journals"

Here, these algorithms were applied in distribution systems with distributed generation (DG), and were compared and analyzed the behavior of the APS. The proposed adaptive protection method by frequency estimation was applied in a real Brazilian sub-transmission system, owned by Eletrobrs Distributer of Alagoas (EDAL). APS was built using ATP/MODELS. The evaluation methodology for the frequency estimators is based in statistical error such as mean square error. The DFT based estimator presented better results in comparison with the other evaluated algorithms.

Being normally implemented with wireless cards or by hand, this procedure can implies on large queues, reducing the emloyee productivity, besides being sensitive to longer complications (when the employee forget to register the clocking, for example). In this context, we developed a model named ACID (Automatic Clocking and Idleness Detection) to bring benefits for both administrators and employees through the use of wireless sensors. Besides eliminating queues, it is possible to analyze those employees that are away from their own places for more than a particular threshold. In addition, the model is also pertinent to enhance decision support when promotions take place. We developed a prototype that was evaluated through simulation, taking into account the architectural plant and the employees behavior of five real Brazilian companies. The results reveals the benefits of using IDAC both at the owner (control and productivity) and employees (the clocking actions occurs automatically) levels.","","978-1-5090-1633-4","10.1109/CLEI.2016.7833345","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833345","Wireless Sensors;Clocking;Idleness Management;Resource Management;Self-Organizing","Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Context modeling;Registers;Companies","wireless sensor networks","enterprise environment;wireless card;ACID model;automatic clocking and idleness detection model;wireless sensors;queue elimination;automatic clocking and idleness management model","","","","","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on the provision of federation functionalities offered at a higher architectural level than current approaches by being deployed on top of the IaaS cloud orchestrators of each federation member. Fogbow is endowed with great flexibility due to the use of plugins that allow for the definition of precise interaction points between the federation middleware and the underlying cloud orchestrator. The resulting architecture, which relies on standards for conciliating different orchestrators' peculiarities, is thereby able to provide a common API to decouple federation functionalities from the orchestrator functionalities. Fogbow has been deployed to federate the private clouds of the members of the consortium of the EUBrazilCC project, and is also being used in an experimental federation that is part of the cloud initiative of the Brazilian National Research and Education Network (NREN) operator, as well as in an experimental deployment that aims at federating private clouds belonging to two large public companies in Brazil.","","978-1-5090-2461-2","10.1109/WAINA.2016.128","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471192","cloud federation;standards;interoperability;cloud-based applications","Cloud computing;Resource management;Standards;Computer architecture;Interoperability;Authorization","cloud computing;middleware","cloud provider flexible federation;EUBrazil cloud connect approach;cloud e-infrastructure;Fogbow;middleware;IaaS cloud provider;API;private cloud","","2","","9","","19 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several documents are produced during the process such as Term of Reference, Contract of Supplier, and Term of Closing the Contract. The documents produced during the IT procurement process must comply with the legal requirements defined in IN 04/2014, as well as being aligned with the IT necessities described in the IT Master Plan and the Strategic Institutional Plan. This paper presents an approach to answer the research question: “how we can guarantee that planning of procurement for IT solutions realized by Brazilian federal public organizations complies legally with the IN 04/2014?” The approach supports legal compliance verification through traceability links between legal requirements of IN 04/2014, procurement planning documents, and institutional planning documents (Strategic Institutional Plan and IT Master Plan). The approach is detailed through an example and the its main contributions are: (i) reduces manual work necessary to verification of legal compliance within the set of documents produced; (ii) supports in auditing and control of contracting of IT solutions in Brazil's federal public administrative sphere; (iii) gives incentive to good IT governance and transparency of information.","","978-1-5090-3694-3","10.1109/REW.2016.046","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815629","legal compliance;planning procurement for IT;legal requirement traceability","Law;Procurement;Planning;Contracts;Information technology;Syntactics","legislation;procurement;public administration","IT procurement planning;federal public administration;Brazil;Normative Ruling 04/2014;IN 04/2014;procurement planning documents;institutional planning documents;strategic institutional plan;IT master plan;IT governance;information transparency","","","","39","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these waters, the usual black pixel assumption in the Near Infra-Red (NIR, 700–1000 nm) bands is often invalid due to high backscattering from suspended particulate matter (SPM) present in the water. In this work, an atmospheric correction scheme is presented to estimate water reflectance in the 865 nm NIR band. This scheme is based on shifting the black pixel assumption to the Short-Wave-Infra-Red (SWIR, 1000–3000 nm) bands and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition of simulated atmosphere-interface reflectances. To estimate the latter component in the top of atmosphere (TOA) signal, the weight of each of these PCA eigenvectors is determined from the SWIR bands in a per-pixel-basis. The algorithm was theoretically tested from a set of simulated TOA reflectances performed considering atmospheric conditions and in-situ water reflectance data from RdP. Four schemes were analyzed using different sets of SWIR bands present in MODIS and SABIA-Mar (future Argentinian-Brazilian ocean color mission) sensors. These sets differ from each other in their correlation to the NIR and the validity of the black pixel assumption. Without considering instrument noise, the scheme with better performance is the one in which water reflectance is negligible in the SWIR bands considered: 1640 nm (SABIA-Mar/MODIS) and 2130 nm (MODIS).","","978-1-4673-9765-0","10.1109/ARGENCON.2016.7585311","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7585311","","MODIS;Reflectivity;Principal component analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Aerosols;Sea measurements;Oceans","","","","","","18","","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because it is a new subject, which requires in-depth studies and an adjustment period, many questions arise regarding its operation. Thus, this paper presents an analysis of the different net metering schemes possibilities in Brazil and its insertion in the national regulatory background. Results show that Brazilian net metering scheme has great potential for encouraging small scale solar photovoltaic in Brazil, providing great business opportunities and low payback time. However, challenges such as electricity taxation and distribution network operators' revenue have to be addressed smartly in the near future in order to push market development without compromising distributed generation viability.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2016.7786351","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ez76.periodicos.capes.gov.br/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7786351","distributed generation;net metering;regulation;solar power generation","Distributed power generation;IEEE transactions;Photovoltaic systems;Gases;Renewable energy sources;Electric potential","distributed power generation;metering;photovoltaic power systems;power markets","net metering scheme;Brazil;barrier reduction;small scale renewable energy based distributed generation development;small scale solar photovoltaic;push market development","","4","","","","16 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Chu-Beasley Genetic Algorithm (CBGA) is used for finding feasible optimal expansion plans. Uncertainties are included by scenario reduction to obtain robust expansion plans capable of meeting the uncertainty set. The approach allows finding robust expansion plans to cope with the uncertainties in load forecasting and also to take advantage of wind generation.
